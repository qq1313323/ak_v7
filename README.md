#### The `converted` folder:
The `converted` folder is the main folder, it contains the taiwan files that have been converted in order to work with v7.\
These files usually need a few more tweaks to get a working server.\
The most common issue is the S_Node.ini problem where you have to remove some maps in order to get the server to boot.

#### The `client` and the `server` folders:
The `client` and the `server` folders contain files that work right out of the box. Just copy and paste them into your client and server and start the game.\
These files are not updated regularly and can therefore be very outdated.

#### The `taiwan` folder:
The `taiwan` folder contains the Taiwan files, they cannot be used directly with v7.\
They are listed here for reference.
