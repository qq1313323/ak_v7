31|Crusader's Crucible|An Unwilling Hero|As the village fell under attack, a man pressed the Holy Sword into the tennager's hands, bidding him care for it with his life. Before the youth could protest, the man had teleported him away from the area.

Just as you launched a search party to track him down and finish him off, a soldier ran up to you in spite of his wounded leg, and informed you that the troops at the entrance had been cornered by a force of demons. Simmond and Arliss felt they had no choice but to stay behind and help defend against the incoming tide of demon warriors.|
45|Crusader's Crucible|Lost Time|You gave it your all to bring Winston down, but it hadn't mattered. The Queen had still managed to abscond with the Force of Time.

49|Crusader's Crucible|Demon's Deception|You shared a knowing glance with Isai, and without words, the two of you resolved to take down the Queen.

She had recovered her memory of Loki's deception, and she didn't seem happy about it.|
50|Crusader's Crucible|Death to the Queen|Together with the help of Isai, you managed to break the dark spell that had been afflicting the Queen. Just as she seemed to recover her memory, she was cut down by Von, who wrenched the Force of Time from her hand.

Their two souls shifted into balls of swirling light before twinkling and disappearing.|

58|Vengeful God's Grimoire|Blood Lord's Charge|Euronyme attacked Yahrune while disguised as Isai. You arrived just as Yahrune passed out from exhaustion...|
59|Vengeful God's Grimoire|Dark Descendant|Mistaking Isai for Euronyme in a disguise, the soldiers attacked Isai relentlessly. Loki took the chance to possess Isai's body during the chaos.|

61|Vengeful God's Grimoire|Do It Yourself|Von appeared at the Guardian Village and transformed into a massive dragon. He flew above the village and battered the barrier until it collapsed.|
62|Vengeful God's Grimoire|Vengeful God's Descent|Von and Euronyme appear and block your path. Isai slowly walks toward the Holy Sword and shatters the seal. A massive blast of energy knocks you back as Loki enters Terra again...|
