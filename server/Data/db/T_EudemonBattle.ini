9|Aelius' Temple IV|The road to the temple of the sun god, Aelius, is a treacherous one indeed. What reason could the bandits have for attacking the temple?|
10|Aelius' Temple V|As owner of the golden apple, perhaps Aelius will know more. Things aren't as simple as they may appear.|

23|Whirlpool III|Somehow there is a discrepancy with the perfectly charted route¡Xcould they have gone off course, or is it a part of a sinister plot?|

54|Bodhi Forest IV|The expedition pursues the infernal deer deeper and deeper into the forest's depths. Something about its behavior seems a bit strange, however.|
55|Bodhi Forest V|The infernal deer isn't as innocent as previously thought. It must be defeated to unearth the Demon King's true intentions.|
56|Bridge over the Ganges I|The group has arrived at the boundless Ganges. There's not a ship in sight, just a majestic bridge spanning its width.|
57|Bridge over the Ganges II|The Sarpa King, having claimed the river as his domain, blocks all access to the bridge. He doesn't look too friendly...|
58|Bridge over the Ganges III|A horde of Sarpa emerge from the waters of the Ganges. Although the group puts up a valiant fight, they are soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies.|
59|Bridge over the Ganges IV|Although they're surrounded, Vermilion appears to have devised a way to escape their perilous situation.|
60|Bridge over the Ganges V|Rama receives some unexpected news. Perhaps the Sarpa aren't the greatest threat after all...|
61|Kurukshetra Prairie I|Fires rage on the war-torn prairie, and the cries of the fallen can be heard just beyond a thick, acrid smoke that fills the air.|
62|Kurukshetra Prairie II|Although the battle has raged on for eighteen days, but the whereabouts of the general are unknown.|
63|Kurukshetra Prairie III|In the heat and chaos of battle, it's all but impossible to tell friend from foe...|
64|Kurukshetra Prairie IV|Bringing any sense of order to the battle is a futile task, making the search especially difficult.|

67|The Snowy Peak II|The group senses a presence lurking in the shadows, watching them, but they can't tell if it's a friend or foe...|
68|The Snowy Peak III|The weather on Snowy Peak is acting strange. It appears someone is manipulating the elements to slow the group's progress.|
69|The Snowy Peak IV|Although they're met with countless obstacles, everyone continues to climb the Snowy Peak with unabated fervor.|
70|The Snowy Peak V|It appears that their hasty advance has angered the guardian of Snowy Peak. A battle seems inevitable.|
71|Indra Palace I|Following instructions from the Snow Goddess, the party arrives at Indra Palace, located deep within the mountain's territory.|
72|Indra Palace II|Theda is justifiably overjoyed at having escaped, but she makes an unexpected request...|
73|Indra Palace III|The party follows Theda into Indra Palace, but Vermilion starts to suspect that something isn't right.|
74|Indra Palace IV|All she can do is observe her and look for anything out of the ordinary.|
75|Indra Palace V|Rama's behavior only reinforces what Vermilion suspects. What could the enemy's motive be?|
76|Shangri-La I|Following the War God's instructions, the party crosses the Snowy Peak. The land before their eyes is none other than Shangri-La itself, the legendary land of mystery.|
77|Shangri-La II|The land is full of mysterious echoes. The phenomenon leaves the party feeling a little unnerved.|

89|The Queen's Oasis IV|The army of dead is lead by Anubis, who appears to have some quarrel with the queen who rules the lands nearby.|

93|The Valley of Gold III|To capture the Demon King's infernal deer, a hunting expedition has been dispatched deep into the forest.|
94|The Valley of Gold IV|The goblins of the valley seem to have changed. Faust heads to the goblin lair to put an end to the dispute.|
95|The Valley of Gold V|The goblins are nowhere to be seen. Instead, Faust meets a mysterious masked man who has no interest in playing nice...|
96|Mausoleum I|A deathly miasma is engulfing the valley. Faust locates its source.|

103|Volcanic Ruins III|In the heat and chaos of battle, it's all but impossible to tell friend from foe...|

105|Volcanic Ruins V|Faust won't give up until he deciphers the secret of the immortal bird.|
106|Stone Altar I|Ancient tombs allude to the existence of an immortal mage. Faust would like to pay him a visit.|
107|Stone Altar II|On the way to the stone altar, Faust runs into trouble...|
108|Stone Altar III|A magic barrier surrounds the stone altar. Just as Faust is standing there scratching his head and wondering what to do, things take a turn for the better...|
109|Stone Altar IV|With the assistance of the mysterious woman, Morgana, Faust breaks through the magical barrier. However, things are never that simple...|
110|Stone Altar V|Morgana, who covets the legendary chalice, is defeated by Faust. However, she won't give up that easily...|
111|The Hanging Gardens I|The spring water from the Hanging Gardens gives eternal life, and it's Faust's last chance.|
112|The Hanging Gardens II|The spring water of the Hanging Gardens supports a unique ecology. It looks like this is going to be a wonderful journey.|
113|The Hanging Gardens III|Although the journey has already presented many obstacles, it seems an even greater challenge awaits him...|
114|The Hanging Gardens IV|Faust meets Wilfred, a man who obtained immortality by drinking the spring water from the Hanging Gardens.|
115|The Hanging Gardens V|Wilfred gained eternal life, but lost something even more precious in the process. Before the newly enlightened Faust reaches the fountain of youth...|
116|Descent Into Purgatory I|After a long and treacherous journey, Faust still hasn't found the eternal truth he seeks. However, he remains steadfast in the pursuit of his goal.|
117|Descent Into Purgatory II|He's unable to find the demon he signed the agreement with, though it seems Mephistopheles isn't the only danger that awaits him...|
118|Descent Into Purgatory III|Faust isn't going to surrender his immortal soul without a fight! He uses every skill at his disposal to devastate his demonic foes.|
119|Descent Into Purgatory IV|Mephistopheles toys with Faust. Things are looking grim for our intrepid hero.|
120|Descent Into Purgatory V|Faust staunchly fights off Mephistopheles' savage attacks, but how will it all end?|
121|Ancient Walled City I|Uzuriel arrived in Terra on a mission at God's command, but the city's atmosphere immediately felt oppressive.|
122|Ancient Walled City II|Uzuriel was vanquishing monsters left and right, but she couldn't locate their leader.|
123|Ancient Walled City III|Once Uzuriel made her way to the city center, she began to focus her search.|
124|Ancient Walled City IV|It turned out that the Boss Monster had been causing chaos in the city center. Go!|
125|Ancient Walled City V|The Demon Aebordoon had been controlling the corrupted humans. Uzuriel needed to destroy it if she was going to cleanse the city for good.|
126|City of Angels I|Mission complete. Uzuriel turned Aeberdoon's final words over in her head as she prepared to return to the Aura Kingdom.|
127|City of Angels II|Uzuriel noticed that her wings looked a bit strange...|
128|City of Angels III|Uzuriel felt as though something had changed within her, and she got the feeling Aebardoon may have had something to do with it.|
129|City of Angels IV|Uzuriel stood outside the gates, but something didn't feel right.|
130|City of Angels V|It's Dante! But he seemed upset, and he had a strange expression.|
131|Gate of Judgment I|Uzuriel found out about the Forbidden Fruit's properties, and wanted to ask God about what Dante had said.|
132|Gate of Judgment II|Uzuriel decided to meet with God. It seems a little impulsive, but she didn't see any way around it.|
133|Gate of Judgment III|Uzuriel took care to avoid the guards, and crept closer.|
134|Gate of Judgment IV|The closer she got, the more guards she saw patrolling. She had to find a faster way to reach her goal.|
135|Gate of Judgment V|God was just out of reach, when something completely unexpected happened...|
136|Tree of Knowledge I|Uzuriel had been kicked out by Michaela, so she decided to go to the Tree of Knowledge to look for clues.|
137|Tree of Knowledge II|The Tree of Knowledge was a calm and peaceful place, and it quickly soothed Uzuriel's body and mind.|
138|Tree of Knowledge III|Uzuriel slept for a while, until she was awoken.|
139|Tree of Knowledge IV|Uzuriel thumbed through the sea of books searching for answers about the Forbidden Fruit.|
140|Tree of Knowledge V|As Uzuriel was reaching for the black leatherbound tome, Raziel snatched it away.|
141|Angel Tears Spring I|Uzuriel had managed to lose Raziel, and looked for a quiet corner where she could read.|
142|Angel Tears Spring II|Finding a quiet spot in the Aura Kingdom was the most important task right now.|
143|Angel Tears Spring III|Recalling the Angel Tears Spring, she finally smiled.|
144|Angel Tears Spring IV|Uzuriel arrived a t the Angel Tears Spring. She had Uriel had a lot of fond memories here.|
145|Angel Tears Spring V|Who were these intruders?|
146|Galaxy Bridge I|Uzuriel was bewildered, having learned the true nature of the Forbidden Fruit.|
147|Galaxy Bridge II|The creatures at the Galaxy Bridge had gone berserk. Could it have been related to the demons somehow?|
148|Galaxy Bridge III|Uzuriel followed the trail left by the demons and wild creatures, and was shocked at what she found,|
149|Galaxy Bridge IV|Uzuriel couldn't make sense of what she had learned, so she decided to ask Uriel for advice.|
150|Galaxy Bridge V|Uzuriel managed to find Uriel, who was in the middle of setting flame to a pack of demons.|
151|Ancient Battlefield I|After the fight with Uriel, Uzuriel knew it was too late to back down now. She would have to leave the Aura Kingdom behind.|
152|Ancient Battlefield II|It felt as though there's an unseen pressure hanging over the gates of the Aura Kingdom. What was causing it?|
153|Ancient Battlefield III|Dante had revolted. He wanted to harness the Forbidden Fruit's power and use it to destroy the Tree of Knowledge. This could not be allowed to happen.|
154|Ancient Battlefield IV|Uzuriel found herself surrounded by Banoleth's minions. She would have to deal with them before she could go on.|
155|Ancient Battlefield V|Uzuriel had to defeat Banoleth if she was going to protect the Aura Kingdom.|
156|Aura Kingdom's Gate I|Now that the monsters were gone, she could finally leave the Aura Kingdom. But things are never that easy.|
157|Aura Kingdom's Gate II|Uzuriel struggled to lose Michaela and plan her escape.|
158|Aura Kingdom's Gate III|This was a quest given by God himself. Michaela needed to find a way to stop Uzuriel at any cost.|
159|Aura Kingdom's Gate IV|Michaela finally confronted Uzuriel, hoping she would have a change of heart. But would Uzuriel really listen?|
160|Aura Kingdom's Gate V|Everyone has differences... It was time to go.|
