30|Eirene: Everything is so peaceful!

Harmonia: So peaceful. I feel happy just listening to silence...

Hebe: Please go on. I'll be merciful. 

Aelius: What a lovely scene.
It's even disturbing.|
29|Serena: If you keep chasing me,
don't blame me when I start attacking you! 

Aelius: Sister... I am sorry...
What can I do to make you forgive me?

Tsukuyomi: I agree with the Moon Rabbits.
The sun is no good! 

Amaterasu: Don't be silly. Don't mess with me!|
28|Aelius: What a wonderful day! 
Let's go hunting together! 

Ullr: Of course! The Knight of Glory will not refuse! 

Bealdor: Look at this... If you invite me with so much enthusiasm,
I cannot say no! 

Tyr: Hmph, one day I will be very strong... *Cough*|
27|Endora: I'm not afraid of fighting against Serif!
 

Pandora: There's nothing I can offer to Dante,
because I already offered my heart to him! 

Muse: change your mind, sing all over the world
and show your true self! 

Venus: That's the most touching and sincere feeling in the world.|
26|Alucard: Finally! The person I've been looking for
appears in front of me...

Hades: I've been waiting... No, it's okay. 

Bealdor: I... I... *sniff*... I don't know if it is love or not,
but I can't stop thinking about her...

Dante: That's enough for you.|
25|Uriel: The concert is on! 

Muse: Everybody sparkles like me!

Zephyrine: The weather is clear. The sun is high.

Cesela: No, that isn't right...
You are not from our band, are you?|
24|Justicia: Each of us has a different fire flame.
Let me study them! 

Cerberus: As the Hellheim Guardian, I can't let you know...
What's with the Honey Cookies? Are you bribing me?!

Aoandon: I'm a light fire wandering through the night.
I hope someone will come to finish the story...

Uriel: Haha! Each fire flame is fun!|
23|Kitami: Warm sunshine and wind! 
I just want to roll on the grass all day long!

Demeter:
Let's enjoy nature's gift together!

Hansel and Gretel: Picnic! Let's have a picnic!

Sakuya-hime: There is some nectar
and beautiful cherry blossoms... I'm so happy!|
22|Eirene: This weather...
It is too cold to move...

Shirayuki: I'd do whatever it takes to bring him back...

Eternia:
Shirayuki's emotions affect the environment. This must be recorded...

Undine: Connect with the Almighty God!
This is a land of Ice and snow...|
21|Ares: Come on, Tyr! 
Let's have a Lightning fight! 

Tyr: You dare challenge the Heroic Glory?
You must have lost your senses! 

Hermes: It sounds like fun. Hermes wants to play, too.

Seiryuu: Are you guys practicing? 
This is a great opportunity to see how good you are!|
20|Astraea: My light can eradicate all the evil of the world! 

Michaela: My light can protect all precious treasures. 

Amaterasu: My light can illuminate everyone's words...

Serena: It's so dazzling... it reminds me of someone...|
19|Nidhogg: I can feel that the Dante is very strong.
I should find a chance to fight him...

Pandora: Of course, Dante is the best! 
There is no rival to him! 

Succubus: What?
Pandora is always so blatant...

Elizabeth: There's a kind of happiness
that can only be enjoyed in the dark...|
18|Hel: Instead of training the whole time,
we should find some sparkly gems! 

Eternia: Let me see...
I remember something about some ancient crystals...

Eirene:
It's a beautiful treasure from the past. 

Verdandi: Looking for ancient treasures and creating new memories, isn't it exciting?
|
17|Sakuya-hime: The flowers are so beautiful today.
I can feel their power!

Idun: Hmm...
Even the crops in the Idun Orchard are growing really well! 

Sif: Come help little Idun to harvest.

Demeter: Huh? The Golden Apple is getting bigger!|
16|Venus: A beautiful life, a gorgeous battle.
The perfect combination.

Elizabeth: Indeed! Even the common people...
they also need a proper home. 

Harmonia: And what's more...
isn't it difficult for people to live together? 

Lumikki: It's like living happily ever after as the prince and the princess in a fairytale.
|
15|Hansel and Gretel: Let's not fight today!
Let's have an elegant tea party!

Alice: Fancy! But it will cost a lot of money...

Ayako: Let's do it! I want to eat a lot of meat! 

Tyr: Let's start the Afternoon Tea Party preparing a meal.|
14|Tyr: Well... We should combine hard work and leisure,
but I don't want to stop training! 

Ayako: Fishing! Make some money! Buy some meat!

Undine: How romantic!

Venus: Fishing...
Is that how a fish ends up in a dish?|
13|Eternia: Every moment of life is worth recording...
Don't ever think otherwise... 

Verdandi: Isn't it wonderful to enjoy the present
and the music? 

Justicia: When you feel confused, just sit still
and look for the answers in your heart. 

Dante: Make a choice and don't regret it!|
12|Diao Chan: When it comes to fight or dress up,
I give 100%!

Yumikaze: Fighting and dressing up... What we need is financial support
and hard work! 

Vermilion Bird: The Southern Star said that a woman should be independent...
Why do we always have to be by the Master's side, then?

Kotonoha: Of course! Dressing up is important and loyalty, too.|
11|Amaterasu: The rude Tsukuyomi is better suited to fighting in battle
than ruling the Land of Midnight Snacks.

Tsukuyomi: Nonsense! The Land of the Night is very wealthy...
Everyone will just follow my orders.

Cesela: Eh... if you want to tease Serena,
I will show you a few tricks. 

Serena: You're so good and reliable!
You will achieve everything you want.|
10|Ares: Keep attacking with great power
and the victory will be ours! 

Astraea: You are reckless! 
There are many ways of winning a war. 

Ullr: Dirty killings will only offend the ladies!
A knight should only fight for his faith. 

Michaela: Fighting can lead to death, but sometimes, in order to protect...
you need to fight.|
9|Nidhogg: The best way to get rid of weaklings
is bringing chaos! 

Elizabeth: That's rude,
the nobles can still deal with it gracefully and reach the victory.

Dante: Ha! I am tired of wasting my time with such an arrogant... 

Seiryuu: Wait a minute. Don't you think we should help the weak,
now that we're strong?|
8|Endora:
It's so great that no one can catch me!

Hermes: Hey!
Do you want to bet who gets faster?

Kitami: Well... I'd like to join... but I'm a little scared...

Aoandon: You won't do it.
And the reason is obvious...|
7|Elizabeth: With some little tricks,
every girl can be a beautiful gem...

Hel: What? Are you talking about the glittering gems? 

Venus: Well...
your eyes are as beautiful as gems. 

Harmonia: Haha!
Of course, every girl emits a natural and dazzling light...|
6|Grimm: There are many legendary creatures,
but dragons are the strongest of them all! 

Alucard: Whatever form I take,
I will always fight by your side! 

Seiryuu: Right! We are friends,
good friends! 

Nidhogg: Wait until you're strong enough...
I'll enjoy beating you up!|
5|Hansel and Gretel: Brother, tell a story while fighting!
Listen Gretel

Lumikki:
Hansel was telling me that the white horse has come to take the Princess. 

Undine: Zzz...
Tell me the one about my sister turning into a bubble...

Alice:.. If I don't focus on fighting, I'll get hurt easily.|
4|Hades: Besides my training,
I'm devoted to the Pandemonium. 

Izanami: I am the Ruler of Acheron.
You can talk to Hades for advice...

Aoandon: I heared that Dante devours souls... 

Dante: What are you talking about?
Where did you hear that?|
3|Harmonia: Every death in battle
means a sudden loss of life... 

Eirene: Can you feel it? The world is so rich and beautiful...

Hebe: I'll play you some music to dispel your frustrations.

Qingniao: Let me give you a feather.
I hope it cheers you up!|
2|Endora: These minions are no match for me.
Would you like to go shopping instead? 

Zashi: If I don't have any plans with my friends I love staying in bed for hours.


Zephyrine: Why don't you sleep on the back of Nakama with me?

Succubus: *yawn* It looks like it's feast time!
|
1|Serif: Stay positive and face every battle with a smile! 

Merrilee: It doesn't matter if you are rich or poor,
you must always remain positive! 

Alessa: Our friendship is like a fragant flower:
simple but unique. 123

Grimm: No matter what, we will always be together!|
