110614|This place is too noisy... Fishing's better.|
110613|I thought I saw a cute little creature...|
110612|...Be quiet.|
110611|Stop looking and stop touching!|
110610|You won't be able to wield my hammer... Just give up.|
110609|Watch out for my armor.|
110602|Huh... Hmm... What? Ahh... It's a dream!|
110601|Let's see if there's any interesting dreams today!|
110600|Huh... Hmm...|
110599|Can I come into your dreams?|
110598|Do you want to sleep with me?|
110597|Is my hair soft to the touch?|
110596|The snow in the Land of the Night... It should be beautiful, right?|
110595|Silent Night... Christmas Night... cough It's so embarrassing for me to practice singing...|
110594|Are you trying to trick me?|
110593|Take this snowball!|
110592|Don't keep saying I'm cute! I'm not a child!|
110591|Do you want to exchange gifts with me?|
110590|Muse's fans sent lots of Christmas Presents! Muse is really happy!|
110589|Yates, do you think Muse's Christmas outfit looks good?|
110588|Please support Muse!|
110587|Muse is getting ready for the winter performance. So Muse won't be accepting any interviews right now.|
110586|If you're cold, Muse will sing a song to keep you warm!|
110585|Hmm? Master, you can't.|
110584|Next time you see Tsukuyomi... Just call him uncle...|
110583|Hmph... Kaiser Zeta better not think of getting close to my daughter...|
110582|You think you can steal my juice?|
110581|Don't blame me if you come into contact with any Snake Venom!|
110580|If you have some grape juice, bring it to honor me!|
110579|You...Does it smell like grape juice?|
99412|#821$#Why should we ever separate? If you fall asleep, I can wake you with my hammer.|
99411|#821$#...I never thought about it, and I'm not going to think about it.|
99410|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
99409|#821$#But I'm here to carry out an important quest for the Four Gods...
#822$#You want to help? Hmm... You just need to adventure on happily...|
99408|#821$#They always talk about you.
#821$#The Envoy of Gaia, who exudes warmth and energy...
#823$#Hmm... I guess they're right...|
99407|Why did you come to Terra?|
99406|#822$#And it even enables me to fly for a short distance...
#824$#What are you doing? Go away! It can't carry two people!|
99405|#821$#You mean the chain armor?
#822$#Don't just look at it as an armor. They can move like a snake!|
99404|The armor on your back is really special.|
99403|#824$#...Taste my hammer!|
99402|#824$#...Do you have a dying wish?|
99401|You have a great figure.|
99400|#822$#Seiryuu is the eldest of us all.
#821$#She takes good care of us too. She's also a worthy opponent!|
99399|#821$#I... I'm actually as old as Kitami.
#822$#Can't you see? I think my chest is too... Forget it.|
99398|Can you tell me the age of the Four Gods?|
99397|#821$#I remember Kitami has a title called "God of War",
#822$#but she actually really hates the title and fighting.|
99396|#821$#I'm actually envious of the Plump Bird following Vermilion...
#822$#The Plump Bird can be quite noisy, but it's really cute..
#821$#My master? He said Terra is too noisy...|
99395|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
99394|#822$#You want to try holding it?
#823$#But my Cosmic Hammer contains the power of the Milky Way... You won't be able to wield it.|
99393|#821$#It's called the Cosmic Hammer.
#823$#It contains the powers of the Milky Way, and it's made for the constellations.|
99392|Your hammer looks amazing.|
99391|#821$#There's a huge stone sculpture in my hometown.
#821$#It was made from a snake spirit and a giant turtle.
#822$#Although I'd like to show you, we can't let outsiders in there.|
99390|#823$#It's a dark place, but it surrounds the ever shining Milky Way...
#822$#Its dazzling brilliance gives me great warmth.|
99389|Tell me about your hometown.|
99388|#822$#Instead of relying on superstitions,
#823$#why don't you go train yourself?|
99387|#821$#It's just a hunch.
#821$#If you've been fighting for a long time, you'll gain a certain intuition of danger, right?|
99386|I heard that you do Fortune-Telling?|
99385|#822$#Aren't Earthworms also bird feed...?
#821$#But the Plump Bird next to Vermilion doesn't seem to like eating them...|
99384|#821$#Seiryuu once said that fishing is also a kind of meditation.
#822$#More importantly, it's an activity that requires stillness.|
99383|About fishing.|
99382|#823$#But I've heard that it can give people a sense of belonging...
#822$#I guess it's like a second home.|
99381|#821$#It sounds like a lot of people and a lot of noises...|
99380|Have you heard of Guilds?|
99379|#824$#Did I do something wrong that needs punishing?
#821$#Can't you change it to swinging the hammer a hundred times?
#821$#I don't want to use my brains...|
99378|#821$#Don't look for me for such a brainy thing...|
99377|Transmitting Information.|
99376|#821$#...But I don't want to go anywhere near Helonia.
#824$#The parrots there are very noisy, and I hate noises.|
99375|#822$#Hmm... Have you heard of Ventos Prairie?
#823$#There's a vast plain and the grass there is really comfortable.
#823$#I bet Kitamis would like it.|
99374|Is there somewhere you would like to visit?|
99373|#822$#I'm better at wielding a Lance than a Great Axe.
#821$#After all, it's been a long time since I practiced with Seiryuu.|
99372|#821$#Hmm... It's a little similar to the weapon I use,
#821$#but the axe uses a sharp blade,
#822$#and my hammer depends on absolute force.|
99371|Can you tell me about the Great Axe?|
99370|#821$#Barbecuing... does that count?
#821$#Seiryuu likes to eat a lot after a practice.
#822$#Also, the Plump Bird that follows the Vermilion will appear out of nowhere, demanding noisily for it...
#823$#Hmm? Well, it's a happy memory.|
99369|#822$#Hmm... I can lift a hammer three times the weight of a man.
#823$#I can also use it for close combat easily.|
99368|Do you have a specialty?|
99367|#822$#Okay, but before we go, I have a list here that needs to be checked off...
#822$#Like, lance wax, the latest cat bells, and organic bird feed...|
99366|#821$#I'll leave such things in your hands.
#822$#I'll follow you wherever you want to go.|
99365|Do you like to travel?|
99364|#821$#I don't know really know what you want me to say.
#822$#Anyway... Whenever we run into an argument,
#823$#a hammer solves most problems.|
99363|#821$#I have three sisters.
#821$#Although they are all different in personality and race,
#822$#they're my most precious family.|
99362|Any advice for me about relationships?|
99361|#821$#I hate noises and noisy people.
#822$#But you? I won't hate you...
#822$#...you are, very kind.|
99360|#824$#When Seiryuu gets injured, Kitami starts crying, and Vermilion gets bullied.|
99359|Is there anything you don't like?|
99358|#821$#Seiryuu always admires you...
#822$#So, I want to try fighting you too.|
99357|#823$#Enough talk. Let's just get to it!|
99356|What do you know about the God of Battle?|
99355|#823$#And I'll do some basic training...
#821$#This way, I can practice with Seiryuu.|
99354|#821$#Catch little bugs.
#823$#You don't like that?
#821$#Kitami always enjoys doing it.|
99353|What do you do to kill time?|
99292|#821$#(yawns) I should have beautiful dreams for the new year!
#822$#Let me take you into a dream that we will never be separated!|
99291|#824$#...Is this a nightmare?
#821$#(yawns) I need to wake up... Then I'll go with you for the New Year countdown.|
99290|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
99289|#821$#(yawns) Are you inviting me to sleep together?
#822$#Huh? No?|
99288|#821$#...Hmm? ...Hmm... Aren't you here with me?|
99287|Do you ever meet with family over the festival?|
99286|#822$#Hehe, if you like it,
#821$#then come and sleep with me.|
99285|#821$#(yawns) It's not only beautiful, it's also great for sleeping in.
#822$#Do you want to try sleeping on the pillow?|
99284|Your new outfit is pretty.|
99283|#821$#(yawns) To be with my favorite person in dreams
#822$#is my happiest dream!
#822$#It's a deal then... No one can wake up, alright?|
99282|#821$#My happiest dream? If you want to know, why not come sleep with me?|
99281|What's your happiest New Year dream?|
99280|#821$#My dream pillow can become huge!
#822$#Do you want to try lying down on it?|
99279|#821$#Hehe... Doesn't it looks like you'll sleep better with it?|
99278|A new pillowcase!|
99277|#821$#And after getting drunk during the Festival Muramasa...
#821$#It smells like grape juice in your dreams...
#821$#(yawns) I'm getting tipsy from the smell...|
99276|#821$#Little Zashi always has a good sleep.
#822$#Every time I'm around her, I get to eat well!|
99275|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
99274|#821$#You are my...
#822$#(yawns) Nothing.
#821$#I was probably just talking in my dreams... Hehe...|
99273|#821$#Huh? Hmm? You mean...
#822$#Go back to that dark and terrifying place...?
#821$#I don't want to be separated from you!|
99272|Have you ever thought of going home for the New Year?|
99271|#822$#Hehe... the dreamworld at this time is full of warmth...
#821$#I can enjoy delicacies that can't be tasted at other times... Hmm...|
99270|#821$#Huh... Hmm...
#821$#Hmm? Huh? Can't you sleep during the festival?|
99269|Have you always slept through the New Year?|
99268|#824$#Why are you staring at my horn?
#821$#I feel so shy... I can't sleep like this...|
99267|#821$#Huh...? Did it get bigger again...
#824$#No... Don't look! Don't look!|
99266|Your horn looks different.|
99265|#821$#(yawns) Did I appear in your dreams? So... What did you dream about?
#822$#Huh? You feel tired after waking up? Hehe... I don't know anything...|
99264|#821$#(yawns) How should I know?
#822$#Do you really miss me so much? Do you think of me day and night?|
99263|Why do I always meet you in my dreams?|
99262|#821$#Shopping? I don't need to.
#822$#Whatever you need, I can make you dream of it.|
99261|#821$#Festival gifts? They're not even for me!
#821$#Are there any presents better than sleeping with me?
#821$#Hehe, your face is so red!|
99260|Can you tell me more about the auction?|
99259|#821$#Should we get a king-sized bed?
#821$#That way, we can sleep on it every day comfortably.|
99258|#821$#(yawns) I'm not cleaning!
#822$#Wouldn't it be great just to dream of a clean room?|
99257|Housing?|
99256|#821$#(yawns) You're disturbing my dreams just for this kind of thing?|
99255|#821$#(yawns) They're just a bunch of lowly demons. They wouldn't know how to do it...
#822$#Can you not bother me with such boring topics?|
99254|Does the underworld celebrate the New Year?|
99253|#822$#If we go there at night, there'll be lots of nice dreams.
#821$#I can't wait!|
99252|#822$#Hehe... Great! Let's see if there's anything fun to do.
#821$#Huh? I'm not allowed to play pranks?! How boring...|
99251|Let's enjoy the festival in the city!|
99250|#822$#I used to visit other people's dreams to experience the New Year...
#821$#But now? With you here, I won't be cold for New Year!
#821$#(yawns) So sleepy... Let's go to bed!|
99249|#822$#Before... You mean in the underworld?
#821$#It's all dark and cold...
#821$#Terra is still the best! (yawns)|
99248|Any past impressions of the festival?|
99247|#821$#Would you like to invite me to a feast?
#821$#(yawn) Then come lie down here!
#824$#Ohh... Why are you blushing?|
99246|#821$#Hmm? So many happy and warm dreams!
#822$#I think I'll be able to eat happily.|
99245|Festival's Feast|
99244|#821$#(yawns) Do you use a pen to write?
#822$#Well, I want to write on your face...
#821$#Hehe, don't run!|
99243|#822$#Greeting card? To send messages?
#821$#(yawns) Can't you just communicate in your dreams?|
99242|Did you send anyone a festival greeting card?|
99241|#822$#(yawns) Why...? Is it a custom?
#821$#Sounds boring... I hate being bored...|
99240|#821$#(yawns) I'm so tired!
#822$#I'm going to bed first. Come keep me company when you've finished cleaning.|
99239|Let's clean up!|
99238|#821$#Firecrackers... always wake people up from their dreams...
#822$#And it's always time when I'm enjoying delicious food...
#821$#Aren't you afraid of firecrackers? Then come to bed with me!|
99237|#821$#New Year...? Can you sleep a lot during the festival?
#821$#Hmm...? No...? Hmm...|
99236|Do you like celebrating the festival?|
99235|#821$#Hmm? Happy dreams sound fun!
#822$#Do you want to play with me in the dreams?|
99234|#821$#(yawns) New Year... What should we do... Huh...|
99233|What do you do to celebrate the festival?|
99232|#821$#Are you actually... tired of seeing my youthful looks?
#821$#You should know that my true form is nothing like this!
#821$#I'm a fully grown, mature, and sexy sister!
#821$#Now you won't want to part with me, right!|
99231|#821$#Why bring up the subject of separation on the day of reunion?
#821$#You don't seem like such a person!|
99230|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
99229|#821$#I really want to see Nariko dress up for Christmas...
#821$#But that girl is always stubborn... What a pity...|
99228|#821$#You won't believe it...
#821$#That girl is actually afraid of the cold... If she doesn't have to go out in the snow, she won't...
#822$#But the short-tempered Nariko is also very cute.|
99227|Have you seen Kusanagi?|
99226|#821$#The Christmas sleigh to Santa Claus,
#821$#is like the Sacred Mirror or Magatama to me!
#821$#They're indispensable!|
99225|#821$#You shouldn't have seen me dress up...
#824$#You... Are you playing tricks on me?! I'll get angry!|
99224|What about using a Christmas sleigh?|
99223|#821$#I'm sensing a conspiracy...
#824$#But I am, Amaterasu! I won't just back down!
#824$#If he wants to fight, then let him come!|
99222|#821$#You are such a naive child!
#824$#This isn't a Christmas card! It's a declaration of war!|
99221|Orochi seems to have invited you...|
99220|#823$#Look, isn't my Sacred Mirror's light so captivating on the snow?
#821$#...I, I can't believe the snow melted... However, I am the warm Amaterasu! Hahaha!|
99219|#821$#Even though it looks different, it's not any less powerful!
#821$#The Sacred Mirror can still reveal the truth behind a person.
#822$#Do you want to try it? Ahh! You actually managed to dodge it!|
99218|The Sacred Mirror looks different.|
99217|#821$#Recently, I met Ayako, and she rushed over happily.
#821$#But when she found out that it was me, she looked very disappointed...
#821$#Was it my imagination?|
99216|#824$#That arrogant Tsukuyomi...
#824$#He's always showing off how beautiful the snow is in the Land of the Night and how suitable it is for Christmas...
#824$#Hmmph, does he really think I'll celebrate in the Land of the Night just because of that? Hmmph!|
99215|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
99214|#821$#Anyway... Talking about reindeers...
#821$#Ayako always seem so excited.
#821$#I don't think it's my imagination...|
99213|#821$#...Although my new outfit has a reindeer design,
#824$#I'm not really a reindeer!
#824$#I'll get angry if you ask me to pull the sleigh!|
99212|What do you think of reindeers?|
99211|#821$#You are my family!
#823$#Let's celebrate Christmas with you, Nariko, and I!|
99210|#824$#Christmas with that arrogant and unreasonable Tsukuyomi?
#824$#I'll feel like the entire Christmas is ruined... (cough)!|
99209|Are you celebrating Christmas with your family?|
99208|#824$#It doesn't seem right for you to say it...
#821$#What's the right word? Let me think...
#821$#Sexy, curvy, something like that!|
99207|#823$#Right? Wait! Don't treat me like a child!
#824$#You are just a baby in my eyes!|
99206|You look so cute!|
99205|#823$#You... Are you hoping to hear me say that I want to spend Christmas with you?|
99204|#821$#Nariko, of course!
#821$#Come to think about it, I haven't seen Nariko for a while.
#821$#I wonder how she's doing lately?|
99203|Who would you like to spend Christmas with?|
99202|#821$#Right, if you see a blue exclamation mark on the road...
#823$#...You knew? I knew you were a brave and upright child!|
99201|#821$#Let's check out the blue exclamation marks on the Map!
#823$#We can safeguard the light and peace while celebrating Christmas in various places too!
#823$#Don't you think that's great?|
99200|Should we look at different Christmas places?|
99199|#821$#My Christmas card?
#821$#I also want to see what you wrote...
#823$#(coughs) I'm just trying to help you check for mistakes!|
99198|#821$#You're talking about Christmas Cards, right?
#823$#I'll write one to Santa Claus...
#821$#Would you like to join me? What's with your expression?|
99197|Why don't you write a letter?|
99196|#821$#Okay! But there must be a lot of people on the streets now!
#821$#You must hold on to my hand to keep me safe!|
99195|#823$#There is a huge Christmas Tree in Holy City!
#823$#And Santa Claus will be handing out candies on the streets...
#821$#(cough)... I mean, what a great idea!|
99194|Let's enjoy Christmas in the city!|
99193|#821$#Silent Night? I haven't sung that before?
#821$#Why don't you sing it once for me first!|
99192|#821$#Huh? Me? Sing?
#821$#This... Shouldn't you be asking Aelius?|
99191|I want to hear you sing "Silent Night."|
99190|#823$#Let's put on some red and green magatama Lightbulbs...
#821$#What do you think? Isn't it wonderful?|
99189|#821$#I prepared this specially for you!
#822$#A mini Sacred Mirror!
#823$#Hurry up and put it at the top of the Christmas Tree!|
99188|Let's decorate the Christmas Tree.|
99187|#823$#Of course! He's real like you and me.
#821$#(coughs) I mean... Such a story is heartwarming... and I like it...|
99186|#823$#You are so adorable!
#822$#You better keep it up! Haha!|
99185|Do you believe in Santa Claus?|
99184|#823$#Why do you ask?
#821$#Is there anyone who doesn't like Christmas?|
99183|#821$#I am the guardian of warmth, Amaterasu!
#821$#Of course I like a warm and peaceful Christmas.
#821$#What? Although Christmas is very cold,
#821$#everyone's heart is warm during the holidays.|
99182|Do you like Christmas?|
99181|#821$#I've come prepared this time!
#823$#You must say something auspicious before I can give you the present in the red bag!
#821$#Hmm? I got the holidays mixed up?|
99180|#821$#Huh? For me?
#821$#But I remember a present should be from an elder to the young!
#821$#Are you sure?|
99179|A Christmas Present for you.|
99178|#821$#Is it an event that's carried out during Terra's Christmas?
#821$#I'll give it a try... Ahh... It's melting...
#822$#Ahaha! After all, I'm Amaterasu. Hahaha... (coughs)!|
99177|#821$#A snowball fight...? Ah! You're talking about a battle!
#821$#Even though I'm not a good fighter, I won't lose easily!|
99176|Do you want a snowball fight?|
99175|#821$#Don't worry, I can melt the ice for you!
#821$#What? This gives off a more festive atmosphere?|
99174|#821$#This reminds me of a winter with heavy snow...
#823$#And all that remained of the field was a white frost...
#823$#Even though it's beautiful, it makes people miss the sunny weather. Don't you agree?|
99173|It's snowing!|
99172|#821$#Muse will sing a song to show how important master is to Muse...
#821$#Muse hopes master will never leave after hearing it!|
99171|#821$#Muse has reserved the Christmas Tour Special Guest seat for master!
#821$#This way... Master won't part ways with Muse right?|
99170|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
99169|#821$#That person taught me... to always spread love and warmth...
#822$#...Who? Hmm... The point is, love and warmth!|
99168|#821$#To spread love and energy
#821$#on this cold winter night! Muse wants the people to feel the warmth!|
99167|Why did we come here?|
99166|#821$#Muse is used to sitting on a swing.
#821$#If Muse shows up on a sleigh, the fans will be surprised!|
99165|#821$#Having a concert on a sleigh! That sounds fun!
#822$#Yates, let's note down this idea. We can use it next year!|
99164|What about using a Christmas sleigh?|
99163|#821$#If Muse can bring everyone's hearts together
#823$#on a snowy night,
#821$#it will be Muse's greatest happiness!|
99162|#821$#Yes! It is Muse's most important activity in the winter.
#822$#Muse wants to dedicate the most perfect performance to the world! So, Muse practices hard every day!|
99161|Do you love going on Christmas tours?|
99160|#822$#Can voice be considered a natural instrument?
#821$#Muse can sing various styles of Christmas songs!|
99159|#821$#There are no specific instruments for Christmas.
#821$#Drum, harp... everything works!
#821$#Master, do you want to listen to Muse's rock and roll Christmas song that uses drums?|
99158|What about Christmas instruments?|
99157|#823$#Is master... changing into a Christmas outfit too?
#821$#Does it look like... like a couple suit with Muse?
#823$#Ah... (blush)... What is Muse saying?|
99156|#821$#Master, did you see Alice and Lumikki's Christmas outfits?
#823$#It's so shiny and cute!
#821$#But when it comes to shiny things, Muse won't lose!|
99155|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
99154|#822$#But because Yates wants to perform together, Yates has to dress up too!
#821$#Master! Hurry up and put on your Christmas outfit too!|
99153|#823$#Does master think it's cute too?
#821$#At first, Yates was not willing to change into the Christmas outfit!|
99152|Yates You look so pink.|
99151|#821$#Muse has prepared a gift for master!
#821$#Tadaaa! Muse's special Christmas album!|
99150|#823$#Did master prepare this?
#822$#What a small bell... Ah! Is master planning to give it to Yates?
#824$#Boohoo... Master has only prepared for Yates... Master is so cruel!|
99149|"Christmas presents?|
99148|#821$#This is specially chosen by Muse.
#822$#No! Muse did not try out 30 outfits!
#822$#Yates must have remembered wrongly!|
99147|#821$#This outfit was specially made for the winter tour!
#823$#It's pink and fluffy... It'll warm you up even in the cold.|
99146|You look so cute!|
99145|#822$#Of course with Yates and master too!
#821$#Let's celebrate this special night together!|
99144|#823$#Hmm... If it's with that person...
#821$#No, no... Muse is an idol! Of course Muse would spend Christmas with Muse's fans!|
99143|Who would you like to spend Christmas with?|
99142|#821$#If there's a Snowman outside the cottage, it will surely add a more Christmas atmosphere!
#822$#It would be even better if there were a Yates-shaped Snowman!|
99141|#822$#Muse's house is master's house!
#821$#About that... Can Muse request a practice room from master to prepare for the Christmas tour?|
99140|What's your house like?|
99139|#821$#Master can also buy lots of items as gifts at the auction.
#823$#But Muse thinks that a sincere heart to prepare gifts is the most important thing!|
99138|#821$#Master... Are you thinking of buying a Christmas Present?
#821$#Well... Please buy lots of Muse's Christmas Special!|
99137|Can you tell me more about the auction?|
99136|#821$#Muse remember it's where one stores their past.
#822$#Hmm? Muse's memory? That's a secret!|
99135|#821$#Muse wants to create beautiful Christmas memories with master!
#823$#And put them all into the Eternal Codex! Kept safe forever.|
99134|Eternal Codex.|
99133|#821$#You just want to listen to "Silent Night"?
#821$#Muse can sing a lot more!
#821$#Because master is special, Muse will sing them to you!|
99132|#821$#Muse will sing a song called 'Silent Night'!
#821$#Master, let's sing together!|
99131|I want to hear you sing "Silent Night."|
99130|#822$#I heard there's a huge Christmas Tree in Port Skandia!
#821$#Master, do you want to go see how the tree is decorated?|
99129|#821$#Decorating a Christmas Tree is also an art.
#822$#Master, let's decorate our Christmas Tree together!|
99128|Let's decorate the Christmas Tree.|
99127|#821$#Master, do you believe in him too?|
99126|#821$#Of course!
#821$#Love, hope, and dreams are what Muse stands for!|
99125|Do you believe in Santa Claus?|
99124|#822$#Every year, Muse uses a draw method
#821$#to choose fan letters and share them with everyone, and even reply to them.
#821$#Master, do you want to try drawing too?|
99123|#821$#Does master want Muse's letter too?
#821$#Then, master must buy Muse's new album first!|
99122|Do you want to send Christmas cards?|
99121|#822$#Every Christmas, there are more offers to collaborate!
#821$#In order to live up to the fans who come to the show,
#821$#Muse needs to spend more time practicing!|
99120|#821$#Hmm... Fans will send lots of letters and presents every Christmas.
#823$#And Muse is very moved by their gestures!|
99119|Impressions of Christmas?|
99118|#821$#Master, Muse can't do it.
#821$#As an idol, Muse needs to be very strict in weight management.|
99117|#821$#Cooking? Muse has always wanted to learn how to cook for master.
#824$#But... Muse spends lots of time just recording albums and practicing new dances...|
99116|Christmas feast?|
99115|#821$#Of course it's a Christmas tour!
#821$#Muse will perform everywhere in the world! Muse can't wait!|
99114|#821$#As an idol,
#823$#Christmas also belongs to Muse's fans!
#823$#Please look forward to Muse's Christmas special!|
99113|Christmas plans?|
99112|#821$#Drink more and stop thinking about it!|
99111|#822$#Hmmph! It won't be your call to end the relationship between us.|
99110|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
99109|#821$#Those are things that happened before I got to know Amaterasu!
#821$#I'm no longer the same as before!|
99108|#821$#It must have been No. 1 who told you...
#822$#You must keep this secret of mine! Amaterasu can never know!|
99107|I heard you courted many women before this.|
99106|#821$#Don't you think that Amaterasu's mouth twitches.. are really cute?!
#821$#Nonsense! I'm not a freak!|
99105|#821$#Of course! She's my wife!
#824$#She doesn't admit it... because she's shy!|
99104|Do you like Amaterasu?|
99103|#821$#This! Is the brightest!
#821$#Can't you tell?
#821$#What's taking you so long to differentiate them?|
99102|#823$#The one with the shiniest scales is No. 1.
#823$#The one with the smoothest body is No. 2.
#823$#The one with the sharpest fangs is No. 3.
#823$#Finally, the smallest one is No. 4.|
99101|Who's No. 1?|
99100|#822$#Hey... You can see there's a problem just by looking at it.
#821$#Don't you think... we look like a match in heaven?|
99099|#821$#Of course we're husband and wife! Doesn't everyone know that?
#821$#My nemesis? Who's saying such things? I'm not gonna go easy on them...
#821$#Amaterasu said that? Impossible! She'll never say that!|
99098|Who is Amaterasu to you?|
99097|#822$#Why do people always say that Kusanagi looks similar to Kaiser Zeta?
#821$#Is that idiot trying to match his outfit with my daughter?
#824$#I would never allow such absurd behavior! He's not worthy of my perfect daughter!|
99096|#821$#That Muramasa fella... has many good traits.
#821$#Looks like he'll be a good drinking buddy!|
99095|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
99094|#821$#Kusanagi is the essence of my love with Amaterasu!
#821$#Her veins flow with my blood! She's my pride!|
99093|#821$#Of course we are father and daughter! There's no question about it!
#824$#I have dedicated my blood and flesh to nurture this lovely little being!|
99092|What is your relationship with Kusanagi?|
99091|#822$#Hmm... Did you know that the grape juice has important benefits for the health?|
99090|#821$#Don't be silly,
#821$#what do you think?|
99089|Do you like sweet drinks?|
99088|#822$#Ever since I found out that Amaterasu doesn't like it,
#821$#I gave it up.|
99087|#824$#...When I was young.
#824$#Don't look at me like that! Have you never made any mistakes since you were a child?|
99086|Do you eat people?|
99085|#822$#Where did you see that I have eight heads...
#821$#Wake up! And stop stealing my private stash!|
99084|#822$#Hmm? Are you drunk?|
99083|You have eight heads and eight tails?|
99082|#822$#Did you notice that near the Culinary Club...
#821$#There's a Pink Lamb?
#823$#Go get that lamb...Fresh lamb with grape juice is the best!|
99081|#822$#It's a place where humans cook, right?
#823$#It's strange... Why is there only a restaurant association but not a one for a grape juice-passionates?|
99080|What can you tell me about the Culinary Club?|
99079|#822$#Write a letter? No. 2 will deal with this kind of things.
#823$#My time is really precious, you know!|
99078|#821$#I can't be bothered with such things!|
99077|Why don't you write a letter?|
99076|#821$#Why do you need the Eternal Codex to remember when you're so young?
#822$#I can still remember the first time I saw Amaterasu...|
99075|#822$#I think No. 1 mentioned it before... It's a book that records memories.
#822$#You're still so young! Don't rely on such things!
#821$#Remember what you've experienced yourself!|
99074|Eternal Codex.|
99073|#821$#I've heard of an organiztion called Mirabelle.
#821$#If you're looking for a quest, you should over and take a look.
#821$#I...I'll wait here while I drink grape juice!|
99072|#822$#Hmm... Let me think about it...
#821$#Let me have a drink...and then lie down...
#821$#And... think... (snores)...|
99071|Tell me about the Quests.|
99070|#822$#Hmm... Well...
#821$#Do you know where Amaterasu usually shows up?|
99069|#821$#Sarpa's Forbidden Laboratory,
#822$#...Why are you looking at me like that?
#823$#There's nothing wrong if I want to go against other snakes!|
99068|Is there somewhere I'd like to go?|
99067|#821$#What about you? What do you think of me?|
99066|#821$#...I've lived for a thousand years.
#821$#In my eyes, you're just a baby.|
99065|What is your impression of me?|
99064|#823$#In my eyes... There isn't any I consider a formidable opponent...
#821$#What? You think I'll lose to my wife?
#821$#...But I can't hit my wife... and I'll never break this principle of mine!|
99063|#821$#Be bold! A man must have a strong fighting spirit!|
99062|How to deal with a powerful enemy.|
99061|#822$#Grape juice! Do you still need to ask?|
99060|#822$#I'm not picky.
#821$#I care more about freshness compared to variety.
#821$#Fresh flesh and blood is just the perfect side dish!|
99059|What do I like to eat?|
99058|#822$#Hmm... I guess it would be Amaterasu...
#821$#After all, she's also my child's mother...
#824$#What kind of expression is that?|
99057|#821$#Of course it would be my beloved daughter, Kusanagi!
#821$#...Hold on, I guess you would be someone I care about too.|
99056|Who do you care about?|
99055|#821$#Come here! Allow me to let you experience the answer for yourself!
#821$#Here you go! Cheers!|
99054|#821$#Haha! Do I really need to say it?
#823$#Of course I'll find a place to spend the whole day drinking grape juice!|
99053|What do you do to kill time?|
96234|#821$#...My heart is alive again.

326|Auctioning
Head to the Auction House to find just what you need for your journey, or sell items you don't need to interested buyers!

Buying
After clicking on an item you want, press "Purchase" to pay for it and complete the transaction.

Selling
For each item sold, 10% will be deducted from your profits as the listing fee. All currently-auctioned items are displayed at the bottom-left.

Setting the Auction
Drag the item that you'd like to sell to the Auction column, enter the selling price, select a store to join, and pay the listing fee to complete the process. Items will be displayed for 24 hours - if the item is not sold during this time, it will be de-listed and returned to you via mail.

Compare Prices
When you click on an item and select "Start Price Compare," all of that item currently listed in the Auction House will be displayed in the right-hand column, along with their prices.

Canceling an Auction
If an item you have listed hasn't yet sold, you can select it at any time and click "Cancel Auction" to de-list the item, which will be returned to you via mail. Canceling an auction will not refund the item's listing fee.|
327|Anti-Bot Test
From time to time, you may see a window pop up giving you three tries to enter a code. When the code is successfully entered, you will gain a helpful 10-minute buff that increases your XP by 10% and restores your spiritual power. However, if you fail to enter the code correctly, you'll receive a 10-minute debuff that reduces your HP to 1% and sends you back to your most recent Waypoint.|

When your character's HP reaches 0, they will die. Not to worry, though - there are three ways to bring them back to fight another day!

Local Revival: Revive at the starting Waypoint of the area, out of harm's way.

Waypoint Revival: Revive at the Waypoint you most recently set.

On-the-Spot Revival: If you have a reviving item in your inventory, you can come back right on the spot where you died.

Tip: Talk with the Shield of Virtue medical officers stationed across the land to record new revival points.|

4042|First on the battlefield and the last to leave, Guardians work tirelessly to ensure victory through superior tactics. Their sword and shield combo gives them a balanced offense and defense, enabling them to outlast enemies while waiting for the perfect opening - or to create one with a well-timed block and counterattack.|
4043|Consummate masters of support, Bards know a song for every situation. Always a hit in parties, their sonic skills are enough to see them through a solo performance. With harp in hand, they can unleash songs to harm, heal, or help, ensuring they'll always be called on for an encore.|
4044|The ways of magic are mysterious to many, but Wizards see order amidst the chaos, looking to the forces of nature for their inspiration. Using staves to focus raw mana, they conjure elemental spells that can turn the tides of battle, making them respected and indispensable allies in combat.|
4045|Each swing of a Ravager's massive axe delivers a payload of pain, and often collateral damage to any unfortunate enough to be standing too close. With fury burning in their eyes, they will shrug off their own injuries and destroy anything that stands in their way.|

5476|Dear Envoy of Gaia,

Since now you've grown a bit and are ready to create your own party, it's time to find some partners and share adventure together! You can choose a Guild you like, join them and enjoy the experience. You may also use a Portal to be teleported to Navea to talk to Babama, and ask him how to build up your own Guild and recruit new members.|
5477|Dear Envoy of Gaia,

You've grown greater now, and understand how to call upon the Power of Gaia. When you can't fight enemies on your own, you can use the Team Up Interface to fight alongside a group of other Envoys of Gaia.

Or, you may use a Portal to be teleported to the Stall Area in Navea to Set Up a Stall so you can trade with other Envoys of Gaia and strengthen yourself with better weapons.|
5478|Dear Envoy of Gaia,

You are now an experienced adventurer. Keep up the pace, and explore this unknown world. When you reach Level 40, you will select and learn how to use a second weapon. You will be able to use the Refining system to enhance your own Weapons and Armor.|

5611|Brawlers live for the thrill of close-range combat, their wrist-mounted blades turning their arms into deadly weapons. With superhuman reactivity, they pile on heavy combos to lock down enemies. Darting and weaving in and out of the fight, Brawlers will carve up any foe who can't keep up blow for blow.|
5612|Preferring ancient elegance to the latest technology, Rangers turn to the bow, a noble, time-tested weapon as deadly as it was in ages past. With their long-range assaults, Rangers can drop many foes before they get a chance to attack. The arrows they fire are not only as damaging as any blade, but a fine vehicle for enchantments as well.|
5613|After the flash of the blade, all that remains are cherry blossoms in the air and slain enemies on the ground.

A Ronin uses unparalleled blade skills and intense observation to destroy enemies in a flash by striking their weaknesses.
The unique skill of the Ronin drains the souls of enemies and collects them in the blade. Souls stored in the Tachi can be released in battle, destroying all that stands in their way.
|
5614|The grim reaper of the underworld has appeared. Wherever he goes, death follows.

He who wields the scythe marshals unrivaled destructive power and ferocious attack speed. When the blade falls, heads will roll.
He signs contracts with minor devils, and summons them in battle. He is also versed in various kinds of powerful magic, which he uses to inflict heavy damage on the enemy.|

6237|Party %s1 : %s2|
6238|Death and rebirth exist together

in every battle and every kill.

In the haze of dust and the stench of blood,
you find that balance of life and death in the perfect kill.|
6239|Shadow Assassin

Death waits with baited breath, yearning for a purpose.

Dressed to kill and armed for the slaughter,
she waits for an unsuspecting victim to stumble onto her trap.|
6240|Divine Shield

This shield bears my power and is witness to my glory.

More than just a weapon, it is an extension of myself and my beliefs.
Every mark on my shield represents my sacrifice, my resolve, and my sworn duty.|
6241|Storm Warrior

Evil knows no mercy beneath the clash of thunder and lightning's deadly pierce,

yet evil still spreads like a plague, dragging with it great sorrow.
Emboldened with the might of a thunder god, I am what stands in the way of complete despair.|
6242|The Slow Burn

My rage fuels my power

and my killer instincts are ablaze;
nothing can stop me now.
|
6243|Hand of Vengeance

Seize control, take up your might,

and realize that the beauty of brutality
is that even the most powerful will someday fall.
|
6244|Sun Mage

Light is the spark of all living things.

It has sustained civilizations and shielded the world from everlasting darkness.
It is the source of unparalleled power.
So I say, "Let there be light."|
6245|Elemental Archmage

Elements emerge and disappear,

but they never fade away.
To master this temporal magic is to master an ancient, everlasting power.|
6246|Maverick

Adrift at the edge of the law, on the precipice of life and death,

The fate of my world is like a bullet tearing through the confines of fate.
Your life is in my hands.|
6247|Strategist

There is a certain rhythm to combat,

like a dancer torn between the conflicting beats of emotion and reason.
One is often oblivious to their own demise even while stumbling upon it.|
6248|Destructive Cannon

Just because something is torn asunder does not mean it cannot return back to the way it was.

The most destructive of weapons can also put an end to the most damaging disputes, welcoming peace for a little while.
The cannon roars.|
6249|I-ARMY

An ancient civilization wields advanced technology.

A lost civilization with the key to new wonders has been found.
Meshing together high-tech innovation and ruthless battle strategy,
I-ARMY is prepared to work for YOU towards the path to victory!|
6250|Fiendish Envoy

The purest energy resides in the soul,

within the depths of emotion and the pulse of reason.
Those who unlock the mystery behind the souls holds the power to control these fiends.|
6251|Star Walker

Let me shed this old life from an old world

and walk upon this new world full of wisdom and wonder.
There is nothing I cannot accomplish.|
6252|Phoenix Song

The phoenix, reborn, rises from the ashes of its regrets.

Use the harp to imitate the haunting call of the phoenix and obtain Warm Mist.
Use this to help those in need.|
6253|Temple Bard

Holy light shines upon those

who wield a strong, divine melody.
All regrets are purified to the tune.|
6254|Preacher of Hard Knocks

Worship is done through the fists.

Prayer is done through the perfect swing of a punch.
The battlefield is my church!|
6255|Simmering Emperor

Those who fall before me only build upon the pathway to my success.

I do not remember when I started this journey,
but no one can stop me from finishing it.|
6256|Demonic Wing Scythe

I can hear the taught bow string tremble as I release the arrow.

This is what steadies my focus in combat.
The moment my fingers slip from the bow string, I am at peace, and the very air trembles in fear.|
6257|Frozen Archer

These odd crystals reflect light in a deadly array.

Most do not understand what they see,
and I will use this to my advantage.|
6258|Swift Kaiten Style

My fighting style surges from within me

to produce lightning-quick slashes.
The blade is so fast, it is nearly invisible.
Most enemies do not see it coming.|
6259|Fierce Flash Style

You will hear my blade before you see it, but by then it is too late.

Killing two birds with one stone is my motto.
With speed and precision, all are at the mercy of my blade.|
6260|Nether Realm Acolyte

In the Nether Realm, souls are chained to their torment.

There is no escape, no unity, no identity.
This is true misery.|
6261|Master of Curses

Sticks and stones may break my bones,

but words will definitely kill me.
If pronounced in the correct way, these words can produce power beyond imagining.|

6284|In the name of all that is holy, I spread all my glory, and wield my sword to judge all sins in the mortal world.

Those who hold the Holy Sword should have strong convictions and a brave heart, and be able to show righteousness through sword fighting.
They can transform their faith into Divine Energy in battle, and use the Holy Sword to punish all evil hindering their beliefs.|
6285|Shinobi are an ancient and mysterious group that live between the light and shadows. When good and evil are aligned, they will reappear to claim their rightful inheritance.

When you attack with a shuriken, there is a chance of summoning the shadow warrior, who will aid you in battle. Shinobi will accumulate chakras over time.
Accumulate enough chakras, and you can cast an arcane spell. When you cast a spell, the Shadow Warrior will also use his skills to assist you in battle, dealing massive damage to your enemies.|
6286|A tremendous power sleeps within the Lance's mark. It is capable of harnessing the elemental powers of fire, ice, lightning, and darkness. Once awakened, these ancient powers will suppress all those who stand against the wielder.

Whenever a skill is used, you will earn a Mark of Flame or Mark of Ice, depending on the type of skill. Once three marks are bestowed upin the sealed tablet, the true terrible power of the lance can be unleashed in the form of ultimate moves.

6287|Each Guitar skill played will be accompanied by three different musical notes in Fresh Blue, Bright Golden, and Dazzling Purple. Play the notes in a certain order to form a special melody and liberate its soul in the form of a skill. The ultimate skill is "Universal Chord."

"Universal Chord" unlocks the full potential of the Guitar, granting powerful damage to enemies and bolstering your allies' strength.|
6288|The members of the Lavender Tribe are descendants of angels and humans. They are bound by blood. Women's appearance remain at the stage of a little girl and cannot grow. But like humans, some people from the tribe also have the Power of Gaia.

With its innate limitations, the Lavender Tribe has developed a set of special fighting techniques. They can control Draco-Puppets and turn them into battle hammers and heavy cannons to fight. They can gather energy during the battle. When the energy reaches the maximum value, they can cast a spell that will temporarily remove the restrictions and release an angelic power that is powerful enough to move the world.|

7801|Dark Lance Skills

That which comes first is often the strongest. There is no denying the strength of those that have defied the ages.

This ancient dark lance is a relic from a long-banned form of lancecraft.
Proficiency with dark energy can choke the sprouting seed of life.
Summon an infernal black flame to burn away everything before you.|
7802|God of Lightning's Lancecraft

Even holy warriors cannot hope to best the incredible strength contained within Lightning Lances.

This is a legendary form of lancecraft handed down by the God of Lightning.
Lances crafted with this technique are especially useful in lightning raids. They are also able to harness the frost hanging in the air to freeze enemies.
The speed and force with which these lances impact their foes make them impossible to parry.|

20035|The guard saw your "treasure" from a distance, and kept staring at it.|
20036|Faint cries seem to come from the guard ahead.|
20037|The Guard gave a casual look and yawned.|
20038|You saw a few bats flying to your side and starting to attack the Wolfmen.|
20039|More bats fly to your vicinity, and attack Wolfmen whenever they see them.|
20040|The bats hover near the camp fire, looking a bit frenzied.|
20041|You show Adjutant Bluto the treasure from the cart.|
20042|Now that they're distracted, I have to get out of here as quickly as I can.|
20043|No! Don't you come near me!!!|
20044|My dear, don't be shy! We gotta face up to ourselves!|
20045|The point is the woman I love is... Your sister!|
20046|What? I don't have any sisters, only a brother!|
20047|You can't just barge in here! Get out!|
20048|You can't come upstairs. If you know what's good for you, you'll get out of here right now!|
20049|Give me your treasure!|
20050|With this much money, I don't have to be a pirate anymore! I can retire in comfort!|
20051|How dare you poach treasure in another pirate's territory? You're begging for death!|
20052|Treasure! I want real treasure!|
20053|You haven't picked up the Stolen Ceremonial Tome. Do you have enough space in your backpack?|
20054|Those corpses... They're dead guards. It looks like Brian was here.|
20055|No! You're also here to save this little devil, so you'll come to a sorry end like them!|
20056|After the gatekeeper fell, an entrance opened up in front of the hall's demon sculpture, leading deep within.|
20057|The scenery here is even stranger, as the deep part of this Great Land has been ruined.|
20058|Come ride on my Ostrich Cart, I'll show you the famous attractions of Navea!|
20059|You hear the sounds of footsteps, accompanied by the voices of the Village Chief and his wife.|
20060|Joel!|
20061|Suddenly, an immense pressure fell over the place, too strong to ignore.|
20062|The Shadow Knight's voice echoes throughout the hall.|
20063|Shadow Knight: "It's time to end this farce!"|
20064|Fire sprayed from the Shadow Knight's sword, killing everyone nearby.|
20065|Andre will stop these Demon Spiderlings. Go on to the next Commander.|
20066|Such strength! I never stood a chance.|
20067|How can I possibly face someone so powerful?|
20068|Was this just a dream... or a vision of things to come?|
20069|Available Number|
20070|Available Number|
20071|Available Number|
20072|The Mountain Path entrance is in front of the ruins.|
20073|You applied ointment to the three injured collectors.|
20074|East Arena Passage|
20075|East City Ruins Teleporter|
20076|Southern Main Bridge|
20077|You've placed three water purifiers.|

20079|You found that Water Purifier No.3 is not where it used to be!|

20088|Great! Sorry for letting everyone wait for so long. I shall now announce the start of the Robot Competition!|
20089|What happened?|
20090|Competition begins! Alain shouted.|
20091|This competition was really worth watching! The winner is Augustus Mk. VII!|
20092|Coming up next is an absolutely thrilling match for everyone. Let's welcome the Rock Warrior!|
20093|I'm so dizzy...|
20094|Northeast of Timbria Forest|
20095|How could it have come to this...|
20096|The competition is getting really exciting. Let's go on to the next one!|
20097|Ladies and Gentlemen, coming up next is Iron Dragon! His opponent better look out, Iron Dragon is well-known for piling attack on attack!|
20098|Will I become like him, in the end?|
20099|Let's map this place first...|
20100|Almost done mapping the rough terrain around Catseye Lair...|
20101|Finally finished drawing the map. Now let's take it back to Luther.|
20102|Cough... I declare Augustus Mk. VII qualified for final match!|
20103|Alright! Here comes the moment, let's have a round of applause for all our competitors.|
20104|The whole audience kept cheering for Montero.|
20105|Selena can't be here... All I see are pirates!|
20106|As I am the Brevis Chief as well as the organizer of the competition, I declare the final match starts... now!|
20107|This is really an unbelievable competition. It seems...|
20108|Uh... Well, looks like this game is already over. This time the winner is Augustus...|
20109|Don't push!|
20110|The elders of a family are precious, their wisdom and experience is a treasure. Please treat them with more respect.|
20111|After putting down the large urn, you quickly hid yourself to one side.|
20112|A trio of patrolmen pass by.|
20113|Hmm? How come there's a large urn here?|
20114|Tribal Patrolmen try to push the urn away.|
20115|Feels quite heavy. Don't know what's inside it.|
20116|I got it! This must be the wine that someone stole from Lunarin Village!|
20117|Great! With this much wine, we can hold ceremonies for several days!|
20118|Let's move this urn to the warehouse quickly!|
20119|Three Tribal Patrolmen lifted the urn up, and carried it to the inside of their camp.|
20120|Great, Thanks a lot.|
20121|Now that all the Ceremonial Vessels have been found, we should get out of here quickly.|
20122|Robot Guards have found you! They immediately raise the alarm!|
20123|Glowing Robot: WARNING! WARNING! Invasion of unidentified object!|
20124|Oops! I'm caught. I have to find shelter first.|
20125|North of the Farm|
20126|You will enter into the Witch's memory, and experience her past just as she did.|
20127|In her memories, you see that the Witch cast "Summon Meteor"(a powerful range attack) and "Earth Frost" (a straight-line Immobilized attack) most often.|
20128|Several enemies have appeared, and they're closing in. Quickly, repel them with magic!|
20129|Enough! All of you, get out!|
20130|Things suddenly went dark. You don't know what happened.|
20131|You heard a faint conversation.|
20132|Darkness again...|
20133|This time you are not surprised, and silently observe the change in your surroundings.|
20134|Hazel's voice rang out, but not from the witch in front of you.|
20135|Hazel: "Ok... You've seen enough. Now go back."|
20136|You can already guess what will happen.|
20137|Again... complete darkness...|
20138|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Great, see if there are other Wolfman Marks around.|
20139|Capture Sprites|

20147|Capture the Demarech Mines Foreman|
20148|The ceremony is about to begin. The crowd begins to move closer to the altar.|
20149|Before the ceremony starts, we must first thank this hero.|
20150|Thanks to this Envoy's help, the preparations for the ceremony went smoothly this year.|
20151|Applause breaks out all around.|
20152|Please place the Crescent Gems on the altar.|
20153|Once you put the gems on it, the altar starts to emit brilliant lights.|
20154|Villagers standing around begin to sing and dance excitedly.|
20155|The village chief then takes a box from under the altar.|
20156|This is the key that has been passed down from one generation to the next in the village. Now I will use this key to open the Starlight Treasure Chest.|
20157|You enjoy the ceremony first, and look for me in the village afterwards.|
20158|After saying that, the Village Chief takes the box and walks back to the village.|
20159|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Follow my command, move forward to the red arrow.|
20160|I didn't expect pirates patrolling the shore... Looks like things won't be that easy...|
20161|Must figure out how to avoid these parrots...|
20162|This is the planned site for the southern section trap. Great, set it up quickly.|
20163|Here's the middle section...  Pirates are patrolling here... Gotta keep my voice down.|
20164|Finally reached the last site... What a rough day. Let's finish this.|

20176|Sarpa Abyss|
20177|After you have piled Aquatic Plants up on the ground, a huge turtle approached from a distance.|
20178|When you opened the bag filled with bats, they poured out and flew quickly toward the camp.|
20179|After using the scanner, the machine produced a page of numbers.|
20180|We have gained a powerful force from the spring water. You, frail human, cannot defeat us!|
20181|When you arrive at the designated location, soldiers begin to gather.|
20182|Is everyone ready? Let's show these Sarpa who's boss!|
20183|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Quick! Attack these Wolfmen!|
20184|Mia's command rang out in your mind: You've completed the mission, now head for the campfire!|
20185|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Keep patrolling, There are many targets still to be eliminated.|
20186|Mia's command rang out in your mind: Where are you going? Move to the left of the camp!|

20210|Statue Ruins|
20211|Timbria Forest|
20212|Hushglen Hollow|
20213|Logging Site|
20214|Hidden Cave|
20215|What kind of situation is this?|
20216|Well... Are you being too happy or...?|
20217|Wow! Are you okay? What happened?|
20218|Hmm? A wood pile ashore. It might be useful.|
20219|Ah... They've seen us. Let's retreat to a safe place. Staying alive is the most important task.|
20220|Vhell says, "Outsiders, leave immediately or pay the price!"|
20221|Vhell says, "Since you wanted in so badly, I won't let you out..."|
20222|Under the blockade of East City Ruins, you have to use "East City Mountain Pass Teleporter" beside "Collector Akers" to enter or exit there.|
20223|You have knocked out the Double Leaf Sprout. Quickly, put it in your cloth bag!|
20224|Altar of the Moon|
20225|East of Navea|
20226|Outside the Alabastren Temple|
20227|Center of New Moon Hunting Grounds|
20228|North of New Moon Hunting Grounds|
20229|You found a suspicious mound near the spot marked on the map. Do you want to dig it up?|
20230|There seems to be a commotion not far from here. Go take a look!|
20231|Bring the treasure chest from the Pit Beetle to Isaias to have it opened.|
20232|Isaias: I am quite sure there is a treasure map buried somewhere nearby. Come and help me dig it out!|
20233|Stone Hammer Tribe|
20234|Don't underestimate what these bugs can do. It is horrifying and devastating when they swarm.|
20235|Isaias: Let's put the torn pieces of the treasure map together and see where the treasure is buried.|
20236|I see more and more beetles. Gotta be careful.|
20237|Show Isaias the treasure map.|
20238|When you begin to search, a pirate suddenly jumps out!|
20239|Donny released his own beetle. The two beetles locked mandibles in a face-off.|
20240|Go for it, little boy! Show them what being a champion is all about!|
20241|Donny's beetle slowly moved forward.|
20242|Donny's beetle stopped moving. Looks like it's about to die.|
20243|You won this Beetle Battle.|
20244|My boy! You can't die! My boy!!|
20245|The sneaky villagers suddenly rush out from behind!|
20246|This... This feeling is...|
20247|A golden light shone from the alchemist's body.|
20248|Really delicious!!!|
20249|The witch, after muttering a spell, became shrouded in a black fog!|
20250|When you started the seismometer, the device made a buzzing.|
20251|The machine has finished its measurement. Now move on to the next place.|
20252|Measurement in all locations have been completed. Now, quickly, take the seismometer back to the Craftsman.|
20253|Ralph picked up the trumpet shell and blew it, hard. The sound was very loud.|
20254|Children appeared, obviously attracted by the sound of the trumpet shell.|
20255|Who blew the trumpet shell?|
20256|What happened?|
20257|Be quiet! I'm now the boss of the Helonia Pirates!|
20258|Can I blow the shell if I join?|
20259|Any yummy things to eat?|
20260|The very first thing we need to do is build our own pirate ship. You go to the shore and gather wood!|
20261|I still have other things to do. Gotta be going.|
20262|I'm so hungry. Need to go home and eat something.|
20263|After saying that, the kids left.|
20264|NO! Even if I am the only one here, I still can be the Pirate King! Right?|
20265|The hunter took the parrot out.|
20266|I think I'll name you... Bobby!|
20267|I'm talking about your name, not mine.|
20268|Stop talking! Shut up!|
20269|Perry is so fed up with the noisy parrot that he sets it free just to be rid of it.|
20270|Next time, I want a quieter pet.|
20271|I want to do this like it says in this book, as soon as possible.|
20272|First, apply the green juice sparingly on the face. Then put the feather in the hair...|
20273|Done! Let me see how it looks!|
20274|Why it looks like this! Don't tell me that this is the Gnome's makeup book!|
20275|Sue hurriedly removes the makeup from her face.|
20276|After saying that, Paolo starts assembling the components.|
20277|Done. It's a piece of cake to manufacture the Gnomes' stuff.|
20278|I have made some improvements. This robot is definitely more powerful than any the Gnomes have manufactured.|
20279|That's not my technical problem... The Gnome's materials are not good enough. Right! That's the reason!|
20280|The seed, once buried in soil, soon bloomed into a flower.|
20281|Unexpectedly... A brutal Beetle just appeared under the flower!|
20282|After you have used the slate, a translucent spirit appears in front of you.|
20283|When you see this message, I will be gone.|
20284|But remember that this temple has something really terrible sealed inside it.|
20285|No matter what happens, you have to protect this place. Don't let the seal be broken.|
20286|If you fail, a terrible calamity will be unleashed upon the land.|
20287|After saying that, the spirit slowly disappeared.|
20288|First make sure if this is the kind of thing it likes to eat.|
20289|The Birdbrain happily devoured the feed.|
20290|The Birdbrain continues to ask Clark for food.|
20291|You really eat a lot. This should be enough for you.|
20292|The Birdbrain ate the feed too quickly again.|
20293|No way! If you eat it all again, I'll lose money.|
20294|With nothing to eat around, the Birdbrain got angry and ran away.|
20295|Next time, I'll have to find an animal that doesn't eat this much...|
20296|Let's leave this village first. I must have lost my baby outside.|
20297|Last time I was outside the village, I went to the pool in the east. Let's go there and take a look around.|
20298|I can feel it. My baby must be around the pool in the south.|
20299|Suddenly a small Jerboa came out of a nearby crevice.|
20300|Great, my baby is safe!|
20301|Thank you for helping me find my baby. I'd like to give you this, in gratitude.|
20302|Gruff put down a small box on the ground.|
20303|I picked this up from the riverside. I have no idea how to use this. Please just take it.|
20304|You put the flower basket on the altar, and a sprite came out from behind the altar.|
20305|I'm the spirit of the forest. Thank you for your dedication. I will bless you for a good harvest this year.|
20306|Wait, wait, how come there's nothing to eat inside?|
20307|Darn it! You cannot send me off with only these flowers!|
20308|The inferno devoured bats, and blocked your sight...|
20309|Looks like something is moving inside the middle of the mound.|
20310|You feel something is happening to the Crystal Ore.|
20311|Furious, the Magical Oreling abandons its Crystal Ore disguise and stands up.|
20312|Bartley: Don't worry! I'm here to help you!|
20313|Something's going on out front. Go see what it's all about.|
20314|An old voice: Oh my... can somebody come and help me...|
20315|There's noise up front. Head up and see what's going on.|
20316|The sounds of intense fighting come from the front. Go see what happened.|
20317|A horrifying scream came from up front. Go and see what happened.|
20318|Be careful, flames are all around. Don't get burnt.|
20319|It seems someone has triggered the pirates' defense system. Pirate Defense Robots have appeared!|
20320|Watch out! It's a pirate ambush! Fight back and be careful.|
20321|Grass Kingdom's warriors have joined the battle!|
20322|When Guard GT-630 was destroyed, the rest of the pirates ran away.|
20323|Don't underestimate me, you fool! I'm a warrior from Grass Kingdom.|
20324|The warrior Zinnia attacked with savage strength! The pirates' underlings suffered terrible damage, and ran away.|
20325|The mechanical guard of Catseye was hit with intense electricity. Its shield doesn't work!|
20326|The mechanical guard of Catseye was destroyed! I can't stay here for too long, the alarm was triggered.|
20327|Seems like the Sprout needs a temporarily break... better just keep on going.|
20328|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Woodbeast|
20329|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Rock Warrior|
20330|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Iron Dragon|
20331|Augustus Mk. VII vs. Defending Champion Montero|
20332|Abel: Help! I don't want to die!|
20333|The sounds of intense fighting can be heard around the corner.|
20334|Yeshe: Ouch, I think I pulled my groin! Just...just go on ahead without me.|
20335|Rehia seems to need a good rest.|
20336|You see Zinnia up ahead, assaulted by the pirates.|
20337|Ahead should be the consignor. Confirm with her and see if she needs any help.|
20338|This big, ancient tree radiates a mysterious aura.|
20339|You seem to have blacked out after a strong electrical shock.|
20340|A resounding noise rises from the depths of the Cave (190,150), lingering for a few moments.|
20341|Dustin: Wait a minute. I would like to finish digging out this mine.|
20342|When you wake up, you feel that a mysterious power teleported you to the big tree.|
20343|South of the farm|
20344|West of the farm|
20345|Captured Mistwalker Chief|
20346|Sprayed pesticide around the farm.|
20347|Please follow Meira and complete all the quests needed to let her acquire the Flower Crown Blessed by Sprites.|
20348|The sounds of an argument can be heard from around the corner.|
20349|Now that I'm in here, I have to find the stolen Ceremonial Vessel.|
20350|Halton: Now that I'm in here, I have to find the stolen Ceremonial Vessel.|
20351|I can get to the center of the Settlement if I walk along the road.|
20352|Halton: I can get to the center of the Settlement if I walk along the road.|
20353|This Electroreceptor will help me find those Ceremonial Vessels.|
20354|Halton: This Electroreceptor will help me find those Ceremonial Vessels.|
20355|Gotta avoid the Robots otherwise we'll have to retreat temporarily.|
20356|Halton: Gotta avoid the Robots otherwise we'll have to retreat temporarily.|
20357|The Electroreceptor indicates that the Ceremonial Vessel is somewhere nearby.|
20358|Halton: The Electroreceptor indicates that the Ceremonial Vessel is somewhere nearby.|
20359|The Electroreceptor has stopped again. I have to search around it.|
20360|Halton: The Electroreceptor has stopped again. I have to search around it.|
20361|The Electroreceptor has stopped at the corner. Maybe that's where the Stolen Ceremonial Tome is located.|
20362|Halton: The Electroreceptor has stopped at the corner. Maybe that's where the Stolen Ceremonial Tome is located.|
20363|This feature guides the Electroreceptor towards the exit you set, just follow it.|
20364|Halton: This feature guides the Electroreceptor towards the exit you set, just follow it.|
20365|The Electroreceptor looks a bit unstable... Is it running out of power?|
20366|Halton: The Electroreceptor looks a bit unstable... Is it running out of power?|
20367|Ah... The power has run out. Thank you so much for today.|
20368|Halton: Ah...The power has run out. Thank you so much for today.|
20369|Connecting Electroreceptor...|
20370|Connection succeeded. It's about to teleport.|
20371|A strange laughing came out...|
20372|Palmgil Oasis|
20373|Cracked Sand Plain|
20374|Sand Owl Camp|
20375|Dune Outpost|
20376|Cactus Plateau|

20378|Dwelling of Rex|
20379|Dwelling of Curly-Tailed Chameleon|
20380|Stronghold of Sand Owl Bandits|
20381|The Crystal Mine is filled with the smell of blood...|
20382|The ghosts of many miners manifest before you.|
20383|These miners... Don't tell me that they were all killed by John!|
20384|The area was thick with sadness.|
20385|You feel dizzy. It seems that there's a power drawing you.|
20386|You can tell from all the commotion that a dangerous enemy is nearby.|
20387|The Electroreceptor is still moving, but unable to teleport.|
20388|Great! All the Stolen Ceremonial Vessels were discovered. Now only the Stolen Ceremonial Tome is left to do.|
20389|The ghost miners started to attack you from all directions.|
20390|The Demon destroyed John's heart and soul, reborn completely.|
20391|Uh...ah!!!|
20392|John: Gosh! This...This brilliant light, could it be the legendary "Heart of the Demon?"|
20393|John: If I sold it under the table, I could...|
20394|Crrck! Crrck! Crrck! The constant sounds of digging in the mine almost drowned out the shaky cry...|
20395|Johnny shouts, "Ah!!!"|
20396|It seems that you haven't checked the previous batch of Crystal Ore.|
20397|This...This word... Anyways, let's move forward quickly.|
20398|The light of the Crystal Ore reveals the past.|
20399|Oh... You were almost captured. You should be more careful this time.|
20400|Johnny: John, take a look. This is my son, when he was one month old. He looks really like me!|
20401|Johnny: After he grows up, he will become a... Wait, what are you doing...|
20402|Josey: Oh, John, look at this. Isn't this shining, brilliant crystal diamond ring beautiful?|
20403|Josey: This used up all the money that I've secretly stashed away over the years. It wasn't easy, but I finally managed to buy this!|
20404|Josey: Haha, how happy do you think my woman will be if I sent it to her? huh! You! Ahhhh!!!|
20405|It seems that happy promise is still ringing in your memory...|
20406|The blood stains are still on the ground.|
20407|Who? Who is there?|
20408|Go ambush the dozing Guard on the right, then change into his clothes and get past the next checkpoint!|
20409|The low growls of wild wolves can be heard ahead. Be careful, don't let yourself be seen!|
20410|Not sure where that midget is, he just passed here a while ago!|
20411|Ouch... Who hit me... Uhhh....|
20412|Sorry. I'm just gonna borrow your clothes for a while!|
20413|John: Wait for me... I'm sure I'll have enough money to have you cured...|
20414|John: This time there will surely be enough money...|
20415|John: After that, we'll be able to live happily.|
20416|Heart of the Demon - a gem formed in the corpse of a fallen Demon, possessed of an unmatched brilliance, at least according to legend.|
20417|Its beauty conceals the fact that its owner will be cursed. Its price is incredibly high.|
20418|John: After you are healed... We'll live happily ever after...|
20419|Bandage the injured Hunter|
20420|Your crops are suffering pest damage.|
20421|Explore the crystal mine step by step.|
20422|Push the cart to Akara.|
20423|The Stolen Ceremonial Tome is found. However, I still need to find the complete set of Ceremonial Vessels.|
20424|I found the stolen Tome and Vessels. Now I can go meet the foreman.|
20425|Kakkan's screaming made you feel there's no way to get in there and pick up Flower of Life.|
20426|First, you need to find a way to knock him out.|
20427|Ida quickly opened the letter and read it.|
20428|Will Caine come back and marry me, once the quest is over?|
20429|Gosh! Mei's boyfriend said those words, last time, but he never came back!|
20430|I have to go to church and pray for his safety as soon as possible.|
20431|Elena put the materials into the pot, and muttered the spell.|
20432|Dear Sprite of the Land, 
Please send your blessing to this warrior,
Keep him safe in this invasion of demons.|
20433|After Elena finished the ritual, you felt some special power surrounding you.|
20434|OK, so you are now under the fairy's protection. It will reduce the damage caused by monsters near you.|
20435|Millia took a carrot out to feed Bunnyhop.|
20436|The Bunnyhop excitedly bounced around Millia.|
20437|You came here to fish too?|
20438|Hey boy, don't think of fishing as something simple.|
20439|Without skill and patience, you won't catch anything all day.|
20440|See, a fish has hooked.|
20441|I have practice. Kiddo, you still have a lot to learn.|
20442|That must be a big fish on the line, it's pulling so hard on the rod.|
20443|The angler pulled up strongly on the rod, drawing a crab out of the water!|
20444|I got nipped! Help me get this crab off! Hurry up!|
20445|Thank you... It was just an accident. Next time I will definitely show you how to catch a big fish.|
20446|This magic can promote biological growth. It can make this sunbird bigger.|
20447|Dalala... Falala... Mimimimi...!|
20448|Flower made weird motions, muttering a spell that you couldn't understand.|
20449|Smoke comes out from the Sunbird's body. Once the smoke dispersed, a bird egg showed up on the ground.|
20450|Mmm... How did it get turned around, was there something wrong with my gestures?|
20451|I have to come up with some new gestures...|
20452|Once Elena cast a spell on the crystal, it radiated a strange light.|
20453|And then, a demon appeared from the crystal!|
20454|I'm free at last! I will burn this world to ashes!|
20455|The demon cast a spell, but it only created a small flame.|
20456|Wait, wait... Why my body has become so small? I feel so weak!|
20457|The demon looked at you, and broke into cold sweat.|
20458|I'm sorry, it was just a joke. Please don't take it so seriously!|
20459|The demon disappeared quickly, and the crystal returned to its original shape.|
20460|The nearby Crystal Mine seems rather strange. Go investigate!|
20461|A little boy is in front. Go forward and see how you can help him.|
20462|Please defeat the Grudge Robot blocking the path.|
20463|Humans! You are not permitted to enter this cave...|
20464|Grudge Robot: Humans... appeared... everyone... kill...!|
20465|This crystal looks dangerous. Give it to me, I'll keep it safe.|
20466|What's so important that Akara has to have a meeting in such a complex manner?|
20467|Forget it... Let's take this opportunity to talk to him about the threats facing the Exploration.|
20468|After reassuring Omar a little, you immediately went back to the Dune Outpost with Tina.|
20469|You see lots of bats flying into the Camp Fire, one after another.|
20470|The boy is gravely injured. This escort operation has failed, please start again.|
20471|Seems that there's something that looks like a small animal in front...|
20472|Anything happening up front?|
20473|A very strange creature appeared ahead of you.|
20474|With a thud, powerful Goldie appeared!|
20475|To repay you, the Small Tanuki joined the boy's party!|
20476|Thankful, the Small Nymph joined the boy's party!|
20477|Small Guardian of the Flowers joined the boy's party, just to repay you!|
20478|Enemy reinforcements have arrived. Looks like there's no way to get into the ravine quietly.|
20479|You took an ax and started chopping. Soon, you had a bundle of wood.|
20480|The Tiny Bunnyhop is following behind you, quickly lead it to Milla at the entrance of the fishing village.|
20481|The Tiny Bunnyhop seems smell a cabbage near you. It looks at you with big, hopeful eyes.|
20482|After just one bite of the carrot, the Tiny Bunnyhop starts being affectionate with you and follows you.|
20483|The Lightning Brotherhood successfully occupied a base!|
20484|The Lightning Brotherhood lost a squad!|
20485|The leader of Lightning Brotherhood is here, personally, to fight it out!|
20486|The whole of the Lightning Brotherhood will launch a final Attack!|
20487|Hogan, elder of the Ham League, shows up to confront you, personally!|
20488|Suddenly, a wave of dizziness leaves you shaky. Everything around you slowly fades into endless darkness.|
20489|You feel you are now leaving a certain realm.|
20490|Hmm...I think it's better to pull this pirate into the bushes, otherwise, he'll be discovered!|
20491|Elena's magic teleported you back to Port Skandia.|
20492|People seem to be gathering in front. Go and see what happened.|
20493|A scream came from deep inside the altar. That's probably not a good sign.|
20494|Some villagers were attacked. Go and rescue them!|
20495|My child was trapped in a house on the east side. Please save my child!|
20496|A piercing scream sounded, somewhere up  front. Go and see what it is.|
20497|Hey, hey... Zinnia was taken away to the altar by a fallen fairy.|
20498|So many villagers are under attack. Go kill the monster!|
20499|Ah ah ah... I can't hold out... Please find Zinnia and rescue her.|
20500|My magic power ran out again... I swear, this usually doesn't happen to me! Anyways, please rescue Zinnia for me.|
20501|Zinnia is about to be sacrificed! Quickly, to the rescue!|
20502|Venomous Water Balls appear all around. Don't let them touch you!|
20503|Ah... This is just the beginning. One day, we will be back!|
20504|Huh. Looks like the bad guys have some stuff they're trying to hold on to!|
20505|Northern end of the Rebel Fort|
20506|Main gate of the Rebel Fort|
20507|The Energy is recharged, let's see how things went.|
20508|Bulkam Mk.III, activate!|
20509|Bulkam Mk.III activates, its main gear spinning.|
20510|Power upgrade begins... 50%... 60%....|
20511|Power breakthrough 100%...... 110%.....|
20512|Excellent, keep on upgrading the power!|
20513|Power breakthrough 150%...... 160%....|
20514|Excellent! The champion title shouldn't belong to anyone else but me!|
20515|Exceeding safe operating limits... Damage irreversible...|
20516|No! Bulkam Mk.III!|
20517|The body of the Giant Woodbeast starts to burn!|
20518|The Locate Function is faulty, activate the Follow Mode.|
20519|The  Robot on Patrol is starting to follow behind you; it seems that it needs you to lead it back to the Village.|
20520|Confirm returning to the Village and head to the Service Depot, thanking the strangers for their help.|
20521|The soothing water rushes over you.|
20522|You feel a strength welling up inside.|
20523|You feel that you've become stronger!|
20524|You carefully put the Purple Lotus into the bottle. Quickly, take it back to Posey.|
20525|It's completed! This is my newest invention - The Iron Gear!|
20526|As long as I wear it while competing in the Robot Competition, I will be the champion!|
20527|Stark put on the Iron Gear.|
20528|The Iron Gear didn't react at all.|
20529|So heavy...... I can't move......|
20530|After Darwin put on the Sarpa disguise, he looked exactly like a Sarpa. Which is more or less what you expected.|
20531|I guess I won't be exposed with this disguise... How does a Sarpa walk without legs?|
20532|Just a twist to the left, then a twist to the right...|
20533|Darwin walked, wobbly but rapidly, towards the Sarpa Community.|
20534|The Goat swallowed the apple in one gulp! Suddenly, it choked and died!|
20535|Seven Dwarves suddenly appeared.|
20536|Why did  you kill our Goat!?|
20537|You have to pay us the money that we used to buy this Goat!|
20538|The Goat suddenly coughed vehemently, and spit out a more or less whole apple.|
20539|Luckily, the Goat regained consciousness. It seems like it couldn't breathe when it choked on the apple.|
20540|......|
20541|What do we do now, Boss?|
20542|Luckily our Goat is fine. But don't you dare to feed it anything from now on!|
20543|After saying that, the Dwarves disappeared into the Forest again.|
20544|After you smeared nectar on the tree branches, fairies appeared, drawn by the scent of the nectar.|
20545|After the fairies finished all the nectar on the branches, they turned their heads to look at you. Hungrily.|
20546|The fairies smelled Nectar on you, and turned to attack!|
20547|You have found a mound at the spot marked on the map.|
20548|See if you can dig up the mound.|
20549|Edward started to build a new golem.|
20550|The new stone golem was assembled from the fragments of the old one.|
20551|Patrol near the camp!|
20552|The golem followed the command, and started the patrol.|
20553|The spring water radiated a ray of light. From the light, a fairy appeared.|
20554|Were you the one who just threw silver coins into the water?|
20555|Just tell me what you wish for, and maybe I'll grant you your wishes... Fat chance!|
20556|It's as if you humans have nothing better to do than to come here and throw rubbish into the pool; do you know how much trouble you've caused me?|
20557|The fairy threw a coin angrily at your face.|
20558|Don't throw any trash into the pool next time, understand?!|
20559|After saying that, the fairy disappeared back into the pool.|
20560|I've always wanted to train a Armored Lion myself. Let me try this.|
20561|Shake hands!|
20562|The Armored Lion raises its hand.|
20563|It's really effective, let me try something else.|
20564|Roar!|
20565|The Armored Lion roars loudly.|
20566|Looks like it's easier than I imagined. Let me make it a little more difficult.|
20567|Pretend to be dead!|
20568|The Armored Lion lays on the ground, motionless.|
20569|How amazing! It looks so convincing.|
20570|This Lion looks like it has great potential...Ok, you can get up.|
20571|The Armored Lion continues lying on the ground, motionless.|
20572|...Oh no... It really is dead.|
20573|You threw the Shining Stone at the Rock Beetle, and the Rock Beetle swallowed it in one gulp.|
20574|The Rock Beetle becomes bigger!|
20575|After the Scavenger Bird was hit by the slingshot, it attacked you rather angrily.|
20576|You put the Bird's egg next to the fire, and prepared to roast the egg.|
20577|The egg split suddenly, and a small Scavenger Bird popped out!|
20578|The small Scavenger Bird seems to think that you are its mother, and follows you closely.|
20579|The Slime was affected by the dirt-removing device, its body started to melt into a pool of clean water.|
20580|You splashed the wandering villager with a Water-Filled Bucket.|
20581|Aaaaaaah!|
20582|I've been chasing after a beauty for three days! Why did she suddenly disappear?|
20583|I won't give up - I must find her!|
20584|After saying that, the Wandering Villager went off in another direction again.|
20585|The giant's eyes were pierced by the needle. Reacting to the pain, he shut his eyes.|
20586|The trap is sprung! Bound by the trap, your prey cannot move. Quick, seize this opportunity!|
20587|As you scrub and clean the grail, a Chalice Demon suddenly appeared!|
20588|I finally got out of that dingy old grail!|
20589|First, give me your soul to pay the price!|
20590|Looks like there are a few frantic figures in front.|
20591|A cry for help rings out ahead, go and take a quick look.|
20592|The cry of a small boy comes from a small house on the eastern side! Quick, go and rescue him!|
20593|There are fighting sounds ahead, seems like the villagers are fighting against the decaying Sprites.|
20594|The are still many villagers trapped in the depths! Go rescue them.|
20595|There are piercing screams from the Altar. Could the children from Grass Kingdom be in trouble?|
20596|Ah hahaha! Live sacrificial offerings on our doorstep again! Come, let me corrupt you!|
20597|There is a lot of Venomous Water around here. Be careful, don't touch it, it will burn you.|
20598|Reid: Shiloh! It's over!|
20599|The captured rhino made some pitiful cries, calling out to nearby rhinos...|
20600|The surrounding rhinos slowly gather around after hearing the pitiful cries...|
20601|The furious rhinos charged towards the Oracle Camp, throwing the camp into a state of chaos.|
20602|A few villagers are talking in front, listen carefully to their conversation!|
20603|Toxic water has contaminated the area in front, we have to clear away the Rotten Flowertraps in order to clean it up.|
20604|Most of the contaminated toxic water at the Altar has vanished.|
20605|You call on the spirit of the Avians, and dress up according to the instructions in the ritual book.|
20606|You have successfully assumed the appearance of an Avian!|
20607|When the wild bull saw the red cloth, it charged angrily towards you!|
20608|Beer Goulash from the Stone Hammer Giants? I've been waiting for this for a long time! I'll eat it!|
20609|Marvin took up a piece of meat and swallowed it.|
20610|This taste is... a combination of sour beer and half-cooked beef. After two different flavors blended together, it produced a unique...|
20611|Ech.. It tastes horrible!|
20612|Marvin immediately spit out the meat.|
20613|Gump saw the can, and moved towards it excitedly.|
20614|Gump couldn't find the can, and returned to the Altar, jumping wildly about.|
20615|The penguins in the area, agitated by Gump's antics, began to move wildly as well!|
20616|Exedore: Wait for a moment, I want to clear away Gump's mess.|
20617|You whipped the Gnome captive, and questioned him regarding the whereabouts of the antidote.|
20618|You only know this little trick? I think you should get a stupid Makar here, perhaps I will be more afraid.|
20619|You pulled out the whip and again lashed the Gnome captive.|
20620|What do you think you are doing! Don't you dare mess with me again!|
20621|You pulled out the whip again and lashed the Gnome captive.|
20622|That's enough! If you hit me again with that thing, I will dig out your innards!|
20623|You ignored the Gnome's cursing, and lashed the Gnome captive again.|
20624|Sob sob... Please... I really don't know anything... Won't you please let me go?|
20625|You lashed the Gnome captive again, and insisted that he tells you the whereabouts of the antidote.|
20626|I only know that the boss has all the most valuable herbs, maybe he has the antidote that you need!|
20627|Please! That's all I know, really, please don't hit me anymore... Let me go please.|
20628|I'm sorry, why don't you just rest in the grass for awhile!|
20629|Dwarves just have short legs.|
20630|Hmm... Eh... That...|
20631|Let's, let's run before we talk!|
20632|Oh I'm so tired, I really want to take a rest after walking to and fro.|
20633|We will be able to change shifts and have someone else take over, after walking 35,821 steps!|
20634|With me around, no one should even try to sneak past here.|
20635|Heh heh! No one can get through my sword barrier!|
20636|Ohhhh, when will I be promoted so I don't have to do patrolling work anymore.|
20637|Don't mind that, maybe you will grow taller one day!|
20638|There seem to be sounds of a mechanism opening up in the depths of the cave.|
20639|A strong, eerie wind comes from the depths of the cave; it looks like some powerful monsters has appeared from within!|
20640|After you drink the potion, your chest feels extremely uncomfortable...|
20641|Strange changes occur on the sea's surface; the choppy waves become as calm as a lake...|
20642|The Water Gem starts shining brilliantly in your hands following that.|
20643|The trees fell silent, as if they were reacting to the Tree Gem.|
20644|The Tree Gem shines brilliantly in your hands following that.|
20645|The stone statue's magical aura is absorbed by the Magic Gem.|
20646|The Magic Gem now shines brilliantly in your hands.|
20647|You wake up and see Doctor Cal standing there, trying to talk to you.|
20648|Centurion Goliath has arrived. Quick, go defeat him!|
20649|Mummer the Lion's Roar Warlord is a highly capable Makar, use all your might to fight him!|
20650|Please don't underestimate the Second Prince's capability!|
20651|The strongest warrior, Eldest Prince Palo Ryan, is your toughest challenge!|
20652|You suddenly feel incredibly dizzy...|
20653|The scorching fire wrought havoc in the Rebel Fort, the supplies are all destroyed by the fire.|
20654|The lackeys guarding the entrance are down! Let's break in!|
20655|There are still other enemies ahead, let's continue on to rescue the Fairy!|
20656|Aah... I can feel a surge of strength...|
20657|Due to the side effects of the potion, the body of the Eldest Prince has... shrunk!|
20658|Gatekeeper of the Ozymand Temple - Imadal|
20659|The injured are recovering at the side. Despite their suffering, their fighting spirit is still high.|
20660|A broken city wall, a fire illuminating the sky; it looks like doomsday.|
20661|You are confused, you have no idea why you are here.|
20662|High Templar:  Andre is just ahead, go meet him quickly!|
20663|High Templar: Excellent, victory can't be too far away with you around!|
20664|High Templar: Justice wins!|
20665|Up ahead is the first Demon Commander, Sheal Corpsegrinder!|
20666|He is a powerful Demon General, defeat him!|
20667|You have defeated the first commander! Move forward with Andre's army!|
20668|The atmosphere here doesn't feel right...|
20669|That's enough! Don't you think of going anywhere!|
20670|Jasitra Demontongue is the second commander! Defeat him to move on!|
20671|Diabu Hellfire is just ahead of you, looking at you with contempt.|
20672|The Shadow Knight is right there! Accept your destiny and confront him!|
20673|Those two seem to be saying something... Go nearer and hear what they are saying.|
20674|The wild wolf ahead looks like it doesn't want to move.|
20675|Let's go back and see if there is a way.|
20676|Let's dash past the Wolf Guard while the pollen is still on us.|
20677|Seems like there's a guard calling you from the front right side, quick go find him!|
20678|Roar!!!|
20679|There's a flower with an unusual scent. Go and smear its pollen all over yourself.|
20680|You have a letter and a map, you should be able to find some traces of Mina.|
20681|Exedore: Go to the shining marker in front of Gump and put down the can.|
20682|You put down a can.|
20683|Exedore: Wait! Young man! You won't be able to lead Gump out if I don't give you the can!|
20684|Some fierce penguins have appeared, be careful!|
20685|Exedore: Continue moving to the next marker and put down the can.|
20686|Found it! The Treasure Room of the Pirates!|
20687|The bomb that the Pirate Leader threw will also injure himself.|
20688|Trick the Pirate Leader into going near the bomb that he has thrown, so you could destroy him!|
20689|Use this opportunity to sneak attack that Pirate!|
20690|Ooops...Looks like you just have to brave it out anyway!|
20691|The freed Game Bird made some sounds, which sound like gratitude to you.|
20692|The Magical Energy Detector emits a strong flashing light, and splits in mid-air.|
20693|A cage appeared. It seems that someone is inside. Quick, go open it and check!|
20694|A gigantic shadow appeared at the Sprite Altar ahead; it looks like it's the Demon himself! Quick, go release the Sprite and save her!|
20695|The person ahead should be the consignor. Quickly, go and talk to her.|
20696|The Demon Recruits are obstructing your path... Try to communicate with them; and if that doesn't work, get physical!|
20697|So much treasure here! Where did these pirates get this from?|
20698|Hmmm... Wait! These gold coins are actually gold-plated.|
20699|Surprisingly there is such a vain Pirate Boss, seems like Faya's treasure dreams...|
20700|Probe and find out the truth behind the Pirates' big secret treasure.|
20701|Be aware of the areas the guards are watching closely. Don't go into them.|
20702|It feels like... A surge of incredible power, trying to burst from your body.|
20703|After some work, you dug out some metal ore; quick, go pick it up!|
20704|Gotta tell Perry about the situation here, fast. Don't alert the enemy...|
20705|You put the drugged Pirate into the bag and carry him back to Perry.|
20706|You shout for Selena outside the cottage, in order to test your info.|
20707|Adjutant Follower: Who's making all that noise outside? Are you tired of living?|
20708|The Adjutant Follower stomped out. Seems Selena isn't in the cottage.|
20709|During the next quest, you will disguise yourself as Braeden to sneak onto the shore at night and place a trap there.|
20710|You have to avoid the area the Catseye Parrot's is watching in the process, otherwise you'll be forced to start over.|
20711|Three traps have been put into your Backpack. You must put them at the designated setup point.|
20712|A few Pirates are turning the cottage upside down...|
20713|You draw the building's location, then head towards the eastern side.|
20714|The map in your hands is also getting more and more complete...|
20715|The camp configuration map is completed... Bring it to Luther quickly.|
20716|You ask Mac to release Selena, or you'll have to rescue her.|
20717|Mac steps backwards slowly...his mannerisms becoming a little strange.|
20718|Catseye Pirate Leader Mac turns and runs off to the west. Get after him!|
20719|The Catseye Pirate Leader is surrounded by guards , best you don't go near him too abruptly...|
20720|You left a unique mark on the Catseye Pirates' flag with a charcoal pencil.|
20721|You make a special mark on the Pirates' flag while they aren't looking.|
20722|Tanner Jones, Hunters' Team Leader, has arrived at the Stone Hammer Camp. He is about to negotiate with Chief Amon.|
20723|In a while, there will be many wild beasts coming towards here.|
20724|You have two skills that you can use.|
20725|The first one is "Filling the Ammo". You can only use the second skill - "Strafe" after using the first one.|
20726|The second, "Strafe," is the main attacking technique, and can fire bullets rapidly.|
20727|After filling up, you can open fire as much as you like within fifteen seconds.|
20728|If you run out of ammunition, just reload.|
20729|Get ready! The wild beasts will be here soon.|
20730|You have exhausted all ammo. Please reload.|
20731|In this round of the competition, you have to defend your position against the Chief of Stone Hammer.|
20732|Giants will come forth from three directions to attack your stronghold.|
20733|You are on the defending team, leading your Hunters to defend your position.|
20734|Your Hunters' Team will wait for your orders before launching an attack.|
20735|When you are ready to give orders, please walk to the column behind them and press "Open Fire".|
20736|If your stronghold is destroyed, please press "Reconstruct Stronghold" to repair your stronghold.|
20737|If, after the Giants have launched five waves of attack, you have at least two Defense structures left at every stronghold...|
20738|Then you would have won this round of competition.|
20739|The competition is about to begin, please get ready.|
20740|The first wave of attack begins!|
20741|The Giants are attacking from the center and the right side!|
20742|The Giants are attacking from the center and the left side!|
20743|The Giants are attacking from the left and right sides!|
20744|The Giants are attacking from three directions!|
20745|Tanner: Boys, open fire!|
20746|Tanner: No need to go easy on the bullets boys, fire!|
20747|Tanner: Pull the trigger, and fire!|
20748|You have successfully defended the stronghold, and won this round of the competition!|
20749|At this moment, Tanner, the Team Leader, looks sharply at Chief Amon.|
20750|Not long after, Isaac went to check the coast.|
20751|He really found the bodies of many Pirates - the plan worked.|
20752|Please defeat the Demon Recruit guarding the entrance.|
20753|Braeden has finished setting up the bombs.|
20754|He can begin to work on the next plan following that.|
20755|After the rhinos took a look at their moaning companion, they started to tap their front hooves incessantly and made deep, low sounds.|
20756|Halton: Mmm, all the stolen ceremonial vessels have been found, now we just have the Stolen Ceremonial Tome to worry about.|
20757|Halton: The Stolen Ceremonial Tome has been found, but I still need to find all the Ceremonial Vessels.|
20758|Halton: The Stolen Ceremonial Tome and all the Ceremonial Vessels have been found, we can go meet the Foreman now.|
20759|Excellent, the first Ceremonial Vessel is now in our hands.|
20760|Halton: Excellent, the first Ceremonial Vessel is in our hands.|
20761|This is the second Vessel; there are many others to look for¡K|
20762|Halton: This is the second Vessel; there are many others to look for¡K|
20763|Four Vessels have been found. It's going more smoothly than expected.|
20764|Halton: Four Vessels have been found. It's going more smoothly than expected.|
20765|The seventh Ceremonial Vessel! We only have the last one left to find.|
20766|Halton: The seventh Ceremonial Vessel! We only have the last one left to find.|
20767|Please clear off the enemies in front before continuing to move forward!|
20768|Confound it! Ambush! Looks like we have to clear them all off before we can continue to move forward.|
20769|Please wait till the Electroreceptor has reached a fixed point before trying again.|
20770|The Electroreceptor is at a fixed point. The teleport function is ready.|
20771|The Foreman will be waiting for me at the exit at the top right hand corner of the camp. I have to get there fast.|
20772|Halton: The Foreman will be waiting for me at the exit at the top right hand corner of the camp. I have to get there fast.|
20773|The body of the Shadow Knight turned into black fire and vanished.|
20774|The Hunters Group, led by Tanner Jones, and the Giants with Amon both went in the direction of the Hunting Ground.|
20775|Chief Amon decides to have a competition of reaction with Tanner.|
20776|The first round of the competition ends with a draw between both parties.|
20777|Therefore, the Giants and the Hunters' Team moved to a different location on the Hunting Ground.|
20778|Both parties prepare for the second round of the competition.|
20779|You left a mark on the Pirates' flag - they didn't seem to notice.|
20780|While you are waiting, go to talk to the residents and ask if there's anything you can help with.|
20781|The sprite is moving inside the sack; get it back to Halton quickly.|
20782|The Sprite flies around you affectionately. Bring it along with you, to look for the King of Magic Flowers.|
20783|When the smell of the Gland got to the King of the Flowertraps, he came out of the flower shrubs angrily.|
20784|The King of the Flowertraps is greatly affected, reducing its strength.|
20785|The Drunk Flower Beetle is in the Flower Field at the south of the Village. You can only deal with the King of the Flowertraps after getting the Gland from the beetle.|
20786|Halton hid in the large urn with agile moves. Quick, take him to the Mistwalker Tribe.|
20787|The Elder ran away in haste; resulting in an uproar among the Gnomes.|
20788|You found a letter on the floor, dropped by the Elder when he ran away.|
20789|Clark Farm is in the middle of the hills. Find the Church's Scholar there.|
20790|You filled the bucket with clear spring water, now bring it back to Rosie.|
20791|Rosie needs a bit more time. See if there's anything else you can do.|
20792|You sprayed the pesticide around so that no bugs would approach.|
20793|Rosie's work should be done by now. Go back and look for her.|
20794|Navea is in the north-east; you'll see the gates when you reach it.|
20795|Even though you don't know his motive, just do what he says for now.|
20796|Nothing has changed in the area; however, the gem on the altar is gone.|
20797|Guardians are wandering nearby; they attack anyone who gets near.|
20798|Alabastren Temple is full of Gnomes and Robots; no one knows why¡K|
20799|Right, looks like Anthony has also sent some people to investigate the Alabastren Temple Ruins. Why don't you ask him if he needs help, too.|
20800|The Gnomes have put a lot of explosives in the Ruins, quickly splash water on them and they should fizzle.|
20801|After the machine made some noises, a piece of paper filled with symbols came out from it.|
20802|The Resistor gave out an electric wave, rendering the Mainframe Soldier motionless.|
20803|You put the weak Mistwalker Elder into the sack and bring him back to look for Omar.|
20804|The villagers sang and danced around the altar happily, laughing time and again. You joined in too, and enjoyed a joyous ceremony with the villagers.|
20805|You are our hero!|
20806|Thank you!|
20807|Ohh--Yay!|
20808|The ceremony this year is just fantastic!|
20809|Let's dance now!|
20810|Some Pirates are loading boxes... Not sure what they're packing up¡K|
20811|The Village Chief looks like he's busy, and has no time for you.|
20812|Maybe you should go to the village first, and see if you can help out with anything.|
20813|The planning is done, go meet Jess at the Flower Field.|
20814|After taking care of the angry guard, you have to let the Village Chief know about this.|
20815|Anthony's disciple is already heading for the Alabastren Temple Ruins, go meet him there.|
20816|Go to the Alabastren Temple quickly, you have to stop them before the seal is broken!|
20817|You decide to go to the Dwarves' Village to repair this broken down machine.|
20818|The competition is about to begin.|
20819|What the hell... I definitely will not let you take Selena away!|
20820|A girl who went after her dreams fell in love with a pirate leader, who gave up everything to be with her.|
20821|This kind of ending isn't so bad, at least... Everyone is safe and sound.|
20822|You returned to Helonia. You have to tell Madeline the truth.|
20823|Are you the person I'm expecting to meet?|
20824|Amon: Heh heh, looks like your hunting skill is just so so, Tanner|
20825|Amon: Oh? Looks like this is going to be interesting.|
20826|Amon: You've almost caught up with me. Now I have to get serious!|
20827|Amon: Mmm... Let me add it up... What, it's actually the same?|
20828|There's another person who's also possessed by the spirit? Gotta ask Willie to find out where they are.|
20829|Brian hid in the cavern in front... Gotta get Joel out no matter what!|
20830|The Parrot lives in the forest west of Helonia. Looks like quite a distance to walk...|
20831|To get the Alchemist to take part, you must travel to Bella's Orchard.|
20832|Hopefully these Spicy Apple Escargot will convince Perry to take part.|
20833|Luther is disguised and is in the Pirates Camp. Go meet him, quickly!|
20834|The keys to the Treasure Chest are with the Lunarin Chief. Get ready to start a new journey!|
20835|Not being able to borrow the keys has left you a little disappointed...
However, you saw a young girl in the village, who looks very troubled. Maybe she needs some help.|
20836|The threat from the Flowertraps looms larger; better destroy some Flowertraps before meeting Jess.|
20837|Maybe the Scholar at Clark Farm will know about the Wax Seal and the Ceremonial Tome|
20838|The Templar from the Church is waiting for you outside Navea.|
20839|Even the Ceremonial Stones have been lost after the shrine was taken over by Gnomes. I must let the Village Chief know about this.|
20840|The Mistwalker Invaders represent the army most well-versed in the art of battle in the Mistwalker Tribe, I gotta take care of them first!|
20841|The seal of the shrine is already broken. You must not let the strength of the shrine end up in Makar hands.|
20842|Looks like I have to go to the Cactakara Forest if I want to repair this ancient machine.|
20843|After this, I'll use the Halo Energy Detector to find the location of the Collectors...|
20844|Rallied by the commander, the Makar Warriors let out a roar of fierce, fighting spirit, and are ready for the battle!|
20845|Disguised as a Giant Woodbeast, you can avoid the guard's notice and reactivate the Teleporter!|
20846|You've finally obtained the Halo Grass; bring it back to Pierre quickly!|
20847|The Crocodiles nearby will attack the spectators if I don't get rid of them before the finals begin.|
20848|Go to the hill to the northwest, and help the collectors bring back the collecting tools left behind there.|
20849|The thief is hiding on the northeastern side. Use the Electrifier to subdue her!|
20850|Gotta take some Butterfly Fairy Eggs to Fenrich, to get help finding the energy source.|
20851|The energy source is under the waterfall on the northeastern side. Looks like you're gonna get wet.|
20852|The Spirit Separator is of no use at all... Looks like you gotta return to Navea and ask the Grand Bishop why.|
20853|Victoria gives you two bottles of disinfectant, and cautions you once again to be sure that you use them.|
20854|You carefully spray the disinfectant all around you.|
20855|You saw young Bonita waving at you, looking rather troubled.|
20856|Bobby should be heading in the direction of the Pitmere Canyon, along the path westwards. Head up the path to find him.|
20857|This should be Bobby's package; his name is written on it, after all.|
20858|If the leader is defeated, the Scavenger Bird will keep to itself; go to the clifftop, use bait to lure the Leader out.|
20859|Bobby will be staying under the care of Luther and Rebecca, so you have to bring Bobby's map back to town.|
20860|Get rid of the Spring Waterling in the north before going back.|
20861|The Investigation Team is already prepared to go to the places Bobby marked and rescue the hostages.|
20862|First, defeat the Slimeling in the north that's obstructing the way. Then, go meet up with the Investigation Team Members with whom you've lost contact.|
20863|Floyd can be a little impatient, so if he's rude to you in any way, please bear with him.|
20864|Floyd looks, angrily, at the Witch next to him; the Witch remains expressionless and silent.|
20865|Don't waste your effort; no matter how many times these Protectors have been destroyed, they will continue to live again.|
20866|The Witch, who has been silent so far, startled you when she suddenly began to speak.|
20867|Kargula is unhappy, his holy wrath oppressing your mind and body.|
20868|Kargula is very happy that you've made an accurate judgement!|
20869|Move forward to the next flag with a guiding light spot and destroy it.|
20870|Kargula's final test begins!|
20871|Kargula Hyper Incarnation is here! Use all your might to defeat him!|
20872|The Village Chief's wife has something to tell you, follow her and listen.|
20873|The bucket of explosives is drenched, and cannot be ignited.|
20874|Amon: What are you doing?! You aren't thinking of chickening out are you?|
20875|Amon: The Tanner that I know isn't a coward!|
20876|Amon: You can't barge in here, get back to your own position!|
20877|You can't leave the Hunting Ground during the competition, go back to your stronghold.|
20878|You follow behind the Village Chief's Wife as she slowly leaves Port Skandia, heading in the direction of the Helonia Coast...|
20879|The Chief's Wife's sadness for your departure is written all over her face...|
20880|Catseye Herald: You wait right here, no tricks. The leader is almost here.|
20881|Following that, steady footsteps can be heard from the front....|
20882|Your stronghold on the left is destroyed! You lost!|
20883|Amon: Hahaha! So, you aren't that powerful after all, Tanner!|
20884|Amon: Who was that person who just now pledged that he will have the proprietary rights of the Hunting Ground?|
20885|Amon: Hmmph, since you've lost, then get out of my Hunting Ground!|
20886|After this fierce offensive and defensive warfare, Leader Tanner lost the combat.|
20887|So...|
20888|The fight for the Hunting Ground between the Hunters Group and the Stone Hammer Tribe continues...|
20889|An azure light orb floats next to you, making you rather ill at ease....|
20890|A few garrison members have surrounded Brian, locked in a face-off!|
20891|Tanner Jones, Leader of the Hunters' Team, has won.|
20892|Both parties returned to the Stone Hammer Camp, and negotiated for the last time.|
20893|Finally, Tanner, the Team Leader, wins this round of the competition.|
20894|He made a promise to share the Hunting Ground with Chief Amon.|
20895|Nothing happened!|
20896|Garrison troops again? Looks like this is the right route!|
20897|Get to the end with the little boy, and obtain victory!|
20898|First Village Chief: Help!|
20899|First Village Chief: A bunch of Spiders are coming! Drive them back!|
20900|After you activate the Halo Energy Detector, the device indicates that there's wave activity on the mountain path.|
20901|After the second round of Halo Energy Detecting, it looks like the wave source should be ahead.|
20902|Vhell pointed the sword at you, and you were instantly surrounded by a strong magic power.|
20903|You are unable to withstand Vhell's strength; looks like breaking out by force will not work...|
20904|You follow Akers's instructions and reactivate the Teleporter - you can use it to go in and out of the Ruins now!|
20905|An air of chilling terror envelopes you. Your instinct tells you that you don't want to stay here for long.|
20906|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'East City Mountain Pass.'"|
20907|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'East City Ruins.'"|
20908|Water Purifier No.1 lets out a low, mechanical sound, and releases a purifying agent.|
20909|Water Purifier No.2 was not successfully activated, until you kicked it into action.|
20910|You place Water Purifier No.3 near the waterfall, and the activation process is successful.|
20911|Caroline moves backwards, slowly, in high alert. Quickly, use the Electrifier and shock her into unconsciousness before she manages to escape!|
20912|A strong light emits from Caroline's body, and a figure scurries out of the bright light.|
20913|When you entered Brevis, a powerful electromagnetic wave immediately made you feel ill at ease.|
20914|For safety's sake, you quickly retreated from the region of electromagnetic waves activity.|
20915|The Collectors gratefully thank you for the herbal ointment.|
20916|After Vhell discovered you, a chilly, terrifying air immediately fills up the space between you.|
20917|You again! I've already warned you... Now you shall face my fury!|
20918|The Detector projected electric waves at Vhell, and he was momentarily unable to resist the powerful force.|
20919|Vhell was affected by the Shrink-Ray, his huge body becoming very small...|
20920|You've already chased all the aggressive creatures out of this area. The entrance in the east is safe.|
20921|After careful inspection, the western entrance is sure to be safe.|
20922|The Robot Competition Finals are about to begin; you shall pilot the Augustus Mk.VII in the finals yourself!|
20923|After you've entered the cockpit, you can control four commands. They are: 
Heavy Fist (Attack), Defense Barrier (Defense), Defense Crumbled (Defense broken down), Halo Repair (Restore).|
20924|Use these skills appropriately, pay attention to the opponent's actions and moves, and lay claim the trophy at the Finals!|
20925|Alain: Let's welcome last competition's champion, God-Hand Montero!|
20926|Montero drives the Montebrown Mk. 5 out of the machine's storeroom, and slowly walks up the stage.|
20927|Montero opens the firing holes on his shoulders, firing pyrotechnic bullets into the sky.|
20928|The dazzling fireworks dance in the sky, bringing the scene to a climax.|
20929|Unexpected results has fired up the audience at the scene.|
20930|After you've left the cockpit, the audience swarmed you with praise.|
20931|As the audience slowly disperses, peace and quiet finally returns to the Competition Arena.|
20932|After careful searching, you saw a hidden cave under the waterfall.|
20933|You've drawn some blood samples from the Caustic Sarpa with the blood extractor.|
20934|You hit the Sleeping Lumberjack, hard, with Caine's Hammer.|
20935|You caught the Wild Parrot and imprisoned it in the wooden cage.|
20936|The blowdart hit the Porter: bag him before the effect wears off!|
20937|A Pirate from a tent in the distance is signalling to you to go over to him.|
20938|After inspecting, you can be sure that the eastern side of the Orchard is safe.|
20939|Apart from a few fleeing Tanuki, nothing special came up on the road.|
20940|Robinson is busily negotiating with the Hunting Village Chief; take the opportunity to get some information from the villagers.|
20941|The Toucants live outside the village. If you want to capture them, you'll have to make a trip out of the village.|
20942|Gotta collect some Cactus Sap first. With that and the recommendation letter, you can go to the Hunting Ground and rescue the Hunters.|
20943|Looks like Durango already has the goods loaded; he's just waiting for you to set out.|
20944|Faint sounds of footsteps can be heard ahead; there's a person coming in this direction.|
20945|Many Pirates have appeared in the area, fight carefully!|
20946|All the Pirates in the area have been defeated. You can continue to move forward.|
20947|Elite Pirates elite appear ahead; they will use the highly damaging Tornado Spin.|
20948|After getting rid of the obstructing Pirates, you can continue to move forward.|
20949|The box beside the wall contains traps, maybe they will come in handy.|
20950|This trap looks like it can stop enemies from moving, maybe it will be useful.|
20951|Giant Jordan, the Abyss Axe Leader, appears before you!|
20952|The skill of the Abyss Axe Leader is great; remember to evade when attacked.|
20953|The Abyss Axe Leader is very powerful, quick, evade!|
20954|Quickly confirm the state of the battle with Reid!|
20955|The other Golden Flowertraps have heard you shouting, and rushed over to grab the Fragrant Mushrooms from your hand.|
20956|After all the Golden Flowertraps have been destroyed, the Greedy Merchant quickly runs in, searching for something.|
20957|Get the Fragrant Mushroom from the Greedy Merchant's assistant, and use it to lure the Golden Flowertrap out!|
20958|Bang! The Golden Flowertrap is finally being lured out!|
20959|The valuable gold is finally retrieved. Return it to the Merchant, and advise him to help the poor and the weak more in the future!|
20960|The Greedy Merchant looks very anxious, ask him what's the matter!|
20961|Sounds can be heard from Heaven...|
20962|Kargula: You shall soon face your last test.|
20963|Kargula: You didn't focus enough! Do it again!|
20964|Do away with the flag in front that has a guiding light-spot|
20965|Kargula: As long as you do what you've done before, you should pass, if you keep your wits about you.|
20966|Kargula: The test shall soon begin.|
20967|Kargula: You've proven that you've superb observation skills.|
20968|Kargula: Show me all your talents then!|
20969|You've collected all the Fragrant Mushrooms. Go lure the Golden Flowertrap out!|
20970|Your stronghold in the center has been destroyed, you lost!|
20971|Your stronghold on the right has been destroyed, you lost!|
20972|Tanner: The stronghold is being attacked, boys, repair it!|
20973|Tanner: Quickly, restore the Defense fortification! You don't want to be beaten up by the Giants, right?!|
20974|Tanner: This is urgent; don't let the Defense fortification be destroyed!|
20975|In this round of the competition, you must battle with the Stonehammer Chief.

Giants will charge from three directions and attack your stronghold; you must lead the hunters between these three points in order to defend the stronghold.

Your Hunter Group will wait for you to give orders before launching the attack.|
20976|When you want to give orders, please go to the blue column behind them.
As the Team Leader, you will have two skills: Open Fire (Attack) and Reconstruct Stronghold (Restore).|
20977|At every stronghold, you need to have at least two intact defense fortifications in order to claim victory.|
20978|Perhaps the Witch is not an enemy after all. Let's try her method first.|
20979|As long as you use Hazel's spell at the Caerment Altar, you will be able to know all about the things that happened at this location.|
20980|So the Witch and the Shadow Knight know each other. It seems she has some secrets that she doesn't want to reveal.|
20981|However, the most important task at hand is to ensure that the hostages are safe. Quickly, go back and report all that you've seen.|
20982|If the source of the mutation comes from the Demarech Pool, maybe it's better to ask for Rebecca's help. She's familiar with this place.|
20983|Do you want to investigate the Demarech Pool? Let me be the one to assist you!|
20984|Bobby regains consciousness. He still sounds rather weak.|
20985|Rebecca sees that you are about to leave, and stops you. It seems like she has something to ask you.|
20986|The Shock Core resonated with the Miracle Rock Monster, and the Rock Monster's body began to disintegrate.|
20987|These Light Orbs are scattered around the Demarech Pool. Go destroy them.|
20988|The Light Orbs give out a strong flashing light and quickly disappear.|
20989|My father is still trapped in the mine in the north. I have to go save him.|
20990|Your injuries have not healed yet, don't push yourself too hard.|
20991|Bobby is still worried about his father's safety. You better go to the Demarech Mines District and see if the rescue operation is successful.|
20992|The residents nearby look rather tired, send the water to them quickly.|
20993|I'm not sure why the Shadow Knight wants these stones, but I'm sure he's up to no good.|
20994|We should keep The Shadow Knight from taking these ores.|
20995|In order to understand the purpose of the Miracle Stone, invite the Foreman over for a chat.|
20996|You took advantage of the Foreman's fatigue and used a rope to tie him up!|
20997|Quickly, bring the Foreman back to the camp to look for Nate.|
20998|The area has already been taken over by the Rock Beetles - this would be the work of the Shadow Knight.|
20999|There are still a number of Miners digging nearby. Seems like the Shadow Knight needs a huge volume of Miracle Ore.|
21000|You've done well, you should be able to stop the Shadow Knight, now.|
21001|You guys are too naive, this is just one of the Shadow Knight's excavation sites.|
21002|Actually the Mine in the east is his main target.|
21003|Old man, What proof do you have? You sound like you know the Shadow Knight very well.|
21004|You are stunned by what the old man said; could he have some connection with the Shadow Knight?|
21005|I can't believe that you are actually Analisa's master. I was really impolite just now.|
21006|No worries; young people are usually a little impatient, I don't mind.|
21007|Harvey says, with a complacent smile.|
21008|Go to the Marauder Camp, and get rid of the Marauder Patrolmen. Then tell Hamilton, the Investigator, about the Shadow Knight's plan.|
21009|The Miners are gathered at the Mining Area in the north. Go get the map from them, quickly!|
21010|Quickly defeat the Marauder Captain and get the Miracle Crystal back; you must not let the Shadow Knight get the Crystal.
|
21011|Luckily, the Miracle Crystal has not been sent to the Shadow Knight yet. Take it back to Hamilton.|
21012|Vice Leader Floyd can't wait to send someone into the Miner's Steppe.|
21013|I'm not sure what kind of ambush the enemies have set up inside. You better get in there quickly, and help him.|
21014|Harvey seems to have something important to tell you. Go quickly to the Mine in the West and look for him.|
21015|The things in the box on the side, get them out now.|
21016|The Shadow Knight has already gotten the Cube of Gaia. You have to go back immediately and report to the Grand Bishop.|
21017|Amon: Ok, cease fire!|
21018|However, he didn't find Bluto the Pirate Adjutant's corpse.|
21019|After this, you will play as Isaac, to experience the sneaking into the Pirates Camp to give out the treasures.|
21020|When you are Isaac, you will have a skill: Show Treasure. 
When you use it at the designated location, you can show the fake treasure to the Pirates.|
21021|You have to show the treasure to four different guards and Adjutant Bluto in order to complete your plan.|
21022|The Scavenger Bird King let out a shrill cry, scaring away the Scavenger Birds nearby.|
21023|In order to stop the endless fighting with the Stone Hammer Tribe,|
21024|Tanner Jones, Leader of the Hunters' Team, decides to negotiate directly with Chief Amon of the Stone Hammer Tribe.|
21025|With that, he took a few Hunters and went to the Stone Hammer Tribe in person.|
21026|Loud rumbling sounds come from beneath the ground--a gigantic beetle is trying to dig its way out of the ground!|
21027|You do not have the Fragrant Mushrooms with you, please go down to collect some from the Mushroom Heap.|
21028|Use the Fragrant Mushrooms, the Golden Flowertrap's favorite food, and tempt it into not eating gold coins again.|
21029|The breath of resentful ghosts nearby is fouls this place.|
21030|The Ghost Crystal Miner gave out a big roar, and pounced on you.|
21031|Please go to Tomitsa at Demarech Mines to look for Annie.|
21032|The Eidolon's Energy miraculously enabled the Totem to renew itself. However, it seems that it isn't completely restored.|
21033|The Gaia Cube glowed with Eidolon Energy. It looks like something is going to happen.|
21034|The energy-filled Gaia Cube starts to release power, filling the air with turbulence!|
21035|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, "Iron Titan" Gigas!|
21036|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the radiant Eidolon, Aelius - "Knight of the Sun"!|
21037|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the terribly powerful Eidolon, Eligos - the "Duke of Darkness"!|
21038|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the incredible Eidolon, Sigrun - "Champion of the Slain"!|
21039|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the immensely powerful Eidolon, "Empress of Torment" Bel-Chandra!|
21040|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, Uzuriel - the "Heavenly Defender"!|
21041|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the electrifying Eidolon, Vayu the "Stormbringer"!|
21042|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, "Miasmic Serpent" Quelkulan!|
21043|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the incredible Eidolon, "Emerald Tempest" Yarnaros!|
21044|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the powerful Eidolon, Bahadur the "Trampling Thunder"!|
21045|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the cunning Eidolon, Kotonoha the "Nine-Tailed Vixen"!|
21046|A tremendous amount of energy bursts from the Cube of Gaia, summoning the cunning Eidolon, "Feline Emperor" Tigerius Caesar!|
21047|Please report your Quest to the Grand Merchant before leaving here!|
21048|Head to the north and find Gump, and teach the little penguin you meet on the way a lesson!|
21049|The warriors of Falco are waiting for you in front.|
21050|The Falco have already launched an attack! Quickly, join with the three Eagles!|
21051|The Three Eagles demonstrated an exuberant fighting spirit, which demoralised the enemies around them!|
21052|The just, fighting spirit of justice of the Three Eagles can demoralise enemies!|
21053|Continue to move forward, there are still many enemies waiting for us in front!|
21054|There are some hostages being held not too far ahead!|
21055|The hostages were successfully rescued!|
21056|The alcohol in the Crazy Avian, Kafei, exploded from its body! It went into a state of turbulence.|
21057|The Falco will be here waiting for enemies. While they're distracted, go to the small house on the western side and rescue the hostages.|
21058|The Falco reinforcements are here!|
21059|Be careful! The Red Colt Clan's raiders have gotten behind us.|
21060|Kafei: Don't be afraid brother! I'm coming!|
21061|Be careful! The the Red Colt Clan is gonna ambush us!|
21062|The Red Colt Clan's army is in disarray; only the Clan's Chief, Zibo, is left!|
21063|Zibo, Chief of the Red Colt Clan, has arrived!|
21064|Zibo: So, that Cowardly Barlo actually managed to scrounge up some help! But it doesn't matter - I won't be defeated!|
21065|Zibo ignites the demonic energy and flies into a rage!|
21066|You join forces with the Three Eagles and finally defeated the legendary Zibo!|
21067|Oscar: Wahahahaha! I'm here to get my treasure back!|
21068|Mina: Oh my god! Is there anyone who can stop Oscar?|
21069|Excellent...The retreat to the Hunting Village is still safe. Looks like we don't have to worry about being surrounded.|
21070|Oops... The Giants' vanguard is already very near Drake and the rest!|
21071|It should be enough to put the broken stone pieces into the reagent... We'll just see what Dallan can derive from that.|
21072|The Giants' Weapon might be related to the creature that Wyatt is investigating, so go see him.|
21073|Wyatt said someone has been abducted by Avians, probably for a sacrifice. Could it be the missing Roger?|
21074|The giant monster, Argus, is headed for Deep's Cavern. Go and tell Robinson, quickly!|
21075|In order to get more information about Deep's Cavern, gotta meet the soldiers outside the Cave.|
21076|The Hunting Group Leader who is now battling the Giants might know whether the barrier is of the Giants' making.|
21077|There seemed to be some disturbance at the northern end of the Stone Hammer Tribe's territory not too long ago. Looks like it's necessary to do a search.|
21078|Chase away the Dimetrodon that's occupying the mountain path in the north! Make sure that Roger can return safely.|
21079|Maya says that the barrier of Deep's Cavern has been removed. Maybe you should go and verify it?|
21080|Argus, created by the Shadow Knight, has obtained an enormous strength. We gotta ensure that he doesn't leave the Cave!|
21081|This has finally come to a conclusion. Now go back to Navea and let the Grand Bishop know about the situation here.|
21082|The slender physique of humans is really an asset to investigative work... Use this advantage to investigate the Rebel Army's Camp!|
21083|Go to the town square of Candetonn and set off the fireworks.|
21084|Is this the gate of the Rebel Army's Camp? There seems to be an injured person at the side...|
21085|Take Tiny's bag and bloodstained bracelet with you and sneak into the Rebel Army's Camp to meet up with Tatiana.|
21086|Go to the Squad Leader and read out Tatiana's Secret Order. If he doesn't surrender, get rid of him!|
21087|You set the nearby supply boxes on fire with the torch. Fanned by the wind, it grew quickly into a big fire.|
21088|You set the supplies near the commissary on fire - the Rebel Army's supply line is now seriously disrupted.|
21089|A ferocious fire dances menacingly before you. The outcome of this battle has been more or less fixed!|
21090|Micha, the Rebel Army General, has been captured alive! Bring him to trial in front of Leo!|
21091|Go to the Leyline Arena and meet the imperial craftsmen, they will custom-make exclusive equipment for you.|
21092|In order to have the Battle Soul's blessings on the armor, you have to challenge the Guardian at Swineloch.|
21093|Wake the War Spirit up so that Pascal can put the War Spirit's blessings onto your outfit.|
21094|After that, you have to go to Filthrun Croft, and try to get the Guardian to bless your weapon.|
21095|Bring the Energy Breath of Quick Flame back to the Leyline Arena, and let it become the source of your great fighting strength.|
21096|The battle is threatening, between the Makar and the Gnomes! Mummer, the warlord on the front line, will need your support.|
21097|You finally obtained the antidote! You gotta rush back to the Ventos Tribe quickly with it.|
21098|Go together with Para Ryan to see the Waterhole Guardian, and persuade him to let you go search the Shrine for the antidote.|
21099|In order to save his brothers, Para Ryan dashed into the Shrine without care. Go after him, quickly!|
21100|All the Smelly Spider Eggs are collected in this area. Go back and report it to Village Chief!|
21101|1. Trial of Colors. (Knock out those with a different skin color)|
21102|2. Trial of Shapes. (Knock out those with different physiques)|
21103|3. Trial of Speed. (Knock out those moving at a different speed)|
21104|4. Trial of Names. (Knock out those with different names)|
21105|5. Trial of Auras. (Knock out those with different colored auras)|
21106|6. Trial of Directions. (Knock out those advancing in a different direction)|
21107|7. Trial of Mind. (Target every monster with a different status)|
21108|Leo Ryan promises to form an alliance with the Church. Quickly, take this piece of good news to the Grand Bishop!|
21109|You entangled the Jerboa tightly with the rope you threw out, capturing it.|
21110|Tatiana shifts herself into a battle stance and attacks!|
21111|You read out the Secret Order in front of the Rebel Squad Leader, trying your best to get him to surrender.|
21112|As the heraldic seal emits a strong light, you feel a surge of strength being passed into your body.|
21113|Adonis swiftly brandishes his weapon and charged towards you!|
21114|You rope the Wild Rhino with the extremely tough lasso, and force it to follow you.|
21115|You clutch the Oracle Ointment close to your chest, hurrying back to the Ventos Tribe...|
21116|The "Leyline Arena" is the most important event in Makar traditional sports...|
21117|Kargula: Target on every monster and suss out those that are of different states.|
21118|You've finally defeated the Demon! Quickly, get the sprite out!|
21119|Due to your contribution, Leo Ryan, the Makar King, allows  you to participate in this grand event, challenging the elite of the Makar in the arena.|
21120|This will be your best chance to win the respect of the Makar. Try your best to win!|
21121|The First Village Chief walked back.|
21122|Protect Billy and defeat the Grudge Robots blocking the path.|
21123|The members of  garrison continue to run out from within; looks like we have to defeat them in order to continue moving forward.|
21124|Please protect the Little Boy and move forward.|
21125|First Village Chief: I can only rely on you... Kill the Mother Spider and bring back the Spider Silk.|
21126|We got enough Spider Silk. Now go back and report it to Village Chief!|
21127|First Village Chief: The first enemy queen is somewhere here. Keep an eye out for it!|
21128|In order to help the villagers, please look for the Smelly Arachnid Spider Eggs and Smelly Arachnid Silk!|
21129|Follow Meira and continue to move forward.|
21130|The Priestess blocked the way into the Altar Sacred Grounds, so Meira went to talk with her.|
21131|Continue to follow Meira, she might have the right idea!|
21132|The Electromagnetic Turret is already recharged, so you follow the soldiers of the Nudak Fortress and move to the middle of the barren well.|
21133|Operate the Electromagnetic Turret to deal with the enemy! The Turret has these skills: 
Pulse Wave (Normal Attack)
Railgun (Normal Attack against flying targets)
Magnetostatic Field (AOE Attack)|
21134|The enemies will attack you all from all directions. Please use the skills of he Electromagnetic Turret wisely to fend off these violent Robots!|
21135|The enemy's Robots have surrounded this place, and battle is on the verge of breaking out.|
21136|You indicate that the audio message is very clear.|
21137|The Berserk Bouncers have begun their attack, quickly use the "Pulse Wave" to shatter them!|
21138|The Butterfly Hoplites have joined the battle, use "Railgun" to attack them!|
21139|The Ballistic Bouncers have begun their attack, if there are too many enemies then use "Magnetostatic Field"|
21140|The soldiers have installed the last group of components onto the Electromagnetic Turret, it is now better able to deal with powerful enemies.|
21141|A fully-charged Electromagnetic Turret has four skills:
Methylidyne Cannon (Normal Attack)
Klystron (Medium Attack)
ICBM (Powerful Attack)
Superconductive Barrier (Defensive)|
21142|Following that, use the complete Electromagnetic Turret and defeat the last Gigantic Tyrant Robots!|
21143|Gigantic Tyrant Robot: Detecting... High priority target detected... Execute eliminating process.|
21144|The Gigantic Tyrant Robot comes near you - open fire! Do not be merciful!|
21145|Success! You've defeated the Gigantic Tyrant Robot!|
21146|When the Gigantic Tyrant Robots fell, the other Robots in the barren well stopped operating.|
21147|You've successfully helped the soldiers at the barren well defeat the ballistic robots.|
21148|In the meantime, your group should go back to the temporary stronghold at the barren well for a while.|
21149|You've been hit by the "Master Control Program" move! Next time, use the "Superconductive Barrier" to defend against it!|
21150|Gigantic Tyrant Robot: System... Fail, Execute... Self-destruct system...|
21151|Electromagnetic Turret: Detecting... driver is in danger, activate safety system.|
21152|For a long time we've been oppressed by the humans and can only live in this gloomy cave.|
21153|But the Human with the mysterious Cube appeared, and granted us new Strength.|
21154|And now, stronger than before, we are no longer afraid of you!|
21155|Enough! Let me show you the power of the Templars! Everyone, ready to attack!|
21156|The Templars started to attack the Sarpa Leader.|
21157|Just when you're ready to attack together, the Eidolon suddenly stopped you.|
21158|All in a sudden, a lot of Arachnids burst out from the front ground.|
21159|What the hell are these?|
21160|Ah! It's an ambush!|
21161|I feel terribly unwell......|
21162|The villagers gather at the entrance of the altar to thank you.|
21163|Kargula: Young one, accept the trial that I have for you; follow my guidance to pass the test.|
21164|Low furious roars resounding in the air: How dare you wake me up from a sleep that's hard to come by...|
21165|Rude humans, I shall make you pay for this!|
21166|Nine-Tailed Vixen, Kotonoha, said in a coquettish voice:  Looks like someone misses me...|
21167|Ohhhhh, I know everything that you guys are thinking about...|
21168|Which pathetic person is summoning me, and disturbing my well-planned journey?|
21169|Quick! Get it over and done with. Don't waste my time.|
21170|Hmm, chaos is the most primitive state. It's the same for everyone.|
21171|The foolish humans actually think they've grown so much that they can follow the norm. How naive is that?|
21172|Only those who have passed my trial have the right to see themselves as innocent.|
21173|Come and surrender yourselves, sinful people! Only then can I give you a chance to atone for your sins.|
21174|No matter how rigorous a challenge is, it is just a test. You don't have to fear.|
21175|You are only able to grow by overcoming the obstacles ahead. Come, show your true capabilities!|
21176|Ha, the lowly humans want to challenge me? As you wish; it's your death!|
21177|You really want to experience the death? Let me grant your wish!|
21178|Keep a devoted and kind heart always, and I will protect you.|
21179|As for you with evil intentions, you will be justly punished.|
21180|The insignificant humans want to take me on? You have truly overestimated yourselves.|
21181|You will see how much I deserve the title of Unrivaled Strongman!|
21182|You should immediately go down on your knees and worship me, the Great King!|
21183|Looks like I have to educate you on how to act like a respectful and submissive official!|
21184|Hahaha, I finally have the opportunity to show off my skills!|
21185|I've waited for this moment for a long time, stop this nonsense! Come over here and accept your death!|
21186|A deep low muttering comes from the distance, "Be prepared to die. Painfully."|
21187|I'll let you all experience, deeply, what it's like to not be able to live, and yet not die...|
21188|The Wolfmen in the camp have been successfully eliminated.|
21189|The attack ended after the bats jumped into the fire.|
21190|However, the way the bats jumped into the fire just now, almost as if it was against their will, has left you with a weird feeling.|
21191|The bats went into the Corpser Camp, under Mia's control, and completed the elimination mission.|
21192|The bat has three skills:
Wild Wing Slash (Ranged Attack)
Vampire for a Day (HP Absorbing Attack)
Squeaky Summons (Summons Allies)|
21193|Eradicate all the targets that Mia, the Right-Wing Butterfly, has marked in the camp, to complete this mission.|
21194|Bergen: Are you the person that Koral found to help out?|
21195|Bergen: I don't know what you guys have done at the Altar.|
21196|Bergen: However, since you dare to come here alone, I shall reward you amply!|
21197|Hmm, you are quite skilled. Let me see if you can pass this tough wave.|
21198|Koral: Don't be too arrogant, Bergen!|
21199|Koral uses magic on the Stone Golem, causing it to break into lifeless stone pieces.|
21200|Bergen: Koral, what have you done?!|
21201|Bergen: I'll let you guys see the absolutely invincible King of Stone.|
21202|Koral: It's pointless!|
21203|King of Stone loses its power and disintegrates into stone pieces.|
21204|Bergen: What did you do to the King of Stone?!|
21205|Koral: I've realized how your magic works, and have stopped its power.|
21206|Mmm...Looks like the door is ok. It just needs a little repairing, that's all.|
21207|Bergen: Grrr. No one should try to stop me!|
21208|Battle Zone|
21209|Bergen: I know who you are! I will be back!|
21210|Bergen quickly teleports away.|
21211|Koral: Beat the Stone Golem, and recover the Magic Core.|
21212|Koral arrived at the Altar right after you.|
21213|Quickly take the Magic Energy Core to the Altar in the southwest (60, 50).|
21214|By hiding in the Large Urn, Halton was able to sneak into the Mistwalker Camp.

Now he needs to avoid being spotted by the robots so he can recover the Ceremonial Tome and the Ceremonial Vessel.|
21215|Anthony the Craftsman gave Halton a few skills to help him sneak past the robots:

Harmful Interference will immobilize nearby robots, though they can still see him and sound the alarm.
Beam Me Up will transport Halton to wherever the Electroreceptor is.

|
21216|Halton's Electroreceptor can help find the Stolen Ceremonial Tome and the Ceremonial Vessel. Interact with it to begin its search.

When the Electroreceptor comes to a stop, look nearby for traces of the Tome or the Vessel.

If you get separated from the Electroreceptor, use the "Beam Me Up" skill to instantly transport to its location.|
21217|Halton retrieved the Stolen Ceremonial Tome and the Ceremonial Vessel successfully.|
21218|After meeting with the Foreman, Potter, the two of them left the Mistwalker Camp in a hurry.|
21219|Let's leave here, quickly.|
21220|Foolish villains, how dare you trick me! Now you die!|
21221|Please tell Faye this bad news!|
21222|After you've taken the Crescent Gem to the Altar, the people of Lunarin Village gathered at the Altar, preparing for the Ceremony.|
21223|Come come, I'm giving the Nectar Wine away for free today! Let's get drunk, everyone!|
21224|Let me perform the latest dance steps today.|
21225|You are the main focus of this Ceremony, please enjoy yourself to the fullest.|
21226|Even though I can't beat you in a fight, I won't lose a drinking contest! Let's compete and see!|
21227|All the villagers were talking; Potter had been challenged by someone.|
21228|In the distance, a tall man approaches. It seems to be Potter.|
21229|Potter launches a strike in your direction! Don't be careless!|
21230|The Church is looking for you because of the mutations of your body.|
21231|The Eidolon seems interested too; maybe you should look for a Templar.|
21232|The Starlight Treasure Chest has finally been opened, but the problem still cannot be solved.|
21233|You can't help but sigh. The Eidolon pats your back, seemingly tying to console you.|
21234|Lots of Carnivorous Marsh Lizards are nearby, making it rather crowded.|
21235|These Carnivorous Marsh Lizards seem very tense, like they aren't very accustomed to the local environment.|
21236|The Carnivorous Marsh Lizards are vicious; anyone who goes near them will be attacked.|
21237|There is Turtle blood on the Bat's teeth. Find the Turtle, and maybe some clues can be found.|
21238|The soldiers have already left for the Fernscall Woods. Quickly, go and assist them in their investigation.|
21239|I will be heading to the north to investigate. The southern path is all yours.|
21240|The Sarpa Leader was defeated, and the rest of the Sarpa fled in panic.|
21241|There are lots of blood-sucking bats wandering nearby. These bats should be domesticated ones.|
21242|There are many tents opposite the bridge. This should be the camp of the Corpser Bandits.|
21243|The soldiers will take word of the Corpser Bandits back to the village.|
21244|You have to eliminate Vampire Bats in the Corpser Camp first, so they won't cause any more deaths.|
21245|You are disguised as a Wolfman; now sneak into the camp and destroy the totem.|
21246|Mia gave you a small bag to repay you for your help.|
21247|Looks like there's something important in the bag. Take it to Anya as quickly as possible.|
21248|Lucas is a member of the original investigation team. You may find some news there.|
21249|Some investigators are in trouble on the east side of Fernscall Woods, right now. You need to help them first.|
21250|If the Unicorn Spirit has not been contaminated yet, it has an opportunity to recover.|
21251|After gaining the soul energy, examine it carefully. Bring the pure energy back.|
21252|Put the Unicorn Foals in the bag and come back as quickly as possible to protect their safety.|
21253|Put the body fluid of the Arachnid in the glass bottle, and then bring it to the researchers in Fernscall Woods for chemical examination.|
21254|Looks like the cause of the mutation is related to Candeo Core. Go ask the Village Chief about the situation in the Core.|
21255|To keep living creatures here from mutating further, you should clog the spring water's source.|
21256|Get into the Candeo Core of Candeo Marsh and close its water gate.|
21257|Alex asked you to go back and report the good news first. He needs to be alone.|
21258|Anya asks you to report the investigation results to the Grand Bishop.|
21259|The matter was successfully settled this time, but you still couldn't understand Alex's last response.|
21260|The six Magic Cores were scattered from Koral's hand.|
21261|A Possessed Stone Golem has appeared from the depths of  the Statue Ruins.|
21262|Looks like Bergen has found us. Please help me defeat the Stone Golem.|
21263|Several Stone Golems are approaching. Don't let them stop me.|
21264|Hang in there! I'll figure out the structure of this magic soon.|
21265|Just give me a bit more time. It's almost done!|
21266|The analysis is complete. Now I know how to use this magic!|
21267|Koral: It's not yet the right time to challenge Bergen. Retreat!|
21268|Continue to move forward with Meira.|
21269|Please defeat the Sprite's pet.|
21270|Give the flower crown to the sprite for his blessing, and then give it back to Meira.|
21271|Priestess: Wait! This is a sacred place. Not just anyone can enter!|
21272|Please give the Altar Flower to the Priestess, politely.|
21273|Sprite: So you are Meira and you are her assistant, right?|
21274|Sprite: Let's get started with the first trial!|
21275|Sprite: Later there will be Altar Dryads all over this place.|
21276|Sprite: Please use your keen observation to expel the discorded elements.|
21277|Sprite: The image represents a distinction between right and wrong, is also the basis for blessing marriage with harmony.|
21278|Sprite: That's right. Keep going to the next one.|
21279|Sprite: That's the spirit. One more left.|
21280|Sprite: You have passed this test. Now move on to the next challenge!|
21281|The Path ahead is open!|
21282|Sprite: The previous test was to test your wits. Now it's time to test your courage.|
21283|Sprite: Now you must challenge my pet to prove your bravery.|
21284|Sprite: Do not be fooled by its cute and disarming look.|
21285|Sprite: Congratulations on passing the trial! Please take the Flower Crown, and come up to the altar!|
21286|Please pick up the Altar Flower, and defeat the wild monsters which may appear.|
21287|Meira has finished making the Flower Crown. Please follow her to the Priestess.|
21288|Find three different Altar Dryads and defeat them.|
21289|Great! Dressing like this allows me to walk here unnoticed!|
21290|Halton hid inside the large urn, and managed to sneak into the Mistwalker Camp.
Now you need to stir up a commotion inside the camp to provide cover for Halton!|
21291|To avoid unnecessary loss, Koral asked you to come back.|
21292|Bergen ordered two Stone Golems to attack you.|
21293|Do you want to know the flavor of my lips? Come closer, hehehe.|
21294|Due to the power of the Gaia Cube, powerful Eidolons are descending. All Envoys of Gaia, please go to the Cube!|
21295|Bergen summoned a bunch of Stone Golems to attack you|
21296|Keep going deeper into the Ruins. I will catch up as soon as I figure out this magic.|
21297|After the joyful ceremony ended, you headed back to Lunarin to speak to the Village Chief. Hopefully he hasn't forgotten about the key he promised you.|
21298|Sprite: Wrong! Please observe more carefully!|
21299|Really experience this memory. Maybe it will inspire you.|
21300|After using spells, you felt dizzy.|
21301|The Toucant is firmly tangled in the rope you threw out. Take it back to the Village, and give it to Kara!|
21302|Emergency! Gotta let Drake know about this. Prepare to engage in battle if necessary...|
21303|The Crystal Ball was emitting dazzling light, but suddenly, something in the sky disrupted the magic.|
21304|As two mutually exclusive magics repulsed each other in the sky, Officiant Zujahla's silhouette slowly appeared!|
21305|How could this be possible... I was hiding in another dimension...|
21306|Humans! You are behind all of this, aren't you? You will have to pay the price!|
21307|As per Rachel's instruction, you now have to use the Blowdart Tranquilizer to paralyze the Dimetrodon.|
21308|At this point, the Eldest Prince took out a bottle of unknown Potion and drank it.|
21309|Juno piled up a little of the wood, then took out a flint to start a fire.|
21310|Badly injured, Roger was nodding at you and smiling gratefully.|
21311|Your hearts are filled with evil. You are all sinners!|
21312|The Electromagnetic Turret detected a threat, so it generated an electric wave to protect you and send you back to a safety zone.|
21313|If the Totem can absorb more energy, maybe we then can see its true power...|
21314|Oh!|
21315|Hold on... Movement up front.|
21316|The Sarpa Leader and its crew walked over from the distance.|
21317|So, you're the commander of these Sarpa? I thought you would all be hiding!|
21318|Again, brave fools invade our territory. You Human Beings just never learn.|
21319|Do you want to end up like the last humans who invaded?|
21320|Shut up! We Templars want you to pay for Lucas's death!|
21321|Demon: Hmph! Don't you even think of stopping my resurrection!|
21322|You did not pick up Ceremonial Vessel. Please check Backpack space and try up again.|
21323|Astaire Maledicto says, "Come back! You'll never get out of my territory!"|
21324|You successfully destroyed the Magic Barrier of the Corpser Bandits, and obtained the Totem.|
21325|While the Bandits were in chaos, you left the camp, still in disguise.|
21326|I've warned you so many times, and since you still don't learn, then I will deal with you myself.|
21327|Weak human like you, I can easily defeat you by myself!|
21328|Odum left to take the letter with him to the negotiation.|
21329|You haven't completed your mission yet. It's not the right time to go back.|
21330|Stop! How did you get in here?|
21331|What were the soldiers outside doing? How could they let someone get inside!|
21332|When the Guard saw Odum, the he stopped him immediately.|
21333|More Silverflash Guards appeared in front.|
21334|Stop him! We can't let him go near the Priest.|
21335|This Makar has great skills. Let's tackle him together!|
21336|He's all alone! Why can't we stop him?|
21337|Silverflash Guards surrounded Odum.|
21338|We can't let you move forward any more. We will do everything we can to stop you.|
21339|Enough! Everybody, stop!|
21340|The Varan Priest walked out, and ordered the guards to stop.|
21341|We've seen your strength.|
21342|I suspect you are not just here to fight. Tell me what you want.|
21343|Priest Shay agreed to negotiate with you. Hurry! Give him Analisa's letter.|
21344|After successfully making a peace agreement with the Silverflash Tribe, Odum came back to tell you and Analisa the good news.|
21345|After that, you went to the Priest to discuss what to do next.|
21346|Tell Fenrich about this discovery as soon as possible. Maybe you can get some clues from him.|
21347|Leonard: Oh, right. Quartermaster Lawrence needs someone to help him right now.|
21348|Leonard: Before you leave, go talk to him first.|
21349|Go out the fortress gate, and go west. Search along the cliff in the northwest.|
21350|These Varan keep moving goods from the North of Fulcheth Forest to the Village.|
21351|Quickly, go north and find out what they're transporting.|
21352|Analisa is still staying in Krok Village. You have to give her the sample.|
21353|Be careful with the Earth Guards outside the Village. They attack anyone who tries to go near them.|
21354|Supplies are in the fortress' warehouse. Deliver them to squad leader Walker at the barren well.|
21355|You have to destroy the outer armor of the Berserker Bouncers and Ballistic Bouncers first, then use the Removal Tool to remove their core.|
21356|You have to pass Forest of Thorns in the north, if you want to go to Tafay Village.|
21357|If you go north, you should be able to meet Vincent, who is out scouting along the way.|
21358|There are a lot of Robot Guards patrolling the periphery of Tafay Village.|
21359|You have to beat these Robots to enter the Village.|
21360|You have to go to Ghostweep Ruins, east of Tafay Village, and ask the Village Chief to stop their mining plan.|
21361|Remember to clear the howling wolves along the way, so that the villagers can evacuate safely.|
21362|The Village Chief went to Ghostweep Cave alone. You have to find him before something bad happens to him.|
21363|It is very dark inside the Ghostweep Cave. You have to use a Lighting Tool to enter it.|
21364|There must be a lot of zombies inside the cave. It's very dangerous for the Village Chief to be there.|
21365|Enter Ghostweep Cave, and bring the Village Chief out safely.|
21366|Not only the soldiers in the fortress, but also the Varan and the Dwarves want to join the battle against the Shadow Knight.|
21367|This will be of great help to future fights with the Shadow Knight's armies.|
21368|You were startled by the signs of someone coming.|
21369|Isn't he the man who was in my dream? I can't believe he is the Shadow Knight!|
21370|Come to your senses. I won't show any mercy!|
21371|Why have you asked people to run errands again? We have to focus on finding the truth, now!|
21372|What's the big deal? It's gonna take a while to get the results, anyway.|
21373|Besides, this might be connected to the event this time.|
21374|You put the poisonous bug inside the box while it's hurt.|
21375|Bring this poisonous bug to Penny!|
21376|Soon after you put the bait on the ground, there were loud footsteps nearby.|
21377|No more commotion! You've already drawn Wolfman's attention!|
21378|You heard a sound in your head, then saw a girl watching you nearby.|
21379|You have to get back some equipment from the Wolfmen before I can move on to the next step.|
21380|You quickly caught the bats in the bag while they weren't paying attention!|
21381|The bats are struggling in the bag. Take them to the camp entrance, quickly.|
21382|After the Bandit Leader was defeated, the camp became chaotic.|
21383|It seems that the Bandits will soon destroy themselves. You better bring the Totem back to Mia first.|
21384|You put the baby Unicorn into the bag carefully. It seemed very scared and kept kicking and struggling.|
21385|You've caught enough Unicorn Foals, take them back to Researcher Archie as soon as possible.|
21386|While the bug was injured, you put the body fluids coming out of the poisonous bug into the glass bottle.|
21387|The soldiers were ordered to follow you. Go to the gathering point in the Sarpa Abyss.|
21388|The Sarpa Leader is at the center of the Sarpa Abyss, giving orders to Sarpa outside Candeo Core.|
21389|You have to defeat the Sarpa Leader, before you can make your attack in Candeo Core.|
21390|Rebel Army Leader Micha kept his promise to surrender after you defeated him.|
21391|Micha lost, but he still showed his pride as a Makar in front of you. He went back to Ventos Tribe with his head held high.|
21392|Let Makar King Leo decide the rest...|
21393|The outcome of the contest was astonishing.|
21394|The Eldest Prince was poisoned by the Gnome's Potion. His body shrank abnormally.|
21395|So everyone went back to the Tribe, trying to find a way to save the Prince.|
21396|Oops! The previous fight has made the Dragon Beasts nearby extremely irritated. This is not good...|
21397|There are Curly-Tailed Chameleons hiding all over this place. The Bandits use them as like watchdogs.|
21398|This is the entrance of the Sand Owl Camp... The road ahead of us won't be easy...|
21399|Jonah was poisoned by Sand Owl bandits. Find a Poison Gland to save his life quickly.|
21400|The Antidote is completed. Hurry up! Inject the Serum into Jonah.|
21401|All the defeated guards and mercenaries have been escorted back to their camp by Sand Owl Bandits.|
21402|It seems that you have to break into the Sand Owl Camp to rescue them!|
21403|Sand Owl Knifemasters are searching for Freddie right now. We have to kill them all first.|
21404|Incredible... Caroline has become even more agile since I last saw her in Cactakara Forest.|
21405|Though you have a lot of things that you wanted to clarify with her, there's no way you two can continue talking under these sort of circumstances.|
21406|At least you've found the treasure map. Hurry up and bring it to Hayes.|
21407|The Exploration Team almost got lost in the Star Sand Desert, due to the mirages.|
21408|Looks like it's necessary to go to the Dune Outpost first, to find the Ozymand Temple...|
21409|Anyway, it's necessary to convince Desert Guide Akara to join the Exploration Team.|
21410|To solve the problem of the shortage of pack animals, you have to capture a strong Armordillo.|
21411|Akara asked you to take a sand shovel to the designated place, and dig up the buried secret.|
21412|(Exactly what plan does Akara have for that dragon egg?)|
21413|According to Akara's instructions, the two kinds of mucus must be poured into the Crystal Bottle. Ew.|
21414|To prevent Moas from rioting, Moa King Kakkan must be kept alive.|
21415|So you have to use the Blowdart Tranquilizer to paralyze it, so that you can gain Flower of Life successfully.|
21416|The things that Akara asked for are finally all here. Hurry up and give the cart to him!|
21417|Pick up a Thermal Crystal Bottle from the cart next to you.|
21418|Pour the liquid inside the Crystal Bottle onto the Flower of Life in order to get Particles of Life.|
21419|Drink the Essence of Life, and fill your body with vital energy.|
21420|Then, pour this energy onto the Dragon Egg, to help the baby dragon hatch!|
21421|After learning that the exploration team was attacked, Akara immediately leads you across the desert.|
21422|Enter the Ozymand Temple to catch the intruders first while the Exploration Team is still assembling!|
21423|The exploration has finally begun! Tell Hayes the good news.|
21424|The successful discovery of the Ozymand Temple has raised Hayes's prestige in the Sanknie Alliance.|
21425|Meanwhile, Hayes promised, on behalf of the Sanknie Alliance, to provide military supplies for the Church.|
21426|Go to Navea and tell the Grand Bishop the good news!|
21427|You will enter the periphery of the Ozymand Temple with Wrenna, and break the seal together.|
21428|To kill the four surrounding Seal Messengers and break the four Seals, you have to follow the instructions from the blue light on the ground step by step.|
21429|Only after the four Seal Messengers and Seals are destroyed, can you then deal with Gatekeeper Imadal.|
21430|Wrenna: "My name's Wrenna. Looks like you can hear me just fine."|
21431|Wrenna: "I am able to to communicate with humans like this."|
21432|Wrenna: "I can sense how special you are; the connection between us right now is quite strong."|
21433|Wrenna: "Follow the blue light on the ground. It will lead you along the right path."|
21434|Wrenna: "I've sensed the power of water from her..."|
21435|Wrenna: "You can break the first seal if you defeat her."|
21436|Wrenna: "Ah... Aah..."|
21437|Wrenna's pained wail made you a little nervous.|
21438|Suddenly, power surged into Wrenna's body, and the dragon stopped wailing.|
21439|Wrenna: Whew...  I'm feeling much better.|
21440|Wrenna: Now that the seal is broken, a part of my strength is awakened.|
21441|Wrenna: Now I can use a new skill, 'Calm Waters.'|
21442|Wrenna: Water can soothe, so it can decrease the target's attack power.|
21443|Wrenna: "Now, let's go break the next seal."|
21444|Wrenna: "This is a particularly malicious foe."|
21445|Wrenna: "Be careful. He's the second Seal Messenger that we need to kill."|
21446|Wrenna: "Oh, this darkness, this evil..."|
21447|Wrenna: "Aaaaah!!!"|
21448|Wrenna shook uncontrollably all over, appearing to be suffering an unimaginable pain.|
21449|Wrenna: Whew... Another part of my strength is awakened...|
21450|Wrenna: Now I can use a new skill, 'Breath of Darkness.'|
21451|Wrenna: Chaos is the purest power. It can ignore the enemy's defenses...|
21452|Wrenna: "...Attack it directly! Alright, hold tight..."|
21453|Wrenna: "His physical body is already dead."|
21454|Wrenna: "But he is still guarding the flame which symbolizes the meaning of life... How ironic!"|
21455|Wrenna: "Just kill him, and bring his misery to an end."|
21456|Wrenna: "Ah...hrrrg..."|
21457|You felt relieved that Wrenna didn't have as strong of a reaction this time.|
21458|Wrenna: Ah... I feel a limitless vitality.|
21459|Wrenna: Now I can use the a skill 'Fire of Life.'|
21460|Wrenna: The power of the flame can quickly repair my damaged tissues.|
21461|Wrenna: One last Seal to break, then we can go handle the Gatekeeper.|
21462|Wrenna: "The last one! I can't wait!"|
21463|Wrenna: "Now that the Seals are broken, I can't wait to deal with the Gatekeeper."|
21464|Wrenna: "Let's go! Finish off the last Seal Messenger."|
21465|Wrenna: "Uh... Whew... Don't worry. I'm already used to it..."|
21466|Wrenna: I am filled with the force of lightning...|
21467|Wrenna: Now I can use a new skill 'Temporal Phase.'|
21468|Wrenna: This power allows me to move through different dimensions to dodge any attack.|
21469|Wrenna: "So, the moment has finally arrived."|
21470|Wrenna: Let's kill the Gatekeeper and break the seal of the Ozymand Temple!|
21471|Everything around you starts to shake, as if a long-suppressed force was bursting out.|
21472|Wrenna: "We made it! We have broken the seal of the Ozymand Temple!"|
21473|Wrenna: "However, it's not time to go in yet..."|
21474|Wrenna: "There are still some things that we need to prepare. Let's get outta here first."|
21475|You and Wrenna successfully broke the seal of the Ozymand Temple.|
21476|But now it's still not time to enter the temple. Go back to report to Akara and Omar first.|
21477|Wrenna: I have a feeling that everything will come to an end, here, today.|
21478|Wrenna: The spirit in you is really unusual. I didn't expect that I could talk to you like this.|
21479|Wrenna: "So, let's get going."|
21480|Suddenly, a wave of strong Electromagnetic Energy surrounded you.|
21481|Gatekeeper: "Pathetic fools! How dare you take such liberties in front of me, the great Imadal?"|
21482|Gatekeeper: "Come here! I'm gonna make you regret what you have done today!"|
21483|Wrenna: Uh... I can't move.|
21484|You and Wrenna couldn't see anything but darkness. You were caught in a flux of powerful Electromagnetic Energy.|
21485|You've been pulled into another dimension.|
21486|When Darkness turns to Light, what is waiting for you...|
21487|A series of unexpected events have demoralised many subdivisions of the Alliance...|
21488|Maybe you should go to the medical team in the Camp and see if you can be of help there.|
21489|There is still a Mercenary Squad fighting with Marauders at Cracked Sand Plain. Hurry. Go join them, take supplies and provide assistance!|
21490|Near Krok Village|
21491|You found footprints, of both adults and children, on the ground.|
21492|You heard the sound of some kids talking, coming from the north. Zachary might be there.|
21493|After they finished talking, you heard a wolf howling in the west.|
21494|Big Bro, I'm so scared!|
21495|Big Bro, come protect us!|
21496|Don't worry. Zachary will protect you!|
21497|Near the Pool in Krok Village|
21498|Deep inside Krok Village|
21499|There are a lot of Guards around the Pool. They must consider the it very important.|
21500|There are a lot of guards patrolling the village. Looks like they're protecting someone very important.|
21501|You filled the Glass Bottle with water.|
21502|You find the water in the pool very clear, and filled with life, unlike the water in Oblitus Wood.|
21503|As you were on your way out, Quartermaster Lawrence waved at you over to him.|
21504|You used the Disassembling Tool to remove the Robot's core, leaving it motionless.|
21505|Thanks for your help. I can finally retreat.|
21506|You used Dwarf tools on ballistic Patrolmen, and successfully removed their Energy Device.|
21507|Thank you for letting me out. I gotta get out of here, fast. See ya.|
21508|After you activated the Robot, it sent out a loud alarm.|
21509|System booting... Large number of enemies detected. Launching an indiscriminate attack.|
21510|The ballistic Robot has a powerful shield. You can't inflict any direct damage on it.|
21511|The Robot is going crazy!|
21512|Go hide somewhere safe from the Robot's attack.|
21513|The ballistic Robot jerked a little and stopped moving.|
21514|People nearby saw the Robot stop moving and started to talk about it.|
21515|What exactly happened? The Robot became so destructive so suddenly.|
21516|You inserted the key and twisted it a little bit. The Energy Collector immediately stopped working.|
21517|While you were turning on the Lighting Device, the Village Chief suddenly came from the side and tried to snatch it away from you!|
21518|Alright... I give up. I'll follow you back.|
21519|When you let your guard down, the Village Chief suddenly snatched the Lighting Device from you!|
21520|I'm not giving up! I will find the new energy!|
21521|The Village Chief turned around quickly, and ran into Ghostweep Cave. You have to tell Sheo about this as soon as possible.|
21522|Don't get distracted by what's going on around you... Continue pouring the Power of Life into the Dragon Egg.|
21523|Something's happening! There's a dim light coming out from the Dragon Egg. Looks like it worked!|
21524|Wow... The Dragon Egg is actively absorbing my strength. I must hang tight!|
21525|Ugh... I can't focus... No... I cannot fall!|
21526|The time is now! Pour all the strength into Dragon Egg so that the Baby Dragon can be born! 
(Use Hotkey 2 to put your strength into the egg.)|
21527|A tiny Dragon broke out of the egg shell and stared at you with big eyes.|
21528|The Baby Dragon called out weakly. Take it to Akara, quickly.|
21529|Take the Baby Dragon to Akara|
21530|Once the Giant Armordillo slowed down, you were able to slip the reins onto it.|
21531|When the  Moa wasn't looking, you quickly caught it with a rope.|
21532|You poured Antidote into Jonah's mouth. The bitter taste brought him, gagging, to consciousness.|
21533|You put the fumigator down on the ground, and tried to tear open the seal on the cap.|
21534|Tarnation. The Bugs have found you, and are moving towards you!|
21535|The Bugs are making terrifying cries. Why is this blasted pesticide still not working?|
21536|Just at that critical moment, the pesticide started emitting pungent smoke.|
21537|The Bugs in front of you started wailing, as the smoke touched them.|
21538|The Bugs couldn't stand the pesticide and finally left...|
21539|Seems like these Bugs are very aggressive. You have to be careful with them in the future.|
21540|After a long time of hard digging, a you uncovered a giant egg.|
21541|Even though I don't know what kind of egg this is, it must be what Akara is looking for.|
21542|The defeated Hunters built a simple temporary camp here.|
21543|A scream came from somewhere nearby. The Scavenger Bird King is flying towards you.|
21544|The Scavenger Bird King spotted you near the bait and started attacking you!|
21545|The Scavenger Bird King gave out a shrill, pitiful cry before dying. The other Scavenger Birds fled in panic.|
21546|After using the spell, your body started glowing and everything around you turned blurry.|
21547|You felt your consciousness being pulled out of your body by some weird force.|
21548|Both Luther and Rebecca are very happy to see Bobby finally regain consciousness.|
21549|You took the opportunity to tell Bobby what happened.|
21550|The Mine Foreman spotted some outsiders approaching. He raised his weapon immediately.|
21551|We are already behind schedule this week. Don't disturb our mining work!|
21552|Just as you were leaving, Hamilton gave you a peculiar Device.|
21553|This is a Teleport Device. It was originally made for fleeing after spying on a place.|
21554|When you use this after you've completed your Quest, you can come back here immediately.|
21555|Just as you and Wrenna are heading towards the Gatekeeper...|
21556|Wrenna: "I'll fly you directly to the center of the Ruins."|
21557|Wrenna flapped her wings and took you to the center of the Ruins.|
21558|After she lands, just follow the Blue Light on the ground to find the third seal.|
21559|Wrenna: "Just like before, I'm flying you directly to the center of the Ruins. Hold tight!"|
21560|This time, it's obvious to you that Wrenna has become much stronger.|
21561|After Endora died, the sorcery that protected the Seal of Water disappeared.|
21562|Wrenna: "Now you can attack the Seal of Water. Go smash it!"|
21563|After Shenoute was defeated, the Seal of Darkness lost its magical protection.|
21564|Wrenna: "The seal is so weak without is protection. Shatter this evil thing!"|
21565|The force behind Yakubu disappeared, and the Seal of Fire revealed itself.|
21566|Wrenna: "You must destroy the Seal of Fire!"|
21567|Wrenna: "Great! The Seal of Lightning is back on our plane."|
21568|Wrenna: "Now we are able to hit it. Do it!"|
21569|Saimini: "Don't move, invader!"|
21570|The red flowers exude a marvellous fragrance, making you relaxed and comfortable.|
21571|After the Flower of Life has absorbed the liquid in the bottle, it starts to give off a strange dust.|
21572|Use 'Hotkey 1' on the dragon egg to infuse it with life energy.|
21573|There were a lot of powerful mirages along the way. If it Akara hadn't been leading us, we would definitely have gotten lost in the Yellow Sand.|
21574|After going over mountains and valleys, we've finally arrived at the expedition team's camp. From the mess in the camp, it's easy to see how brutal the monsters were...|
21575|The Seal itself is shining intensely, triggered by some kind of mechanism.|
21576|Odum is a brave and skillful Makar warrior. He has the following skills: 
Mantle Splitter (Heavy strike that can stun)
Lacerator (Slash at multiple foes)
Furious Warcry (Weakens nearby targets)
Survival of the Fittest (Restores HP)|
21577|As long as you use these skills properly, you can defeat Silverflash Guards easily.|
21578|Silverflash Guards have set up several checkpoints on the road.|
21579|You have to defeat all the Guards on the road in order to see the Varan Priest.|
21580|You have already defeated the Guards here. Move on to the next checkpoint!|
21581|Use the Resistor on it. It's the only way to stop it!|
21582|I've already told you, there's something wrong with the energy here.|
21583|We better get out of this scary place, quickly.|
21584|You opened the box, and found a marked map inside.|
21585|You found an old letter in the jar, but the receiver's address is too old and smeared to read.|
21586|Maybe the Postman can help.|
21587|My treasure... My treasure is gone!|
21588|Suddenly silence fell...|
21589|Perry started to enjoy the crab meatballs.|
21590|Looks like something's caught in the fishnet. Open it and take a look!|
21591|This traveler excitedly ran towards Petunia's stall.|
21592|This should be asked to Petunia, but you avoided saying it out loud.|
21593|Been turned down, but he was very polite. If only everyone was so polite.|
21594|It's just a flyer. Why are you so resistant?|
21595|Good deal? Stop kidding me. When we've accumulated one hundred pieces in total, we can still distribute the flyers together.|
21596|He's also an adventurous traveler. Here's wishing that his path will be smooth.|
21597|This traveler looks lost and a little afraid. What he's thinking?|
21598|Rather than staying here and do nothing, you might as well go buy some more equipment...|
21599|The ridicule in his tone would be obvious to anyone.|
21600|Finally managed to get a response. You are quite happy about it, and your steps lighten.|
21601|You were so touched, you blessed him from deep within your heart, and wished him all the best.|
21602|You sensed there's something weird in that sentence...|
21603|After some deliberation you chose a secondary weapon, and Andre gave you a crash course in its use.

He may not be a fan of your choice, but Andre does seem mildly impressed in how quickly you mastered the basics.|
21604|Since you have recently experienced different battles with Eidolons, you have a solid foundation for your combat skills.|
21605|Under Andre's instruction, you learned the basics of your newly-chosen weapon quickly.|
21606|You saw a small, sneaky figure wandering around. You'd better check it out!|
21607|Andy is running away! Stop him, so you can get the Ruby Necklace back!|
21608|Andy says, "No no no! I'm not giving you the Necklace!"|
21609|Tatius says, "Ok, let's get ready."|
21610|Tatius says, "You there, soldier, open the cage door!"|
21611|Tatius says, "Good job!"|
21612|Tatius says, "Leave the rest to me. You go back and report to Team Leader Andre."|
21613|Just these few men? Hahahahaha, I'll definitely win!|
21614|Die! Die! Death is the best ending you can hope for!|
21615|Your last words... Have you thought about them?|
21616|The Giant on the left stopped attacking. Looks like he has lost the will to fight.|
21617|The Giant on the right stopped attacking. He seems to have already given up on winning.|
21618|The Giant in the middle put down his weapon and stopped walking. They have all surrendered!|
21619|Giants are attacking from the center!|
21620|Giants are attacking from the right!|
21621|Byron: "Hello, I'm Byron, a disciple of Analisa the Divine Blacksmith."|
21622|Byron: "Even though Analisa clearly knows that I'm most afraid of riding on animals, she asked me to be a tour guide. Why would she do that?!"|
21623|Byron: "Don't mind me, I'm just venting. Analisa actually takes very good care of me. I've learned so much from her."|
21624|Byron: "Here is the Stall Area... It is between the Central Round Square and the Trade District; a lot of traffic comes through here."|
21625|Byron: "Adventurers from all over the world prefer to set up their stalls in this area. Here, they can exchange their various wares among themselves."|
21626|Byron: "Ouch!"|
21627|Byron: "... Please be good, Ostrich. Can you run a little bit more steadily...?"|
21628|This is the hub that connects the Central Round Square and the Trade District. Adventurers love to set up their stalls here.|
21629|Byron: "Here is the Trade District. It's the main commercial area for the residents here. When you walk down this way, you can find the auctioneer, the banker and different food merchants."|
21630|Byron: "Hmm..."|
21631|Byron: "Ostrich, bro, you're such a live wire, but could you... Oh noooo! There's a hole there... ARGHHHHH...!!"|
21632|The Trade District is the main area for auctioneers, bankers and different food merchants.|
21633|Byron: "This high-rise structure is called the Sky Tower. There are many legends surrounding this Tower--it seems that there are various strong and terrifying monsters inside, or there are lots of magic weapons hidden inside... Maybe both."|
21634|Byron: "Some people even say that the top of the Tower is an entrance to Heaven. But ordinary residents are not allowed to enter, so no one can prove it. It's really very mysterious..."|
21635|Byron: "Hey!"|
21636|Byron: "Oh... Great. An even more active Ostrich and an even bumpier ride. This is really what I need, isn't it?"|
21637|The Sky Tower, full of legends and mysteries, is a forbidden place that no ordinary folks can trespass.|
21638|Byron: "Have you seen this grand and magnificent structure? This is the Castle Church."|
21639|Byron: "Castle Church is the residence of the incumbent Grand Bishop, Belenus. He also does his work in this place."|
21640|Byron: "Hmm... Why do you have a comfortable saddle and I don't? This isn't fair..."|
21641|Castle Church, the main administrative area in Navea. The Grand Bishop and other High Priests live here.|
21642|Byron: "We're now in the center of the Navea. A lot of merchants set up shop here."|
21643|Byron: "The merchants here sell various weapons, armor, groceries and secret stones."|
21644|Byron: "Ostrich, bro, you... Nevermind. I have no energy to complain anymore..."|
21645|Central Round Square is a gathering place for merchants of weapons, armors, groceries and secret stones.|
21646|Byron: "We're now in the military district. Um... don't be too loud. Team Leader Andre seems to be reviewing troops right now."|
21647|Byron: "Oh, he's standing in front of the hall, looking so majestic and solemn. That's Andre, the leader of the Templars."|
21648|Byron: "He's a very respected Templar. As long as he assumes personal command in Navea, all its citizens can live safely."|
21649|Byron: "Ahh... Ostrich, bro, it would be great if you could let me explain peacefully..."|
21650|The Military Hall has always protected Navea from harm.|
21651|Byron: "Oh, I'm going to throw up soon..."|
21652|Byron: "Indeed, I really envy adventurers like you. Now and then, I'd like to see the outside world, too."|
21653|Byron: "Analisa would never let me do it. She's always so worried about me, ha..."|
21654|Byron: "Hmm... About what I've just said, please don't get me wrong..."|
21655|Byron: "It's actually really great to be around Analisa. I've learned so much from her."|
21656|Byron: "Analisa may seem very direct and intimidating at times, but she's actually a very gentle person!"|
21657|Byron: "Will you come back often? If so, could you spare some time and visit Analisa and me?"|
21658|Byron: "Come and share your adventure stories with me. I think Analisa will love to see you, too!"|
21659|There are many people injured at this post. Many Hunters here have nearly lost their combat capability.|
21660|The temporary base of the Hunters' search and rescue team, now trying to find the Roger's missing units.|
21661|Front Line Guard Post. Soldiers here are monitoring the situation around Deep's Cavern, as ordered.|
21662|Hunters' Command Post for the operation against Stone Hammer Giants. The Hunting Band Leader and elite hunters are all stationed here.|
21663|The game bird struggled intensely as you put it into the bag.|
21664|At that moment, a powerful magic barrier appeared at the entrance of Deep's Cavern.|
21665|Such a strong magic spell can't be cast by just anyone.|
21666|All of a sudden, you felt a powerful familiarity...|
21667|This feeling seems to be the same as the Power of Gaia on you...|
21668|In a moment, you realized the feeling was coming from a girl not too far ahead of you.|
21669|Hunters' Mountain Village|
21670|New Moon Hunting Grounds|
21671|Beast Statue Altar|
21672|Argus Cult Church|
21673|Stone Hammer Tribe|
21674|Ancient Lair|
21675|Argus Hunter's cottage. Argus Village hunters gather here to handle the animals that they've caught.|
21676|Avians' residential area. Their daily necessities can be seen everywhere.|
21677|Agora in Argus Village. Elders and bigwigs of the Village reside in this high-class area.|
21678|Deep in Northern Forest|
21679|Weird. Ever since you got into the forest, you keep having the feeling that there's some invisible person watching you...|
21680|Suddenly, a powerful magic wrapped around your legs! This... you can't even move your fingertips...|
21681|Hmmph! This makes no sense!|
21682|Ever the hypocrite, Belenus.|
21683|In an instant, a dark shadow leaps forth, brandishing a baleful blade.|
21684|After that man appeared, a feeling of despair swept over the entire hall.|
21685|Discomfort and anxiety reigned over the throng. Those weaker in constitution have been fainting at an alarming rate.|
21686|The Grand Bishop chanted a prayer, and a holy light enveloped Gus and the nearby soldiers.|
21687|As he looked on, the Shadow Knight drew back his lips in a cold sneer.|
21688|As the Shadow Knight spoke, your heart sank into your chest and you closely observed the Grand Bishop's face.|
21689|You saw only serenity in the Grand Bishop's countenance as he waited for the Shadow Knight to finish speaking.|
21690|The Grand Bishop, his words tinged with anger and frustration, conjures a holy light to sear the demon.|
21691|The Grand Bishop raises his pitch, and a rare, slight expression of agitation played on his face.|
21692|The strange spell cast by the Shadow Knight made the crack in the abyss yawn even larger.|
21693|This time, a hulking mass of a creature stepped forth from the abyss.|
21694|You hear the sound of footsteps, and the door open as someone else enters the hall.|
21695|The Shadow Knight took a look at Andre, smiled contemptuously, and left through the door.|
21696|At this moment, Andre caught sight of you.|
21697|Andre says, "You! What are you waiting for? Help us!"|
21698|For the safety of Navea, defeat this monster with Andre!|
21699|The Infernal Demon suffered extreme pain, and prepared for one last counterattack before dying.|
21700|The Infernal Demon bellowed, his roar shaking the very walls of the hall.|
21701|The Infernal Demon cast a powerful shockwave at the Grand Bishop.|
21702|Grand Bishop! Watch out! Andre cried.|
21703|Without a second thought, you darted in front of the Grand Bishop, hoping to block the attack.|
21704|Vile monster! Taste holy steel! shouted Andre in vengeful anger.|
21705|The Power of the Light poured into Andre's sword. He raised the sword and, with all his might, slashed downward...|
21706|Finish off the Infernal Demon.|
21707|The colossal demon collapsed before the light. A hushed peace fell over the hall.|
21708|Alain opened the manuscript and checked its contents.|
21709|A Time Travel Device? I actually used to believe we could make something like that, when I was a kid.|
21710|The Flying Device, though... That looks like we might actually be able to build one.|
21711|Alain became more and more fascinated, completely indulged in his own world.|
21712|The silhouette of the ghost slowly disappeared, and vanishing front of your eyes.|
21713|You have the feeling that there's a weird gaze on you again! You stopped, looking around cautiously...|
21714|You watched around with sharp eyes, and then took your weapon in your hand!|
21715|What... What's happening? What's this sudden thunder?|
21716|Ahh... Such a strong spell! Blast it... Who the hell is this?|
21717|What kind of joke is this? I can't be captured just like that, without a fight!|
21718|You gasped a bit, then dared the ghost to bring it on.|
21719|Be careful! The ghost is going to attack you!|
21720|Though you wanted to keep chasing the ghost, right now you have to collect medicine for Roger as fast as you can.|
21721|Eidolon: "I think... the call is coming from the gigantic Blue Crystal."|
21722|After you hear what the Eidolon said, you slowly approach the Blue Crystal.|
21723|Suddenly, the Blue Crystal starts to make a loud, droning noise, absorbing energy at the same time.|
21724|An intense light appeared not too far off the ground, and a huge sound came from the sky.|
21725|Then huge creatures descended from the sky, one after another, to stand in front of you.|
21726|Each of these creatures exudes great power, and stares at you quietly...|
21727|The Blue Crystal's shining light starts fading away, as if it is waiting for you to connect with it.|
21728|You can only shoot the Bow and Arrow once. Try using it to hit both the targets at the same time!|
21729|You feel dizzy, and weak all over.|
21730|Sterling started to train the four Turtles.|
21731|I will definitely train them to stand on their own legs as a Turtle Beast.|
21732|However, before the training starts, I should name them first...|
21733|I'll name this one Nader... this one Darwin...|
21734|Sterling started to put serious effort into naming the Turtles.|
21735|You filled the bucket with the spring water from Sarpa Abyss.|
21736|Take the spring water to Penny.|
21737|You injected the antibody into the Unicorn, and it seemed to work.|
21738|The Unicorn didn't resist, and stayed by your side quietly.|
21739|You injected the antibody into the Unicorn, but it turned even more aggressive!|
21740|Let me show you my way of dealing with the Demon, after this.|
21741|Please close your eyes first.|
21742|Once you close your eyes, you feel Slick poking and prodding at you.|
21743|Great! It worked!|
21744|When the Demon sees you, it will be scared away.|
21745|I always scare others off with this trick. It never fails.|
21746|I'll dig the treasure up right away, and if there's anything good, I will definitely share with you.|
21747|Exedore dug quickly, revealing a trove of white pearls.|
21748|These are the pearls collected by the Sarpa! We're gonna be so rich!|
21749|Suddenly, a white pearl exploded. Lots of small bugs came from inside it.|
21750|I'll pack up this flower right away... Ouch!|
21751|Luke was accidentally stabbed by the flower, and the flower was stained with a bit of his blood.|
21752|Luke, I heard that you were looking for me?... What's in your hands?|
21753|Isn't... Isn't this a Marriage Flower!? I can't believe you went to the marsh and found it!|
21754|No... Actually, it's...|
21755|There is blood on it! You risked your life to get me this flower!|
21756|That's why this is...|
21757|Kurt started to set off for the Village. Quickly, keep up with him and protect him.|
21758|Wolfmen and their bats have appeared! Come and save me!|
21759|Here, we'll be safe. Thanks so much for your help!|
21760|After saying that, Kurt began to walk to Candetonn.|
21761|You put the bait on the designated spot.|
21762|Before long, a huge rhino came around.|
21763|You hoisted the Makar flag.|
21764|Oracle soldiers have shown up to destroy the flag! Protect it!|
21765|That's it! This is my Braided Rope! You really saved me!|
21766|The morale of the Makar has been significantly boosted by the flag!|
21767|The Priest has given you a blessing. You should visit all the altars!|
21768|You feel the strength of the rhino's soul.|
21769|You feel the strength of the wolf's soul.|
21770|You feel the strength of the hoofbeast's soul.|
21771|The Jerboa ate too much and couldn't move. You catch it easily and put it in the bag.|
21772|A female Makar suddenly came walking out.|
21773|I heard you have lost my Braided Rope?|
21774|No! Sweetheart, it's right here!|
21775|Nico hastily showed the female Makar the Braided Rope he just pinned on.|
21776|Hmmph! Glad it's not lost. I actually thought that you wanted to go against me.|
21777|I wouldn't dare! I love you, my dear, I've never ever thought of anything like that!|
21778|Ok then. If you really lose that Braided Rope, you'll be in trouble, I swear.|
21779|Yaluda let out a deafening roar into your ears.|
21780|You tied the exhausted rhino tightly with the Rope.|
21781|The rhino soon gave up struggling.|
21782|You set a fire to the rhino's tail. It ran off in pain and fear.|
21783|Shortly after that, sounds of startled and panicky Gnomes echoed out from Oracle Camp.|
21784|The wolf ate the drug-injected meat, and soon fell asleep on the ground.|
21785|You easily put the sleeping wolf into the bag.|
21786|To rescue the captive, you have to be disguised as the General's Assistant.|
21787|The Makar captive started to follow you.|
21788|You have to ensure the safety of the man with you, otherwise the General will blame me for not taking good care of the accused.|
21789|Great, you're safe!|
21790|So you are here to rescue me... Thank you so much.|
21791|Moloko salutes you, showing his gratitude.|
21792|A Sacred Power dashed at the Demon, and halted it in its tracks.|
21793|The quickest way to find out if there is a problem with the spring water is to conduct an experiment on humans.|
21794|Penny poured the spring water into the cup.|
21795|Alex, you've been so busy lately. Drink some water and take a break.|
21796|Thank you. I've always thought that you only cared about the research. I didn't realize that you can be this nice.|
21797|Alex gulped down the water.|
21798|Oh, my stomach doesn't feel so good.|
21799|Alex rolled on the floor in pain.|
21800|Hmm... Looks like there really is a problem with the spring water. I need to examine it carefully.|
21801|I'll never eat anything you bring me again...|
21802|After eating the waterweed, the Teenage Turtle fell into a deep sleep.|
21803|You cut the Shaggy Hoofbeast's Mane adeptly.|
21804|Munroe made the jerboa take the potion.|
21805|The jerboa's body suddenly became smaller!|
21806|The jerboa that has become smaller escaped from the gap of the cage and disappeared.|
21807|I didn't think about the possibility that it could be the kind of potion that can make the body smaller. I'm too careless.|
21808|Now I have to catch another jerboa.......|
21809|Violent splashes come from the pool, as if something huge and powerful is rising from the water!|
21810|Help move the Iron Armordillo Egg.|
21811|Capture the greedy Dizzy Thieving Rex.|
21812|Teach Ancient Panthera survival skills.|
21813|Help subdue the Giant Mountain Dragon.|
21814|Oww! That really, really hurts!|
21815|I feel much better now...|
21816|Hurry up with the cure! I wanna get up and fight!|
21817|Justice... shall... prevail...|
21818|Mhm... Looks like you've recovered quite well!|
21819|If you've been injured, try to rest! Or you'll take longer to recover.|
21820|Holy Light, rain down your healing power upon your followers! Cease their pain!|
21821|Vile monster!|
21822|Go to hell!|
21823|Kill!|
21824|Justice will triumph!|
21825|Feel the Holy Light, and be gone!|
21826|Go die! May you never have to repeat this path in your afterlife.|
21827|I'll never lose to a monster like you!|
21828|You're gonna pay for our dead brothers with your life!|
21829|Arrghhhh!|
21830|Curse...you...|
21831|Ha ha...Kill...|
21832|So...Ugly!|
21833|I'll... kill... you...|
21834|Rumble... Kill... Aah...|
21835|Oww! That really, really hurts!|
21836|Granny starts following behind you. Help her find her way home!|
21837|Now, are we heading left or right?|
21838|Ruth: I remember... There was a large, round square on my way here. Maybe I can remember more if we get there first.|
21839|I am sure I was here... But my memories before this are still a blur.|
21840|There is a fountain in the south. I seem to be very familiar with that area.|
21841|Right, it's here! I remember, this is the place I always come to.|
21842|Here comes an old man.|
21843|My wife! I finally found you!|
21844|You were just here resting... But all of a sudden you were gone! I've been worried sick!|
21845|I went to.... Where have I been? I can't remember it at all.|
21846|Don't worry. You are alright now, that's all that matters. Let's go home.|
21847|I can't believe you could actually find this place. Impressive!|
21848|Great. I'm so bored here. Finally it's over.|
21849|I don't wanna play it anymore either... I almost fell asleep.|
21850|Finally, it's over. I'm exhausted.|
21851|Don't play Hide and Seek next time. The city is way too big.|
21852|I agree.|
21853|Let's play other games.|
21854|You try it on this Wooden Dummy first.|
21855|You use the weapon in your hands to attack the Wooden Dummy.|
21856|Nice move, but you can try to hit it harder.|
21857|You try again to attack the Wooden Dummy.|
21858|Very good. Now use your full strength to attack the Wooden Dummy.|
21859|You've destroyed the Wooden Dummy!|
21860|...It seems that I have nothing more to teach you.|
21861|Laura's Bakery, in the Trading District. Newly opened!|
21862|Guaranteed delicious! If you miss it, you'll regret it!|
21863|A new bakery? I need to go have a try.|
21864|Laura's Bakery! The best bakery in the city!|
21865|Just go to the Trading District. You won't miss it!|
21866|A new bakery? As someone who loves cakes, I won't miss it!|
21867|Delicious cakes! In Laura's Bakery!|
21868|Special discount is offered if you buy the cake now!|
21869|Sounds pretty good! Let's go buy some, later.|
21870|When you light the match, an old woman suddenly appears next to you.|
21871|Are you my grandma!? You passed away a long time ago. I can't believe my eyes!|
21872|Wendy, it's time to go home for dinner.|
21873|Ok, grandma, let's go home.|
21874|Wendy left with her grandma.|
21875|The famous Sky Tower is over there. It's said that the tower has been there for a very long time.|
21876|In the south, the main gate of Navea. The gate leads to Crescent Hill.|
21877|Next to it is the Central Round Square. People can buy weapons, armor, Secret Stones and all the other essential items for adventurers there.|
21878|Heh heh...hey there, girlie! Why don't you come have some fun with me.|
21879|S-stay away! Don't come any closer or I'll scream!|
21880|Hahaha. Scream your lungs out, cutie. No one's gonna swing in and save you.|
21881|Heeeeeeeelp!|
21882|That girl is being harassed by a drunkard. Hurry and save her!|
21883|You gave the drunkard a sound thrashing and drove him off.|
21884|Thank you so much. If you hadn't shown up, I don't know what would've happened.|
21885|The girl smiles and waves as she leaves.|
21886|You lift the Fishing Rod and start fishing by the lake.|
21887|You feel like you caught something.|
21888|After you pulled the fishing rod, you find out you've caught a small cloth bag.|
21889|Great! That's my money bag that fell in the lake!|
21890|Taz puts the Cloth Bag in his pocket immediately.|
21891|Thank you! Now I gotta go now. Bye.|
21892|Everybody, pull yourself together!|
21893|It's a tough road ahead of us, but we have Andre leading us. We shall overcome all difficulties!|
21894|Right!|
21895|Death to The Shadow Knight!|
21896|Everlasting Light!|
21897|Stall Area|
21898|Trade District|
21899|Sky Tower|
21900|Castle Church|
21901|Central Round Square|
21902|The Military Hall|
21903|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill, "Calm Waters."|
21904|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill, "Breath of Darkness."|
21905|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill "Fire of Life."|
21906|Wrenna's strength is awakening; she has learned a new skill, "Temporal Phase."|
21907|After you arrived, you noticed the giant Blue Crystal on the altar that you are familiar with.|
21908|When you approach it, the Blue Crystal starts shining, as if it's responding to you.|
21909|After that, all kinds of energy gather slowly in the sky. There are shining beams of light all around.|
21910|The Eidolons that appear in front of you are much more powerful than the previous ones. They gaze at you quietly.|
21911|The Blue Crystal's shining light starts fading away, as if it is waiting for you to connect to it.|
21912|The Grand Chief of the Mistwalker Tribe has deployed a large number of troops. The whole temple is now heavily guarded.|
21913|We still have to stop them from destroying the temple's seal, no matter what it takes!|
21914|The Grand Tribal Chief himself is standing on the platform in front!|
21915|Odum: "Warriors, guard the gate! No one must get in to disrupt me!"|
21916|Odum: "No...No! I want that power! Give it to me, now!"|
21917|Odum: "Enough... I... I surrender... I surrender to your power..."|
21918|The temple starts shaking from its foundations. It seems that the Seal will soon be broken.|
21919|The temple shakes again. In the blink of an eye, the Seal Stone of Alabastern Temple crashes into the ground!|
21920|The light of the Sealed Stone is now completely gone, but the deafening roar still echoes inside the temple.|
21921|A giant monster appears from the smoke and haze in front of you!|
21922|I'm back... I can't believe those ingrates sealed me away!|
21923|Now... The whole world is gonna pay!|
21924|Odum: "Young man, let me, Odum Ryan, help you!"|
21925|Odum waves the Gigantic Axe in his hands and charges the giant monster from behind!|
21926|Huh... huh... I finally caught up with you... This place... This place is amazing!|
21927|Bring it on! I will show you what I, the Grand Tribal Chief, am capable of!|
21928|After you passed through the Candeo Core, a vast valley opened up in front of you.|
21929|The Water Purifier you set up earlier is floating quietly on the side...|
21930|Noripan: "You are not allowed to enter... You have to die!"|
21931|Fia: "Intruder, leave. You can't come in here!"|
21932|Fia: "It seems that our warnings have been ignored... Noripan! Don't let him pass through."|
21933|Augustus: "Hey! Wait for me. I rushed here as soon as I heard the news!"|
21934|You hear Augustus' hasty footsteps coming from behind.|
21935|Security Alarm: "Invaders! Red Alert! Red Alert!"|
21936|Security Alarm: "All citizens, take shelter immediately. All Policebots, converge on target!"|
21937|Odum: "No! You greedy human... Give my strength back!"|
21938|Odum: "I'm gonna kill you...Kill you!"|
21939|I've done what I am supposed to do. This is the only way I can leave here without shame.|
21940|Now you get outta here as fast as you can. By the way... Tell people in Lunarin that I'm sorry.|
21941|Kayel the Protector: "Protection Order Executed. Block pathway to ensure public safety..."|
21942|Kayel the Protector: "Pathway confirmed blocked. Start searching for intruders..."|
21943|Kayel the Protector: "Intruder found! Execute final warning."|
21944|Kayel the Protector: "This is the final warning. Leave! Or you will be forced to leave."|
21945|Fia: "Enough! I've lost the last of my patience!"|
21946|Kayel threw out an incendiary bomb. The bomb exploded among the fallen trees.|
21947|The trees are burning in the raging flames...|
21948|Fia: "You broke into our territory, ignored my warnings..."|
21949|As a way to repay you for saving its life, the Recovered Wolf has decided to follow you.|
21950|A giant turtle is walking here, slowly.|
21951|It must be the Turtles' leader. Go defeat it!|
21952|Show the human our true power!|
21953|Defeat this human!|
21954|I can't believe our leader was defeated by a human! We gotta report this to the queen!|
21955|Our leader has been defeated. Run!|
21956|Go tell Anya what you learned from the Village Chief!|
21957|The minute you set foot in this place, you had a strange feeling about the cave.|
21958|You've noticed that all the living creatures in this Candeo Core have evolved to a state that is more powerful than you could have imagined.|
21959|Now all you can think of is to join Alex, and close the water gate as soon as possible, to prevent the disaster from getting even worse.|
21960|You look around, and notice that something is wrong. Go to the red arrow and check.|
21961|You can see some marks on the ground, but they are not very clear. Go on to the next spot and have a look.|
21962|They seem to be footprints, but it's hard to tell which kind of creature they belong to. Go on to the next spot and have a look.|
21963|The marks here are very clear. They were made by a human. Alex must have been here.|
21964|At this moment you notice that there are a set of footprints heading to the opposite direction. It looks like Alex has left.|
21965|Follow these footprints, and you should be able to find Alex.|
21966|Abyss Patroller: "I smell something annoying..."|
21967|Abyss Patroller: I smell something annoying...|
21968|Abyss Patroller: "The queen has said that, except for that guy, no human is welcome here!"|
21969|Abyss Patroller: The queen has said that, except for that guy, no human is welcome here!|
21970|Abyss Patroller: "So... Go to hell!"|
21971|Abyss Patroller: So... Go to hell!|
21972|Alex: "Hey! I'm here!"|
21973|You're good to go! Draw the Sarpa's attention to you, so that Alex can finish his mission.|
21974|Sarpa Queen: "A Human... I've just chased away one, who would've thought another would come?"|
21975|Sarpa Queen: A Human... I've just chased away one, who would've thought another would come?|
21976|At this point, you hear faint, melodious music.|
21977|You have a very weird feeling, because the music seems to be coming from your own head.|
21978|You begin to wonder just how powerful the Sarpa Queen might have become in this cave.|
21979|Alex is ready to detonate the dynamite, as soon as the Sarpa Queen falls.|
21980|Alex: "The timing is perfect! I'm detonating the dynamite, so watch out!"|
21981|The timing is perfect! I'm detonating the dynamite, so watch out!|
21982|The dynamite exploded, blocking the flow of water here.|
21983|Just when everything was peaceful again, a powerful force swept through the Candeo Core!|
21984|The Shadow Knight glanced at you. You can't read his eyes.|
21985|Haha! Not a smart move! Did you really expect to catch us off guard!?|
21986|Don't fight it. Just let these Arachnids eat you all!|
21987|After saying that, the Sarpa Leader and her crew headed into the Sarpa Abyss.|
21988|The poisoned soldiers are being attacked by the Arachnids. Go defeat the bugs, and rescue the soldiers!|
21989|After defeating all of the Arachnids, you helped the poisoned soldiers return to the village for treatment.|
21990|You can't leave yet! Defeat the Arachnids and rescue the trapped soldiers!|
21991|Fia: "Now you will never leave here... ever!"|
21992|The path ahead is completely blocked. Looks like you'll have to turn back.|
21993|Qulun: "Brothers, we have the people from the church surrounded!"|
21994|Qulun: "Let's make the final moments of their lives as painful as possible."|
21995|Qulun: "Ha! Couldn't handle me on your own? Bring whatever help you want; I'll cut you all down!"|
21996|Ha! Couldn't handle me on your own? Bring whatever help you want; I'll cut you all down!|
21997|The strange eggs lining the room have begun quivering and cracking. This can't be good.|
21998|I was curious who was chasing me, but I wasn't expecting it to be just a kid.|
21999|You think you can stop me all by yourself? Don't make me laugh!|
22000|Don't underestimate the power held in my Archaic Tome!|
22001|I call for your aid, Lord of the Otherworld! Titanus!|
22002|Titanus! Destroy him!|
22003|Maggie! You're under arrest for murder, espionage, and treason!|
22004|Hah! Hypocrites.|
22005|Take her to Navea. Let her stand trial.|
22006|Yes!|
22007|There is an unsettling hissing sound coming from afar. It sounds like a gigantic insect.|
22008|Up ahead, someone is running away.|
22009|It's Maggie! We need to get rid of these monsters quickly so we can catch up to her!|
22010|Who's there, Maggie called as she stopped running.|
22011|The Magic Circle vanished, and in its place stood a gigantic and horrifying creature!|
22012|Vic...Victoria! No...|
22013|Adjutant, read the charges against her.|
22014|I never imagined the traitor could be within the Ministry itself...|
22015|Adjutant, let's get out of here.|
22016|Hey!|
22017|You hear Maggie screaming.|
22018|Alex: "Good work! Keep drawing her attention!"|
22019|Good work! Keep drawing her attention!|
22020|Alex: "I gotta make it work this time..."|
22021|I gotta make it work this time...|
22022|Alex: "Just a bit longer! I'm almost ready to detonate the device!"|
22023|Just a bit longer! I'm almost ready to detonate the device!|
22024|Sarpa Queen: "Such a rude little intruder. Did you think I wouldn't notice you?"|
22025|Such a rude little intruder. Did you think I wouldn't notice you?|
22026|Sarpa Queen: "I can sense everything that happens in these waters."|
22027|Sarpa Queen: I can sense everything that happens in these waters.|
22028|Sarpa Queen: "Don't think for a moment that you can get away with harming my people."|
22029|Sarpa Queen: Don't think for a moment that you can get away with harming my people.|
22030|Sarpa Queen: "You've got guts, busting in here and stirring up trouble. Now it's time for you to pay."|
22031|Sarpa Queen: You've got guts, busting in here and stirring up trouble. Now it's time for you to pay.|
22032|Sarpa Queen: "There are severe consequences for angering me. I will make you regret ever coming here."|
22033|There are severe consequences for angering me. I will make you regret ever coming here.|

22070|The Shadow Knight has left, and the sense of overwhelming pressure is gone.|
22071|The giant shell nearby seems unnatural. You may want to be vigilant.|
22072|The bizarre plant in the bushes nearby is giving off a weird smell. You may want to be vigilant.|
22073|There seems to be something staring at you from the bushes, not far away. You may want to be vigilant.|
22074|Standing among the flowers nearby is one unusually large flower. You may want to be vigilant.|
22075|There's a weird mound of woodblocks and other stuff nearby. You may want to be vigilant.|
22076|The bright flower not far away seems demonic. You may want to be vigilant.|
22077|That stinky flower bud seems abnormal. You may want to be vigilant.|
22078|The egg sac in the bushes seems weird. You may want to be vigilant.|
22079|Suddenly, the earth started shaking as a powerful force intruded on this sacred land!|
22080|Dragon Outsider: "Arrghhhh!!!"|
22081|Aelius: "T'was rash of you to set foot upon this soil, fiend."|
22082|A loud voice resounds as the Knight of the Sun steps forth, ready to challenge the fiend.|
22083|Aelius: "Tsch...it seems this fiend has reserves of power I did not anticipate...."|
22084|Sigrun: "Hang in there! We've got your back."|
22085|Two more powerful spirits have joined the fray!|
22086|Yarnaros: "It takes a monster to best a monster, and now, you've met your match."|
22087|Sigrun: "Grr...this one's not going to go quietly into the night..."|
22088|Aelius: "Perhaps we ought combine our might!"|
22089|Yarnaros: "Now you're speakin' my language!"|
22090|Using their divine power, the three Eidolons subdued the Dragon Outsider and sent it back to the Otherworld.|
22091|Aelius: "Many thanks for your help!"|
22092|Yarnaros: "Much obliged. I'll catch you on the flip side."|
22093|Sigrun: "Farewell!"|
22094|Farewell, old friends! We shall fight together again another day!|
22095|The forces have dispersed and the monster has been defeated. Peace has returned to the sacred land.|
22096|Para Ryan: "It can't be delayed any longer. We gotta restore the seal as fast as we can!"|
22097|It can't be delayed any longer. We gotta restore the seal as fast as we can!|
22098|The Second Prince, Para Ryan, can't wait any more and rushes into the temple all by himself.|
22099|But because the seal is broken, Wrathborne Temple has been occupied by monsters.|
22100|In front of you is the Temporal Golem, one of the Protectors of the temple.|
22101|Temporal Golem: "Destruction comes along with my hands... Flames of war come along with my footsteps..."|
22102|Destructions come along with my hands... Flames of war come along with my footsteps...|
22103|Temporal Golem: "I am gonna destroy it all!"|
22104|Temporal Golem: I am gonna destroy it all!|
22105|Para Ryan: "Hmm? It's the Holy Unicorn from the temple..."|
22106|Para Ryan: Hmm? It's the Holy Unicorn from the temple...|
22107|At this moment, you hear the Second Prince roaring from afar. Apparently, he is fighting monsters.|
22108|Your arrival has triggered some mechanism. The light from a Long Distance Beacons falls around you.|
22109|You are just in time! Help me knock it down!|
22110|The Steed fell to the ground. Its eyes calmed, and slowly lost their shine.|
22111|Second Prince took the orb out of his robe, planning to use it to restore the temple's seal.|
22112|The orb's power is circling, directing the surrounding energy to gather in the center.|
22113|The seal is restored! It's complete and full of energy. You've done it!|
22114|It seems unusually quiet. Just when you had started becoming uneasy at the quiet, several enemies appeared and restrained you.|
22115|They look like Disciples of Light... But they are giving off an ominous air. They have been corrupted by a dark force.|
22116|You have been restrained by an evil force, preventing you from moving. However, you feel your own strength begin to build up deep inside of you...|
22117|Suddenly, a great force burst out from you, breaking the restraints!|
22118|You can feel power swirling around inside of you, ready to burst out at a moment's notice.|
22119|The foul air is dispersing, making way for a pure and divine energy.|
22120|The Wrathborne Soul turns to you with a smile and a look of approval.|
22121|How... How this possible? I can't believe that the Lord of the Otherworld would...|
22122|Go!|
22123|Hmph! Don't be so cocky, Victoria.|
22124|You should get out of this place as soon as you can; monsters are already on their way here.|
22125|Robinson: "Onward! Everyone Advance!"|
22126|Robinson's troops are trying to break through the Avian's defenses to get further into the cave.|
22127|Zaunna: "No one is allowed to pass before the Demon God has regained his strength!"|
22128|Zaunna: "He's come through? ... You two, go deal with him!"|
22129|Useless imbeciles! It seems I will have to deal with you myself.|
22130|Watch out! The eggs are emitting a toxic gas.|
22131|The Brooders heard you approaching and have retreated underground.|
22132|Suddenly a bunch of panicked larvae sprung up from out of the ground!|
22133|With a cloud of dust, a giant insect came bursting up from out of the ground!|
22134|Maya: "I knew you wouldn't let me down. Well done!"|
22135|Let's see... Zaunna would have brought that treasure here.|
22136|Maya took something from the treasure chest and cradled it in her arms.|
22137|Hahaha... It's here! I've been searching for it for so long...|
22138|What's with that rumbling? Why is the ground shaking? Are those footsteps?|
22139|You can feel a warm wind blowing towards you. There is a cliff in front of you!|
22140|Everything is shaking violently. A huge monster has climbed up the face of the cliff!|
22141|The Water Purifier you set up earlier is floating quietly...|
22142|The land is full of peaceful nature, but you sense an uneasiness in the air...|
22143|A gentle breeze comes up, comforting you with cool and refreshing air.|
22144|But even this is not enough to settle your nervousness upon entering the land of the Makar tribe.|
22145|The Makar greet you with arrogant and unwelcoming glares.|
22146|It is obvious in their demeanor that most Makar despise humans.|
22147|You remain steadfast despite the suspicious looks, and continue making your way to the residence of the Makar King.|
22148|Shalen: "Hold on a second." It appears a female Makar wants to speak with you.|
22149|Shalen: "How did it go?"|
22150|It's a surprise to meet you here. Then again, perhaps not. Perhaps it is the hand of fate that has brought us together.|
22151|I have been busy with my special training. Allow me to demonstrate just how strong I have become.|
22152|Helakar attacked you immediately after he finished speaking.|
22153|There seems to be something buried underneath the dune.|
22154|By carefully digging, you reveal a dragon egg.|
22155|The question continues to bother you while traveling to meet Merle.|
22156|I need to pick some Dragon Bell Grass. I need you to protect me.|
22157|Stay close! I'm afraid there will be lots of dangers along the way.|
22158|Dragon Bell Grass is rare, but I'm hopeful we will find some.|
22159|There is some! Pick it, and lets continue looking.|
22160|Another one! Be quick, it's not safe here!|
22161|I think this is all we can hope to get this time.|
22162|Let's keep going.|
22163|Let's head back.|
22164|Para Ryan: "How dare you defile the temple! I will destroy you!"|
22165|Para Ryan: How dare you defile the temple! I will destroy you!|
22166|Para Ryan: "Once the seal is restored, you all are getting locked up!"|
22167|Para Ryan: Once the seal is restored, you all are getting locked up!|
22168|The scent of blood overwhelms you the moment you set foot inside the cave.|
22169|You must find and destroy the terrible force inside to prevent the Oblitus Wood from withering.|
22170|Something strange is going on up ahead. Go check it out!|
22171|A giant lizard is devouring the remains of a Stray Butterfly Fairy that wandered in here by mistake.|
22172|The Ghostweep Chameleon has noticed your presence. He still seems to be hungry...|
22173|Ghostweep Chameleon: "Ssss..."|
22174|A few Butterfly Fairy Survivors managed to escape from the bowels of the Ghostweep Chameleon.|
22175|The Butterfly Fairy Survivors gave you their blessings. You can feel a refreshing aura enveloping you.|
22176|You sense a foul air all around you. There must be a powerful enemy nearby.|
22177|Tafay Chief: "I'm here... behind the bushes!"|
22178|Tafay Chief: I'm here... behind the bushes!|
22179|The Ghostweep Ruins fill with an evil aura as the Duke of the Beyond appears.|
22180|Duke of the Beyond: "Hah! Intruders!"|
22181|As the Duke of the Beyond stepped to the center of the hall, all of the energy in the air condensed into him.|
22182|Odum Ryan: "Let me help you!"|
22183|Odum Ryan: Let me help you!|
22184|Duke of the Beyond: "Ah, you've brought a friend. Excellent! This ought to be fun!"|
22185|Duke of the Beyond: Ah, you've brought a friend. Excellent! This ought to be fun!|
22186|Duke of the Beyond: "It would be a shame to send you to the afterlife alone. The two of you can keep each other company."|
22187|Duke of the Beyond: It would be a shame to send you to the afterlife alone. The two of you can keep each other company.|
22188|As the Duke of the Beyond collapsed, the whole of the Ghostweep Ruins began to shake.|
22189|Footsteps can be heard all around as the hall fills with people.|
22190|Butterfly Fairy: "Thank you, human. We would certainly be dead if not for your aid."|
22191|Butterfly Fairy: "Please accept our blessings. May the Spirit of Nature guide you."|
22192|With the temple sealed for so long, the creatures inside have evolved far differently than those outside.|
22193|Be careful around the Holy Beetle Eggs. They are putting off a strange toxic gas.|
22194|Up ahead, you catch a glimpse of two shadowy figures as they ran into the room on the left.|
22195|Your attention is drawn by approaching footsteps. Omar has arrived with his Expedition Team.|
22196|Suddenly, the two shadows reappeared. It's an ambush! Everything goes dark...|
22197|When everyone came to, they noticed that the Sand Gem was gone!|
22198|Quick! You need to catch up to Caroline before it's too late!|
22199|Suddenly there is a severe earthquake. Could it be that the gem's power has been released?|
22200|Helakar: "Ah! Ha ha ha! Such wonderful power!"|
22201|By unleashing the Sand Gem, Caroline has made her Eidolon incredibly powerful.|
22202|Helakar is overflowing with powerful energy. He appears completely manic.|
22203|Akara: "We're too late!"|
22204|Talamund: "No! This can't be! I was supposed to be immortal..."|
22205|As thanks for your aid, the Recovered Wolf has decided to join you.|
22206|The Second Prince might not be able to deal with all these monsters by himself. You should catch up to him and keep him from getting in over his head.|
22207|Today, he gave up on justice. Defeat him and put him out of his misery.|
22208|The Second Prince was careless, and got himself caught in a trap.|
22209|The road is littered with the bodies of monsters. It appears that they were defeated by the Second Prince.|
22210|Para Ryan: "Aaaaaaah! You attacked me!"|
22211|Para Ryan: Aaaaaaah! You attacked me!|
22212|Para Ryan: "Hey! I'm not the enemy!"|
22213|Para Ryan: Hey! I'm not the enemy!|
22214|You hear the sounds of heavy fighting. The Second Prince is near!|
22215|The Second Prince is fighting the frenzied beast up front. Go help him defeat it!|
22216|Soon you will be gone from this earth! Let the cursed fires of hell feed on your sadness!|
22217|Nudak Fortress|
22218|Fulcheth Forest|
22219|Krok Village|
22220|Barren Well|
22221|Forest of Thorns|
22222|Tafay Village|
22223|Ghostweep Ruins|
22224|Aside from emitting a low humming sound, the seal doesn't seem special in any way.|
22225|The zombies are performing some kind of ritual. A strange and unsettling energy is filling the air.|
22226|Their bodies start to twist and change. You get the feeling that something bad is about to happen.|
22227|With a burst of light, the zombies evolved. They have become far more powerful... and far more ugly!|
22228|Even though you have destroyed the Ghostweep Ruins Magic Source, you feel that the Ruins is not yet safe.|
22229|The Grand Mistwalker Elder has brought his clan to the hall.|
22230|Fia: "My kind warnings meant nothing to you?"|
22231|Noripan: "This is as far as you can go... Human..."|
22232|Security Alarm: "The City Square has been taken. All citizens, please take refuge in the temple."|
22233|Security Alarm: "The whole city will be under martial law. Repeat. The whole city will be under martial law."|
22234|Kayel the Protector: "All pathways in the temple will be blocked."|
22235|Kayel the Protector: "Pathway blocking confirmed. Switching to Annihilation mode."|
22236|Kayel the Protector: "All creatures outside the temple will be destroyed."|
22237|Kayel the Protector: "Annihilation mode activated. All creatures will be destroyed."|
22238|The Marauder Miners are mining the spar greedily. The sound is echoing in the dark Mine Pit...|
22239|Qulun: "Pull yourself together! Don't let the work be disrupted!"|
22240|Qulun: "Just bring it on... My blade will slash you in half!"|
22241|The deeper inside the mine... The denser the ferocious creatures are...|
22242|The zombies in front are performing an evil Blood Sacrifice...|
22243|It gives people terrible feelings...|
22244|A low, roaring sound is coming from the deep side of the cave.|
22245|The Argus Cult has strengthened their defenses. There are well - equipped guards everywhere.|
22246|Zaunna: "Guard the passage for me. No one is to pass!"|
22247|Zaunna: "Stop them now! It's an order!"|
22248|With the Secret Order in hand, you sought out the tent belonging to leader of the pirates.

However, when you tried to enter the tent, you were stopped by a Catseye Herald.|
22249|After you talked to him and showed him the Secret Order, the Cat's Eye Herald finally agreed to set up a meeting  with the Pirate Leader.|
22250|You asked the pirates, straightforwardly, where Selena was.|
22251|Adjutant Follower: "Oh... You are here looking for that girl... She was brought to our headquarters. Hahaha."|
22252|Adjutant Follower: "As for you... I'm not in the mood to deal with you. Now get the hell outta here!"|
22253|Caroline: "Hahaha! Stupid guys. Thanks for helping me find the Gem. I didn't even have to do too much!"|
22254|Caroline appeared ahead, briefly. Go catch up with her!|
22255|Helakar ignored Caroline's calling, and attacked you on his own.|
22256|Helakar was defeated, and the spiritual power faded. Caroline's Guiding Spell was reversed.|
22257|Both Helakar's and the Sand Gem's power rushed back to Caroline.|
22258|Caroline couldn't handle these two powerful forces. There was an explosion, and all that was left of her was ashes.|
22259|Talamund: "I, have awoken from a long, long sleep with all my immortal strength."|
22260|Talamund: "It's good to have you here to witness my return. Especially you..."|
22261|Talamund: "Wrenna...The Dragon of Salvation in the prophecy, my nemesis."|
22262|Talamund: "Let's face our fate together..."|
22263|Talamund: "I, Talamund, will sever this annoying fetter once and for all!"|
22264|After entering the room, you witnessed the Chief Guardian kill the man you just saw.|
22265|You notice that these creatures are rattled. Apparently, someone entered earlier and spooked them.|
22266|The damage on this cart seem pretty new. Looks like someone is trying to take something out of here.|
22267|You've got the information you need, so...|
22268|It's bad news, but still, Madeline must know about this...|
22269|From now on, you have to be Haas's guard. Try to keep him from getting hurt.|
22270|There's no need to come here again... Just leave this place.|
22271|Joshua's Reservation|
22272|Joshua's Reservation|
22273|Suddenly, you feel an overwhelming pressure upon you.|
22274|The Miracle Rock Monster has exploded into pieces. Pick up the fragments, now!|
22275|The fairy flies away, crying.|
22276|You made a note of the distinguishing features of the Demarech Mine District.|
22277|You made a note of the distinguishing features of Caerment Altar.|
22278|This place has lost its sacred power. Without the seal, the temple now can no longer restrain the monsters.|
22279|This place has turned into a monsters' haunt. The sense of sacredness the temple once had is now gone.|
22280|The bodies of dead monsters and fallen guardians are evidence of a fierce battle here.|
22281|Numerous Disciples of Light have been killed by the influence of demonic force, some even have been corrupted, and turned into demons themselves.|
22282|Breaking in has triggered the temple's defenses. Several Columns of Light have appeared around you.|
22283|The Columns of Light are gathering energy. You feel that they might be summoning some sort of creature.|
22284|The light faded, revealing a Holy Unicorn. However, it seems to have been corrupted by the demonic air in the temple, as it's expression is violent and frantic.|
22285|It doesn't deserve such a tortured fate. Best to put an end to its suffering.|
22286|You see a group of Disciples of Light up ahead. They seem to be arguing with one another.|
22287|When you finally reached the peak of the temple, you noticed a commotion being made by a group of Disciples of Light.|
22288|As the argument grew to a fever pitch, one of the Disciples lashed out and killed the others.|
22289|With the rest of them gone, the remaining Disciple of Light emits a staggering energy. The demonic air disappears, and the temple becomes tranquil.|
22290|Frederic: "Oh? It appears I have an audience. Come out, let me see you."|
22291|Frederic: "You really shouldn't struggle. You look so... ugly... when you struggle!"|
22292|Frederic: "I could just kill you outright, but where is the fun in that?"|
22293|Frederic: "I'll give you one chance to fight for your life. Make good use of it!"|
22294|You see some crystal fragments along the road. They still have a tiny bit of their energy remaining.|
22295|The energy seems to have come from an Eidolon that is in the process of transforming.|
22296|Sand Owl Elite: "Look out! We need to protect Captain Helakar!"|
22297|Look out! We need to protect Captain Helakar!|
22298|Aah... Such power...|
22299|You can do nothing but watch as Helakar transforms.|
22300|The energy swirling around Helakar has reached critical mass. It collapses on Helakar and dissipates, revealing him transformed into a new form.|
22301|I am glad you are all here. You can now witness my newfound strength!|
22302|As Helakar crumpled to the ground, the energy that had transformed him started to escape. He reverted back into his original form, but energy continued to pour out of him and he collapsed.|
22303|Chief Guardian Murfeo is stationed here. He has sworn that he will not let anyone pass.|
22304|Talamund: "I, the Immortal Talamund, have awoken from a long, deep sleep."|
22305|Talamund: "This world may have changed while I was sleeping..."|
22306|Talamund: "But you humans remain as pitiful as ever."|
22307|Talamund: "That you were able to make it here changes nothing."|
22308|Talamund: "Now, face your inevitable death. That is your punishment for coming here without my permission!"|
22309|Helakar is up ahead. It seems likely that all this foul energy came from him.|
22310|FFCG01.ogv|
22311|Finally! I've found the last silver coin. Now I can lift this wretched curse!|
22312|Now that I have been freed from these shackles, I can enact my revenge on this world!|
22313|Wait! Who is that behind you?|
22314|I suspected that there was a spy among us. That is why I set this trap.|
22315|Today is the day you die!|
22316|The Sneaky Villager waved when he saw you approaching.|
22317|You've caught a Forest Beetle! Now you can go back to Bella's Orchard and challenge Donny.|
22318|You've done a lot of promotion in many places! You should visit Laura and see if it has worked.|
22319|Only three minutes left! You must deliver the goods before time runs out.|
22320|Time is up! You failed to deliver the goods before the deadline.|
22321|This is the Residential Neighborhood. They say the residents here are the happiest people in the world.|
22322|The Bank of Navea is up ahead. You can tell how well business is by the number of people out in front.|
22323|To the south is the main gate of Navea. Going through there will take you to Cresent Hill.|
22324|This is the Residential Neighborhood. They say the residents here are the happiest people in the world.|

22350|I remember there being a square with a big fountain near my home. There was also a tall gate nearby.|
22351|Rose: This isn't it. I have never been here before.|
22352|You have found all of the children. You should give this news to Mick.|
22353|You have strayed too far from the Anemometer, and it has been destroyed by monsters.|
22354|This suit of armor may be old, but it is the right size. I only need to make a few alterations...|
22355|Reboot complete. Several functions cannot be restored. Booting into Safe Mode.|
22356|I can't just take off by myself. I need to wait for Potter.|
22357|Halton: I can't just take off by myself. I need to wait for Potter.|
22358|We haven't retrieved everything yet. I can't leave like this.|
22359|Halton: We haven't retrieved everything yet. I can't leave like this.|
22360|You've found Allen. Tell him that Mick has given up.|
22361|You've found Leah. Tell her that Mick has given up.|
22362|You've found Kate. Tell her that Mick has given up.|
22363|You go find the others. I'll join you guys later.|
22364|I waited for so long, and all I got is the news that he's gone...|
22365|I have no regrets. At least now I know he always loved me.|
22366|Your beetle looks pretty good, but mine's still better.|
22367|Come on out, beetle!|
22368|Donny's beetle slowly climbed out.|
22369|You've caught a big one! Isaac the Fisherman will want to take a look at this.|
22370|This... This reminds me of Silverash Shores.|
22371|This is incredible! It makes me feel like I'm really at Silverash Shores.|
22372|You have finished repairing the fence.|
22373|Drew took a small pillow out of the package.|
22374|My pillow! I can't sleep well without it.|
22375|Drew happily clutches his pillow.|
22376|Help is finally coming! Let's be ready to get out of here!|
22377|Yes!|
22378|Aye!|
22379|A giant robot has appeared in front of you.|
22380|Unidentified Targets! Switching to "Elimination" Mode!|
22381|I'll deal with this robot. You all go on ahead!|
22382|We can't just leave you alone!|
22383|We're a team!|
22384|Ah, thank you. Let's deal with it together, then.|
22385|Yes! We've beaten it!|
22386|Thanks! Because of your help, we were able to retreat.|
22387|We are on our way back to report to the General. I hope we meet again someday!|
22388|Heinrich and his men left.|
22389|You absorbed energy from the Ballistic Butterfly Hoplite with the Energy Collector.|
22390|The Energy Collector is full. You should bring it to Mulrooney in Tafay Village.|
22391|I'm surprised it went this well. I'll see if it works right now.|
22392|Mulrooney emptied the contents of the Energy Collector in to his machine and started it|
22393|The machine buzzed and whirred to life.|
22394|It's doing something, but it sounds a bit odd...|
22395|With a shudder and a thunk, the machine crashed to a halt. Black smoke began to billow out of it.|
22396|Wonderful. Looks like it won't work after all. I need to think of another way...|
22397|I'm saved! I've been going crazy!|
22398|Lamarr put on the hat.|
22399|This is so much better! This really cuts down on the glare and the noise!|
22400|Thank you. Now I can treat these people.|
22401|Perrin ground the herbs with a mortar and pestle, then fed them to the Poisoned Militiaman.|
22402|Wha- What happened to me?|
22403|The Wounded Militiaman regained consciousness.|
22404|It worked! Thank you so much! This will allow us to treat a lot of people.|
22405|You notice a human kid talking to a Varan.|
22406|Why do you have all of those scales?|
22407|The Varan doesn't reply.|
22408|Can I be as tall as you are?|
22409|...|
22410|I'm hungry! Do you have any candy?|
22411|This kid won't shut up! Will you take him away from here?|
22412|Oh, are you taking me to my mom?|
22413|Sidney starts following you.|
22414|Sidney's mom should be in Nudak Fortress by now. You should bring him there.|
22415|Mom!|
22416|Finally, you've come back! The Varan didn't hurt you, did they?|
22417|No, they were nice to me! But some of them seem unhappy...|
22418|It doesn't matter. All I care about is that you're safe.|
22419|Look at all these carts. All I have to do is hide in one, and they'll never be able to find me.|
22420|Dwight has hidden himself in a cart.|
22421|Now I can get out of here easily.|
22422|How come there is a cart here?|
22423|I don't remember putting one here.|
22424|Does it matter? Just take it to Krok Village.|
22425|Yes, sir!|
22426|...|
22427|It's time to go to work.|
22428|Just bring this Energy Detector along. It will show the energetic levels of the surrounding areas.|
22429|The Energy Detector is showing an unusually high level of energy near here.|
22430|Unbelievable! That cave is emitting huge amounts of energy!|
22431|If we can harness that energy, we could run the entire village!|
22432|The device is working properly.|
22433|Nothing out of the ordinary. Continue detecting.|
22434|The Desert Jerboa noticed that someone was approaching, and it scurried off into the desert.|
22435|You need to catch it before it notices you.|
22436|Is that the legendary Desert Jerboa? Let me see!|
22437|Boris peeks into the sack to get a closer look at the Desert Jerboa.|
22438|The Desert Jerboa leaps out of the sack and runs away.|
22439|Shoot, that's the third time I've done that! Quick, after it!|
22440|As soon as Bermuda took the Small Skeleton from your hands, a Little Triceragon appeared.|
22441|Bermuda threw the Small Skeleton.|
22442|The Little Triceragon is happily chewing on the bones.|
22443|Huh.  So the Small Skeleton works after all! So much for that theory...|
22444|With a happy smile, Tia tied the flower in her hair.|
22445|I'm definitely going to be the talk of the ball tonight!|
22446|Oh! Is that Tia? Are you still preparing for tonight's ball?|
22447|Sharon waves her hands about as she speaks, deliberately showing off her elegant jewelry.|
22448|I'm almost done! I'm really looking forward to tonight.|
22449|Tia flips her hair, showing Sharon the Desert Flower.|
22450|Hmph!|
22451|Tee hee!|
22452|Blast! I need more accessories! I can't lose to the likes of her...|
22453|The nest is right up ahead. Let's go!|
22454|As you approach the nest, you are confronted by an angry Rex.|
22455|There it is again! Get rid of it!|
22456|Even with it's injury, the Rex still refuses to budge from in front of the nest.|
22457|Hmm. I suppose that must be the mother.|
22458|Let's leave. We can't blame her for wanting to protect her young. I will continue to study them from afar.|
22459|You've come across a strange compass. It's needle is pointing towards the entrance to the Sand Owl Camp.|
22460|The compass needle has begun pointing to the south.|
22461|The compass needle has begun pointing to the west.|
22462|The compass needle has begun pointing right at Isaias.|
22463|You've found the legendary Star Sand Compass! That's awesome!|
22464|All I need to do now is inlay this Star Stone into the compass, and then it will point me right to the Star Sand's Secret Treasure!|
22465|After Isaias inlaid the Star Stone into the compass, the needle began to spin wildly.|
22466|After a few moments the needle stopped spinning, and pointed to the northeast.|
22467|Looks like the treasure is that-a-way! I'm off! I'll repay you after I find it!|
22468|Now's our chance! The bandit's treasure trove is at the bottom of this cliff! Let's head down there while the bandits are away.|
22469|This is it! This is where I saw the door open when they spoke the password!|
22470|Sesame Cookies!|
22471|... Nothing is happening.|
22472|What? How... I'm sure that's the password.|
22473|You hear footsteps and voices approaching.|
22474|Oh no, the bandits are on their way back! Quick, hide!|
22475|Those sesame cookies we had last time were pretty good, but not great. Maybe today we should order some takeout.|
22476|I'm feeling like lamb. You want lamb? Let's get a nice roast lamb.|
22477|One of the bandits removed a key from his pocket and opened the hidden door. The two of them kept chatting about food as they stepped inside.|
22478|A key? There wasn't a password at all! Boy, is my face red...|
22479|That's the Tiny Pyramid! Excellent! Now all we need to do is insert this into the proper spot at the altar.|
22480|Morris inserted the Tiny Pyramid into the triangular hole in the altar. After a moment, he altar began to make strange noises.|
22481|System Booted. Please Enter Your ID Code.|
22482|ID Code? What does that mean?|
22483|Invalid Entry. Activating Defenses.|
22484|A hush descends on the altar as several demons blinks into existence.|
22485|A trap? Run!|
22486|Upon closer inspection, you notice that one of the cactus flowers looks different than the rest.|
22487|I didn't expect you to find me so easily! That's right, I'm the Mysterious Cactoid!|
22488|Are you looking for the Mysterious Cactus Fruit? I'm afraid I can't allow that.|
22489|You have found all of the team members. Report back to the team leader!|
22490|I lost... Here, you have earned this cactus fruit.|
22491|Is this fruit from the Mysterious Cactoid? It looks just like any other cactus. I suppose we won't know until someone eats it.|
22492|The Desert Jerboa has been snared. Go capture it!|
22493|Marvin wolfed down the entire cactus fruit in a single bite.|
22494|Hmm... This flavor...|
22495|It tastes the same as any other cactus fruit!|
22496|Inside the treasure chest is a note: "Under the Gaze of the Giant Dragon."|
22497|It sounds like a clue. You should try and find a place like this.|
22498|After you read the note, it dissolves into sand and is blown away by the wind.|
22499|There is an oddly shaped mound nearby.|
22500|Buried in the mound is a note: "In the Shadow of the Great Tower."|
22501|After you read the note, it dissolves into sand and slips through your fingers.|
22502|There is a small box hidden in the shadows.|
22503|Inside the box is a note: "The Pouring White Sands."|
22504|After you read the note, it evaporates into a flash of starlight.|
22505|There is a small cloth bag tucked into a rocky crevice.|
22506|What? The team's being told to report in?|
22507|But... I haven't healed yet! I need to stay in the hospital for, um, for observation!|
22508|You're fine! You've already been here for weeks longer than you needed to be. Stop distracting the doctors and the other patients and go back to work!|
22509|Let's keep going. We should be able to get better data up ahead.|
22510|Yes! I'm on my way!|
22511|What? I thought I still had three days of vacation time! Ugh, fine, I'll go.|
22512|I have to report this to the Village Chief right away!|
22513|Yes, three desserts and two bottles of wine. To go, please.|
22514|Okay, I'll go back to work. I've been bored to death anyway.|
22515|I'll just go now. Bye.|
22516|Good luck and be careful!|
22517|Great! Everyone is here.|
22518|Pack up your gear and your necessities. We meet at the gate in half an hour.|
22519|Yes sir!|
22520|Sigh... Looks like I have to leave Camilla again.|
22521|Is there a problem, Kasim?|
22522|No, sir! I'll go get ready right away.|
22523|Thanks for all of your help! Looks like we might actually be ready to face some battles soon.|
22524|The trap is all set. Now you just need to lure a Mountain Dimetrodon into it.|
22525|A Mountain Dimetrodon got caught in the trap.|
22526|As thanks for releasing me, I can grand you three wishes!|
22527|...at a very reasonable price, of course.|
22528|There it is again! I can't let it damage my goods!|
22529|Help me...|
22530|Sidney: Mom packed up and left in such a hurry that she forgot to take me with her!|
22531|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Sonjuno was defeated.|
22532|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Kayel was defeated.|
22533|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Titanus was defeated.|
22534|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Argus was defeated.|
22535|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Asheara was defeated.|
22536|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Frederic was defeated.|
22537|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Talen was defeated.|
22538|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Talamund was defeated.|
22539|The rhino is resting after eating all of the bait. Now's your chance!|
22540|The rhino is going berserk!|
22541|Help!|
22542|Everybody run!|
22543|Note: You need the Dimensional Crystal Key to enter the Dimensional Corridor.|
22544|Three Dimensional Shackles can be found in the Dimensional Corridor. You will need three Dimensional Crystal Keys to open them all.|
22545|Western Shackle is unlocked. Power is flowing to the Enchanted Stone.|
22546|Northern Shackle is unlocked. Power is flowing to the Enchanted Stone.|
22547|Eastern Shackle is unlocked. Power is flowing to the Enchanted Stone.|
22548|All three Shackles are unlocked. The Enchanted Stone begins to glow¡K|
22549|A Magic Circle appears on the ground. A gate is about to open¡K|
22550|The Dimensional monster has come through the gate! You must destroy it!|
22551|The monster has fallen. The unstable energy in the air is settling.|
22552|Tell the Mage that you've destroyed the Dimensional monster.|
22553|The Young Sarpa is happily following you, hoping it will get more food.|
22554|Yes! My research has finally paid off!|
22555|The Unicorn nods its head at Charlie, as if it's trying to say "thank you."|
22556|These Unicorns are intelligent creatures after all! I need to work hard to save as many as possible.|
22557|Ew, Bug Eggs! I cant stand those little menaces.|
22558|I finally understand just how you feel about me. Let's go get married!|
22559|Nina... Hear me out...|
22560|Nina takes Luke's hand as they head off toward the village.|
22561|Penny, the Scholar's Assistant in Candetonn, must be eager to study the Young Sarpa.|
22562|You have to complete the quest "Lv.50 Magic Detecting" before you can enter Deep's Cavern.|
22563|Navea Stall Area|
22564|You led the Silverflash Ambassador back to Nudak Fortress.|
22565|Thank you for bringing me the Lighting Device. At least someone is willing to listen to me...|
22566|Come on. Let's go into the Ghostweep Cave and find that energy source!|
22567|You told the Village Chief that you were here to try and persuade him to come back with you.|
22568|What!? How could you side with those cowards?|
22569|The angry Village Chief attacks you!|
22570|Sidney: Mom kept talking about some kinda fortress... You think maybe she went there?|
22571|The compass was supposed to point me to this Star Stone and then to the treasure...  But since I only have the Stone, I'm stuck!|
22572|Research one (Substitute)|

22578|No problem! Just give me one moment.|
22579|Taylor spoke to the doorman in a hushed voice for a while. When they were done speaking, you were allowed to enter.|
22580|There is a seemingly endless staircase behind the door. After what felt like an eternity, you reached a secret basement at the bottom.|
22581|Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to "Fight Club!"|
22582|Today, we have a special guest...|
22583|This hero single-handedly took back the Demarech Mines and defeated Argus with god-like efficiency!|
22584|Tonight, and tonight only, we have an Envoy of Gaia in the battle!|
22585|Everyone, join me in welcoming the Envoy to the ring!|
22586|Alright! Now let's meet our challengers...|
22587|Give it up for Assault Union from the Demarech Mines!|
22588|Make some noise for the Thunderlions, straight outta Ventos Prairie!|
22589|Put your hands together for the Dwarf Princesses of Cactakara Forest!|
22590|Because we have such a prestigious warrior in the ring, the rules are a little different. The Envoy must defeat every single opponent in order to win!|
22591|The Assault Union versus the Envoy! Both sides are ready, so let's get on with it!|
22592|The Thunderlions versus the Envoy! Both sides are ready, so let's get on with it!|
22593|The Dwarf Princesses versus the Envoy! Both sides are ready, so let's get on with it!|
22594|The Assault Union's captain, Shaggy Harden, enters the ring!|
22595|The Thunderlions' captain, Lion-Leo, enters the ring!|
22596|The Dwarf Princess' captain, Granby, enters the ring!|
22597|Once the leader of a ruthless band of pirates, he dropped his life of plundering booty to take a job as a foreman in the mines!|
22598|It is said that his mystical sword gives him "Vision Beyond Vision," whatever that means. He's also rumored to have his own theme song!|
22599|You try growing up as a Dwarven Princess! It isn't exactly a life of privilege and favor, or so she insisted before the match. Now lets see how all that teenage angst translates into a fight!|
22600|That's it! The match is over! The winner is...|
22601|The hero of the people, the hope of the future...  Envoy of Gaia!|
22602|Everybody give the Envoy a big hand! What a battle!|
22603|You joyfully celebrate your victory with the others. As the party began to wind down, you made your way out of the club.|
22604|Quick! Get in the ring and respond to the audience's cheers!|
22605|Everyone is in their places and ready. Let the battle begin!|
22606|What a loser! Let me show you how it's done.|
22607|Get outta my way. I'll show you how a professional does it.|
22608|Oh man, I didn't expect to go down so quickly...|
22609|The boss will avenge my failure!|
22610|My prince, you've underestimated your enemy. Allow me, Osbert, to finish the job!|
22611|Let me try, I'll definitely win!|
22612|Fenrir has a target lock on you! Don't let him hit you, otherwise he'll recover HP!|
22613|Joshua's Reservation|
22614|Ada led you to the base of a cliff.|
22615|You and Ada quickly ran and hid behind a nearby rock.|
22616|No way! How come this "Mysterious Cactus" tastes the same as any other one?|
22617|Oh, I guess it could just be me. Perhaps my palate just isn't refined enough to appreciate it.|
22618|Then it's decided! I need to train my tastebuds by sampling the finest food Azuria has to offer!|
22619|Marvin bids you good day and struts off in search of gourmet cuisine.|
22620|Take the Moonlight Rabbit back to Immanuel|
22621|Bring the Moonlight Rabbit back to Immanuel as soon as possible.|
22622|You hear very faint cries from somewhere close by. It must be the missing Moonlight Rabbit.|
22623|As you approach the treasure chest, you hear disdainful laughter.|
22624|Tsubaki: "Ha ha ha!"|
22625|In a flash, Tsubaki appeared before you.|
22626|Tsubaki: "You won't claim this treasure so easily."|
22627|Tsubaki: "You will have to get past me first!"|
22628|The fierce battle tore open the boundaries between worlds, allowing <Iron Titan> Gigas to step through.|
22629|The fierce battle tore open the boundaries between worlds, allowing <Knight of the Sun> Aelius to step through.|

22639|The fierce battle tore open the boundaries between worlds, allowing <Feline Emperor> Tigerius Caesar to step through.|
22640|The Dimensional Fissure closed, and the Eidolons returned to their own world.|
22641|<Iron Titan> Gigas is somewhere in the forest. Find it!|
22642|<Knight of the Sun> Aelius is somewhere in the forest. Find him!|
22643|<Duke of Darkness> Eligos is somewhere in the forest. Find him!|
22644|<Champion of the Slain> Sigrun is somewhere in the forest. Find her!|
22645|<Empress of Torment> Bel-Chandra is somewhere in the forest. Find her!|
22646|<Heavenly Defender> Uzuriel is somewhere in the forest. Find her!|
22647|<Stormbringer> Vayu is somewhere in the forest. Find him!|

22652|<Feline Emperor> Tigerius Caesar is somewhere in the forest. Find him!|
22653|The hall is empty except for several Mirror Orbs floating about.|
22654|The Mirror Orbs seemed to understand that there were people in the hall, and they began to pulsate with light.|
22655|The Mirror Orbs began to project images that had been recorded eons ago.|
22656|After the images died down, noises began to echo around the hall.|
22657|Someone with an authoritative voice began to address the crowd.|
22658|Thank you all for joining me here.|
22659|The Woodbeasts can no longer be allowed to go about murdering our friends and family and destroying our homes!|
22660|I have gathered you all here at the base of the mountain to eradicate these beasts!|
22661|We must burn the entire forest down! Let not a single Woodbeast escape our flames!|
22662|The militia cheered loudly after hearing the speech.|
22663|Ganlin, my friend... I am counting on your magic and trickery, even though I do not trust it.|
22664|Cyril... How often must I remind you that a tool is only as evil as the one who wields it?|
22665|So you have told me. Fine, let's not argue. Come on, men, time to prepare for battle!|
22666|Ganlin and his wizards began pouring their magical energy into the stove, raising it to a searing temperature.|
22667|There was a rumbling like an earthquake, and from the forest came a great commotion.|
22668|Men! To arms! Do not cower, for this battle shall be forever remembered!|
22669|Fend off the Woodbeasts that are emerging from the forest. The wizards need time to heat up the stove.|
22670|Cyril! How many men can you spare? I need someone to collect Forest Essences in order to keep this fire burning!|
22671|Several Forest Essences are nearby. Send some men to collect them and keep feeding the stove!|
22672|There are too many of them! We need to get the fires started or we won't live through the day!|
22673|Burning down all five Vibrant Trees will stop the Woodbeast's attack, I'm sure of it!|
22674|Another tremor rumbled through the battlefield as a gigantic Woodbeast approached.|
22675|Stand together, men! We must stop it!|
22676|In the vision, you can see that Head Researcher Sainz has been trapped in front of the instrument.|
22677|Oh no, another one! Lead him away from here!|
22678|Regroup! Stay in formation!|
22679|Cyril! Send someone to collect the Shaped Flame Spirit and use it to burn down a Vibrant Tree!|
22680|Some researchers have collapsed nearby. What happened to them?|
22681|The first Vibrant Tree has been burned down! We are one step closer to victory!|
22682|As the last Vibrant Tree was reduced to ash, the Woodbeasts began to retreat back into the forest.|
22683|We've done it! We've won!|
22684|So you think you've won, ignorant humans?|
22685|Who is that?|
22686|It's a monster! I'll destroy it!|
22687|Cough, cough... What strange power is this?|
22688|I am Fink, Guardian of the Eastern Forest. Your pitiful resistance is no match for me.|
22689|I'll show you who is a match for whom! Take this! Wha- what?|
22690|Ha! Do you think I've shown you even a fraction of my true strength? How naive.|
22691|Come! I will be waiting at the summit of the mountain, if you feel brave or foolish.|
22692|The Mirror Orbs cease their activity, and the images before you disappear.|
22693|It seems like that is all you will see on this level. Head up and find out whats on the next level!|
22694|Theodore: "Power supply... Check. Weaponry... Check."|
22695|Theodore: "Threat detected. Solution: execute."|
22696|The Orbs dimmed and the vision vanished. The real Theodore appeared in the hall.|
22697|Visions filled the hall once more, resuming the story where it had left off.|
22698|You have completed the challenges on this floor, and the way to higher levels has opened.|
22699|Don't try straying from the four magic barriers for long, or my arcane power will make short work of you!|
22700|You must suppress the four powers at the same time, otherwise the one that was not suppressed will explode, dealing constant damage to all characters.|
22701|You douse the burning soldier with water and the fire goes out.|
22702|The soldier looks at you gratefully, then throws up into the container.|
22703|The soldier looks around in confusion, as if unsure about what has hurt him.|
22704|The events recorded by the Orb have been shown, and the visions slowly disappear.|
22705|It seems that these Orbs contain a visual record of events that took place long in the past.|
22706|When someone enters the Tower, the visions held in the Mirror Orbs begin to play out.|
22707|Those visions can be just as real as any monster, and serve as the protectors of the Sky Tower's secrets.|
22708|Black Marsh: "Humans, we live here, and coexist with nature."|
22709|Black Marsh: "We have never acted aggressively towards you, yet you attack our people indiscriminately."|
22710|Black Marsh: "And now you have invaded our territory in an attempt to wipe us out entirely!"|
22711|Black Marsh: "Humans! We will no longer tolerate these abuses!"|
22712|The Mechanical Core has reappeared on this level. There are several researchers around it.|
22713|Mechanical Core: "System diagnostics. Reboot. Checking power supply... Overloaded."|
22714|Mechanical Core: "Discharge excess power. Tampering evident. Switching to Defense Mode."|
22715|The Orbs dimmed as the visions vanished. The real concrete Core appeared once more inside the hall.|
22716|Mechanical Core: "Power discharge complete. Defense Mode terminated."|
22717|D-d-did you hear that? It sounds like v-v-voices!|
22718|You can hear that too? I thought I might have been imagining things.|
22719|C-c-could it be that those d-d-dead Slimelings are coming b-b-back to haunt us?|
22720|That's just silly. There's no such thing as ghosts.|
22721|And besides... Why would the ghost of a Slimeling bother you? You were never afraid of the living ones.|
22722|Y-y-you don't u-understand!|
22723|Who's out there? Hey, you, come out and show yourself!|
22724|L-l-l-look at the s-s-size of that Slimeling! How c-c-can we fight it?|
22725|Stay and get killed if you want. I'm out of here!|
22726|W-w-wait for me!|
22727|You've collected some Forest Essence. Quick, drop it into the Arcane Brazier!|
22728|The Arcane Brazier is burning a bit hotter now. Keep feeding more Forest Essences into the fire!|
22729|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 20% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22730|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 40% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22731|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 60% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22732|The flame in the Arcane Brazier is 80% as hot as it needs to get. Keep adding Forest Essences!|
22733|The flame in the Arcane Brazier has become so hot that a Shaped Flame Spirit was created.|
22734|The Shaped Flame Spirit is looking for a Vibrant Tree to burn down.|
22735|After producing a Shaped Flame Spirit, the Arcane Brazier has cooled down. It needs more Forest Essences before it can produce another spirit.|
22736|The Shaped Flame Spirit has burned down a Vibrant Tree! Keep collecting Forest Essences so you can burn down the rest!|
22737|Without warning, a huge figure emerged from the forest.|
22738|The Horror Quagmire has appeared!|
22739|Don't allow Horror Quagmire to to fuse with Black Marsh! This will heal Black Marsh.|
22740|Wait! Hey, where are you going? I said wait!|
22741|Destroy these creatures, brothers! Don't let them run! Chase them all the way to the summit!|
22742|There is a large gathering of Trolls, at at the center of which is a Parallax Troll.|
22743|There is a great clamor of angry voices; it seems this Parallax Troll is not particularly welcome.|
22744|The Mirror Orb begins to resonate with magical energy, and once again visions again fill the hall.|
22745|What appears before you is the image of a group of humans surrounding the Black Marsh as its life ebbs away.|
22746|The scholar Gammon has been mortally wounded. He collapses to the ground and breathes his last.|
22747|Black Marsh lumbered over to Gammon's side to see if the man was still breathing.|
22748|Black Marsh laid down beside Gammon and quietly passed away.|
22749|The argument is heating up. At any moment, it could turn into a brawl.|
22750|The vision of <Desert Stalwart> Zangis is no longer just a vision! It has taken form and entered into battle.|
22751|The vision of <The Butcher> Ashworth is no longer just a vision! It has taken form and entered into battle.|
22752|The vision of <Seriously Insane> Zolg is no longer just a vision! It has taken form and entered into battle.|
22753|A shimmering magical energy washed over the area, and the Secret Treasure Chest appeared.|
22754|Moon God: "Heh heh.. I found you."|
22755|As the light faded, Moon God appeared.|
22756|Moon God: "I'll never let you greedy people have the Secret Treasure Chest."|
22757|Moon God: "I will punish you, in the name of the moon!"|
22758|The buildings here seem familiar. You're certain you've seen them before.|
22759|You recall your dream about the Shadow Knight so long ago; this looks like that very place! However, there are some small differences...|
22760|A frozen seal rests in the center of the hall, calmly holding a great power at bay.|
22761|It seems to react to the presence of an Envoy of Gaia, however, as the seal begins to change.|
22762|Images begin to appear in the frozen surface.|
22763|I've had enough of you, weakling. I'm beginning to lose interest in toying with you.|
22764|Wha... What are you talking about? I haven't collapsed yet.|
22765|That can be fixed quite easily.|
22766|Wait! Wait one moment, I have an offer to make.|
22767|Make it quick, worm. I grow tired of this.|
22768|We shall battle to first blood, not to death. The first to draw blood on the other is the winner.|
22769|Why would I accept such terms? The sight of my own blood has never stayed my blade before now.|
22770|Wait, let me finish!|
22771|Then finish! Why do you speak so slowly?|
22772|One drop of blood in exchange for the lives of the people we represent. If you win, my people are yours to do with us as you please, and I will forever live with the shame of my failure. And you will do the same if I win.|
22773|You would barter the lives of your people for your own? Ha! Coward!|
22774|You only get this one chance to accept my offer, Fink. Decide now and let us finish this.|
22775|Very well, worm. In the name of my ancestors, I accept your terms.|
22776|Then I declare this contest to have begun. The first to draw blood shall be the winner.|
22777|Ha ha! Come at me, then! I am eager to be rid of your kind once and for all.|
22778|Wait, one more thing!|
22779|What in blazes is it now? Spit it out!|
22780|Why do you keep penguins in your forest?|
22781|Penguins? What is this nonsense about penguins?|
22782|Over there...|
22783|Ahh!|
22784|Fink, you gullible fool! Your blood has been spilled, and that means you've lost. Now you must hold to your word.|
22785|A blinding light suddenly erupts from the seal, knocking you backwards.|
22786|Low Voice: Deception and trickery! Is nothing below you foul humans?|
22787|Sky Tower Defense System: Alert! Containment field on fourth level prison has been disrupted. Fourth level is being locked down...|
22788|Low Voice: This may be a prison, worms, but it is still my prison. How dare you defile it!|
22789|Low Voice: Today you will face a grudge that is centuries old!|
22790|As Fink fell before you, the Tower began showing you images once again.|
22791|How dare you cheat like that! I will kill you!|
22792|You made a vow, Fink! In the name of your ancestors! Honor it!|
22793|Devilish trickery! You despicable, cruel, unfair creature!|
22794|One man's trickery is another's genius. Do you really think I could have bested you in a fair fight? Certainly not. So I bested you in a battle of wits instead!|
22795|...|
22796|Very well. Do what you will with me, just let my people leave this place in peace.|
22797|If you are trying to make me change the terms of our agreement, perhaps you should be a bit more humble.|
22798|Watch your tongue, human. You speak to a child of the gods themselves. I have conceded enough to you already.|
22799|Then you should mind your tone as well, 'child of the gods,' for you speak to the future king of these lands.|
22800|I will forgive you this time, Fink, and I will accept your request. Your people may live in the East City Forest, but they will live there under my rule.|
22801|You, on the other hand, will be sealed away. Imprisoned for all eternity in a place where no one might stumble across you.|
22802|It appears I have no choice. I will accept my punishment, but know that I will never forget this.|
22803|Ganlin, who had rendered himself invisible, suddenly reappeared.|
22804|Ah, Ganlin. I trust you witnessed all of this? I need you to seal Fink away inside of a Fragment.|
22805|Ganlin nodded to Cyril, and then began muttering an incantation over the Fragments in his hands.|
22806|I have held my promise, human, and so must you. If you go back on your word, I swear to you I will escape this prison and come for your head.|
22807|Fink shimmered and then vanished, his spirit absorbed into the Fragments in Ganlin's hands.|
22808|Fortunately, Fink is a proud ruler. If he hadn't kept his promise, we'd be in a lot of trouble.|
22809|Trouble? No, we'd most certainly be dead.|
22810|I do wonder how well that prison holds up, though. I'd hate to be the one to face him if he were to break out.|
22811|Best not to worry about it. Let's just take Fink's Soul and leave this place.|
22812|Several engineers were scurrying about, setting up Water Purifiers.|
22813|We'll go now, Master!|
22814|Abyssal Mud suddenly appeared began attacking the engineers!|
22815|Galia, you have such a big mouth!|
22816|I'm innocent!|
22817|Belenus better mean what he says. Otherwise his precious Navea will be no more.|
22818|Hmmmm. He will, he will...|
22819|The Orb flashes again, bringing to light more images from times past.|
22820|Everything will be fine, just fine. Just follow our script to the letter.|
22821|Sky Tower Defense System: Dangerous energy levels detected. Level is being locked down.|
22822|Waves of energy flooded through the area, making the air unbearably hot.|
22823|Up ahead the Infernal Disciple awaits a challenger.|
22824|You have passed the Infernal Disciple's trial. The path to the next level has opened.|
22825|You cannot advance to the next level unless you are in the "Infernal Trial" status.|
22826|Obtained "Infernal Trial" status.|
22827|You are qualified to challenge my incarnation!|
22828|Ha ha! It seems I made the right choice in allowing you to undergo this challenge! I will wait for you deeper within.|
22829|Ah, you are finally here! Now, show me your strength!|
22830|Bwa ha ha! You are worthy of the title of Envoy of Gaia after all! I will add my strength to yours!|
22831|You've delevered the summons. Go let Bernard know his people are on the way.|
22832|Leanne took several young boys and girls to a mysterious cave.|
22833|There are no traces of humans in sight, just veins of crystal and many Dragon Eggs.|
22834|Where did all of these eggs come from? There are no dragons in this region...|
22835|Leanne was shocked to find her bunny puppet there.|
22836|Watch out!|
22837|The Mirror Orb flickers and releases a burst of energy, momentarily distorting the image of Leanne.|
22838|The visions begin to overlap with reality as the energy field expanded.|
22839|As the energy continues to swell, the image of Leanne vanishes in a cloud of smoke. Once that smoke clears, you see...|
22840|A dragon has appeared! Not just a vision but a flesh-and-blood dragon!|
22841|The energy generated by the Orb dies off, and the visions begin to play once more.|
22842|As the children started to relax, two more dragons similar to Leanne appeared.|
22843|Oh no, more Giant Dragons!|
22844|A neverending swarm of Slimelings continued to try and destroy the Water Purifiers.|
22845|The Water Purifiers must be protected.|
22846|The visions on this level have ended, and a huge Treasure Chest has appeared in the center of the room.|
22847|Vhell has summoned a Primordial Flowertrap! Quick, bring it to the bonfire!|
22848|Karka has summoned a War Totem; drag it away, or else it will make him stronger!|
22849|Karka has summoned an Earth Totem; drag it away, or else it he won't take any damage!|
22850|Karka has summoned a Thunder Totem; stay out of the reach of it's attacks!|
22851|Karka has summoned a War Totem; drag it away, or else it will continuously heal him!|
22852|The Dragon's Servant is hatching eggs to restore Leanne's HP. Defeat them quickly!|
22853|You prepared to go on a dangerous trip with Hass to collect Dragon Bell Grass.|
22854|Your job is to keep Haas safe during the journey.|
22855|You need to be keeping Haas safe! Don't go running around recklessly.|
22856|Haas took a moment to rearrange the supplies in the cart, then carefully placed the Dragon Bell Grass inside.|
22857|After taking a moment to catch his breath, Haas wiped the sweat off his forehead and looked at you.|
22858|Leanne: "Sob sob..."|
22859|The Young Adventurer ran over to Leanne's side.|
22860|The Young Explorer told the Young Adventurer to look into the distance.|
22861|After hearing this question, Leanne felt ill at ease.|
22862|The Young Adventurer consoled Leanne, and she eventually calmed down.|
22863|The Rampaging Fire Sprite shrugs off most attacks. Only a Water Bomb can harm it.|
22864|Someone who takes a dip in the watery powers of the Pool can use the Water Bomb once.|
22865|There are three Treasure Chests ahead; open the one you think is best suited for you.|
22866|You can only open one of the three chests, so choose wisely.|
22867|Your intuition appears to be correct! There is some good stuff hidden here.|
22868|"Hmm... I don't think I can dig any more today..."|
22869|Nice job! You've found a bunch of buried relics!|
22870|This doesn't feel right. Try digging somewhere else.|
22871|Amanita and Voltaire walked out of the crowd and greeted Karka with a bow.|
22872|Amanita and Voltaire walked up to Karka and Gareth, and then began the prayer.|
22873|Once the last Rampaging Fire Sprite was put out, peace again returned to the area.|
22874|Visions swirled about once again, continuing to tell stories that hadn't been told for centuries.|
22875|You find a muddy chalice stuck in the muck.|
22876|A strange energy similar to that of the nearby Golden Pool makes you suspect that there is some relation...|
22877|Try throwing the glass into the pool, perhaps something interesting will happen.|
22878|After Amara spoke, a flash of lightning suddenly strikes you!|
22879|You were quite startled, but the lightning seems to have not harmed you.|
22880|You throw the chalice into the pool and watch as a golden water sprite slowly rises up.|
22881|You can hear voices coming from the hall ahead... Why not listen and try to find out what happened...|
22882|...There, that's the whole story. I hope you were listening closely, I won't repeat myself!|
22883|Our leader intends to join forces with the Shadow Knight - you all better be prepared!|
22884|The Shadow Knight?! What's going on... Could it be...|
22885|Uh, boss? Someone's eavesdropping on us!|
22886|Didn't I tell you to keep quiet and listen to - Wait, what did you say?! Who's out there! Show yourself!|
22887|Yikes, the guards! Looks like a temporary retreat is in order...|
22888|After the sounds of prayer fade, a wash of light falls across Karka and Gareth.|
22889|Once the light dissipates, Amanita and Voltaire bow to Karka again.|
22890|The world goes silent as Karka slowly materializes into the world, tangible at last.|
22891|Once more, visions begin to appear in front of the crowd. Gareth slowly retreats into the background.|
22892|Suddenly, Karka vomits up an incredible amount of thick, black blood and topples to the ground.|
22893|Amanita dashes out from the crowd to Karka's side, examining his injuries.|
22894|Joining forces, Zangis, Ashworth, and Zolg stop Gareth and disarm him.|
22895|Shocked, Gareth still manages to keep a cool head.|
22896|Gareth shifts his gaze to Amanita and sees a strange smile on his face.|
22897|Karka angrily shouts out Amanita's name before vomiting up more blood.|
22898|While pretending to tend to Karka's injuries, Amanita dripped some kind of strange liquid into his mouth.|
22899|Karka's body jerks a few times and he suddenly stops breathing.|
22900|Gareth smirks and stares at Amanita, mouthing a sentence...|
22901|The outlying mire having already been purified, the engineers proceed with preparations to tackle the enormous mire situation in the center.|
22902|Golly, what's that over there? Quick, someone come take a look!|
22903|Theodore has set up machine guns all around this area, please be careful out there!|
22904|Theodore has set up even more of his machine guns here - don't stop moving!|
22905|The Positive Electrodes are affecting you - please keep a safe distance from party members affected with Negative Electrodes!|
22906|The Negative Electrodes are affecting you - please keep a safe distance from party members affected with Positive Electrodes!|
22907|Keep your distance from others when you've been targeted by Volt Charge!|
22908|A Dragon's Servant has appeared in the northern hall! Quickly, you must defeat it!|
22909|A Dragon's Servant has appeared in the southern hall! Quickly, you must defeat it!|
22910|The second Vibrant Tree has been burnt down - victory is that much closer!|
22911|Zangis uses the "Shield Wall of Desert" to reduce the DMG received by surrounding party members.|
22912|You've been hit by Covalece! Quickly, get to the the vicinity of an Earth Totem!|
22913|Use a Bright Orange Pumpkin Bomb on players!|
22914|Use a Cool Green Pumpkin Bomb on monsters!|
22915|As the chest appears, a disdainful laugh echoes through the air.|
22916|Judging by that outfit, you'll need my fashion help too.|
22917|Weily emerges from the brilliant light!|
22918|Weily: "The Secret Treasure is mine! You shall not lay your hands upon it!"|
22919|Weily: "You shall taste the full strength of my might!"|
22920|Magical Thorns cover the road ahead - you can't pass for the moment.|
22921|The magic from the thorns is dissipating! Now's the time to clear them away and push forward!|
22922|That's the third Vibrant Tree - only two more to go to victory!|
22923|You've burned down four Vibrant Trees. Only one remains now!|
22924|The fifth tree.....The last Vibrant Tree is finally destroyed. All of you have performed admirably!|
22925|A great many footfalls can be heard ahead. It seems like the tower is a popular place!|
22926|Ah, you must be the Envoy of Gaia that my lord Shadow Knight mentioned, correct?|
22927|Heh, the breaking of the seal will soon be complete! You are too late, you cannot stop it. Perhaps you will be up to a little test? No? TOO BAD!|
22928|Come on! Let me see if you're as good as my lord claims!|
22929|Hmph, you really are quite...skilled. Perhaps we'll do this again sometime, for another...evaluation.|
22930|This sudden earthquake....What's going on?|
22931|Mwahaha! It's nearly done! No one can stop us now!|
22932|Time to deliver the news to my lord Shadow Knight. Mwahaha...|
22933|Enter the Crystal Portal as fast as you can! You must make it to the altar in time to protect the seal!|
22934|The Ocean Tyrant, Fish King of the Port of Skandia, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should do so quickly!|
22935|The Shadow of the Deep, Fish King of Helonia Coast, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22936|The Golden Blossom, Fish King of Crescent Hill, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22937|The Ancient Witness, Fish King of Cactakara Forest, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22938|The Dark Crystal, Fish King of the Demarech Mines, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22939|The Hot Tempered Overlord, Fish King of the Triatio Highlands, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22940|The Defender of the Marsh, Fish King of Candeo Marsh, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|

22942|The Deep Waterfall Ghost, Fish King of the Oblitus Wood , has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22943|The Sand-Spitting Hermit, Fish King of Star Sand Desert, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
22944|Head coordinates (285,643) in Crescent Hill's for a chance at catching the Lucky Petal Fish!|
22945|No! The Sealed Crystal has been destroyed!|
22946|Something strange appears in the center of the Magic Circle. What's going to happen next...|
22947|The Thunder Dragon has emerged from the seal! Quickly now, slay him!|
22948|Crisis averted!|
22949|This is the Lucky Petal Fish's habitat...|
22950|Vachnam shouts into the dark cavern: "Tavana! Come out and meet your death!"|
22951|A huge figure emerges slowly - it's Tavana, the Blood Spider Queen!|
22952|Vachnam suddenly leaps forward, attacking Tavana!|
22953|Effortlessly, Tavana fends off Vachnam's futile attack, striking him to the ground in one blow.|
22954|Tavana waves her hand and Vachnam's body turns to stone and shatters, scattering pieces all around.|
22955|Aveline suddenly appears and rushes towards Vachnam's corpse.|
22956|Aveline raises her staff high into the air, chanting in the ancient tongue of the dragons.|
22957|Tavana's true form manifests into the realm of Terra - she is now tangible!|
22958|Panting heavily, Aveline looks like that spell took a lot out of her...|
22959|Tavana raises her hand to strike Aveline with a fatal blow!|
22960|Suddenly, a figure appears in front of Aveline, shielding her from Tavana's devastating attack.|
22961|After a long look into Aveline's eyes, Vachnam suddenly rushes towards Tavana.|
22962|He dashes fast as lightning, striking Tavana with a powerful blow!|
22963|Unable to react in time, Tavana takes the full force of Vachnam's onslaught.|
22964|Aveline, expressionless, walks to the severely injured Tavana.|
22965|Although her face looks expressionless, Aveline's voice is trembling with fear.|
22966|The time for words finished, Aveline ended Tavana's life of monstrosities.|
22967|As she takes in the sight of Tavana's corpse and the scattered stones, a strange smile appears on Aveline's face...|
22968|She raises her hand, preparing to finally end her own life.|
22969|Smack! Suddenly, a small stone came flying out of nowhere, putting a stop to her actions.|
22970|Looking hopeful, Aveline looks around eagerly...|
22971|Seeing nothing, the hopeful light in her eyes slowly dimmed.|
22972|Picking up the small stone, Aveline sheds a few silent tears.|
22973|Tavana, intending to gorge herself upon the Dragonborn blood of the Gogen family, entered the family manor one night to take their lives...|
22974|After drinking their blood and absorbing their power, Tavana left - stronger than ever.|
22975|Margaret Gogen, the lone survivor, saw everything in the dark. With a trembling fist, she smashed her fist against the barrier.|
22976|The gem embedded within the barrier split in two, crashing to the floor.|
22977|Almost losing her mind, the shriveled bodies of her family seemed to be laughing at Margaret. At her failure to protect them...|
22978|Somewhere in the wind, a hollow voice seems to be whispering words of revenge...|
22979|Suddenly, the Gogen Family Manor grew dark, an essence of evil spreading across the land...|
22980|Strong hatred... how delicious... you want to revenge... you need more power...|
22981|Power... I can give you power... come here... come closer...|
22982|Come, come!... Pick me up... Pick me up! I can give you power... power...|
22983|The instant Margaret picks up the staff it exploded in a great ray of light, encircling Margaret within its power.|
22984|A circle of both frost and flame spin faster and faster around her...|
22985|After the effects fade, Margaret's appearance is completely changed!|
22986|Margaret's heart has now become the heart of this strange staff. The place where her heart once was is naught but an empty hole...|
22987|At that very moment, a horde of Slimelings suddenly appear and surround Margaret.|
22988|Margaret lets out a gasp as she catches a glimpse of her own reflection upon the icy surface...|
22989|Touching her face at first, she then trails her hand down to the hole in her chest and pauses.|
22990|Suddenly, a strange, transparent object falls before Margaret's face.|
22991|The floating Mirror Orb begins to vibrate, triggering a warning when the adventurer approaches.|
22992|Finally approaching the ancient ruins, he offers up a prayer for strength.|
22993|As Heath wanders the area calling for Margaret, a blurred silhouette appeared before him.|
22994|Heath stares at Aveline cautiously, observing every strange detail.|
22995|Determined to become stronger, Heath leaves in search of a source of power.|
22996|By the by, don't tarry long outside the four magic barriers, or my arcane power will make short work of you!|
22997|My power over the Great Land is also a power of Balance. I can control the elements of fire, ice, wind, and thunder.|
22998|There can only be one worthy of inheriting my great power. This person must be able to both comprehend and control the powers of all elements simultaneously!|
22999|You must maintain control over the four elements at the same time. If you fail, that which is not under your control will explode, and the results will be devastating.|
23000|The Power of Flame in the northeast is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23001|The Power of Ice in the northwest is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23002|The Power of Storms in the southeast is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23003|The Power of Lightning in the southwest is dissipating. If you don't defeat the other three elements at the same time, they will be revived by the Power of Balance.|
23004|The Flame Stone Guard in the northeast has been revived.|
23005|The Ice Stone Guard in the northwest has been revived.|
23006|The Storm Stone Guard in the southeast has been revived.|
23007|The Lightning Stone Guard in the southwest has been revived.|
23008|The unfinished memory begins to play once more.|
23009|Heath passed the test and has been granted the power, however...|
23010|As he observes the changing of his hands before his eyes, Heath speaks with a trembling voice.|
23011|Heath confirms that what he has seen of his new appearance is true.|
23012|Roaring with fury, Heath immediately heads back in search of Margaret.|
23013|Might I can grant you, but nothing comes for free. What price are you willing to pay, mortal?|
23014|Good... And yet, words alone carry too light a weight. See if you can pass my Trial of Stones.|
23015|If you pass the trial, I will grant my power to you.|
23016|You hear a muffled sound from the stinky flower bud nearby. Be on your guard!|
23017|The Crusader Captain raises his fingers to his mouth and whistles loudly.|
23018|You've been afflicted by the "Burnt" status! Move near to those with "Frostbite" to remove it.|
23019|You've been afflicted by the "Frostbite" status! Move near to those with "Burnt" to remove it.|
23020|Many Crusaders spring forth from the bushes, surrounding Aveline.|
23021|With a single swipe, Aveline knocks the wind out of her would-be attackers.|
23022|Aveline has summoned an invisible Guardian. Search where the arrows lead and try to root out the Guardian!|
23023|Aveline phases into Terra and begins to attack!|
23024|All the phantoms, Aveline, and the crusaders vanished from the battlefield...|
23025|Blindsided by the assault, Aveline starts casting random spells out of desperation.|
23026|After promising herself that she would never kill a human, the dead bodies all around seem to be mocking Aveline...|
23027|The Arachnid Dementors will continue to grow if left alive, and mature Arachnid Dementors will strengthen Tavana's powers.|
23028|Tavana has devoured the Arachnid Dementors, recovering health.|
23029|Tavana is preparing to cast her Toxic Net! Get to a safe location quickly!|
23030|Hunt down the Guardians to dispel Aveline's damage resistance.|
23031|When all the Guardians have been found, Aveline will lose her damage resistance.|
23032|All of a sudden, the Slimelings phase into reality and begin to approach as a group.|
23033|Weakened, Aveline phases out of the mortal realm. She must recover her strength, lest the Slimelings defeat her.|
23034|Defeat the Crossbreed Bats and retrieve their blood in order to help Aveline recover.|
23035|This floor is at peace, for now, and the phantom re-enters the realm, ready to continue!|
23036|Aveline absorbs the blood of the Crossbreed Bats, recovering slightly.|
23037|Aveline has recovered 20% of her strength - she needs more bat blood!|
23038|Aveline has recovered 40% of her strength - she's looking a bit better!|
23039|Aveline has recovered 60% of her strength - her power is growing even stronger!|
23040|Aveline has recovered 80% of her strength - almost there!|
23041|Aveline is completely recovered! She begins to cast a powerful spell!|
23042|As the events draw to a close, the vision cast by the orb slowly vanishes.|
23043|You have an iron will, mortal. It is something I can greatly appreciate.|
23044|You who have withstood the tumult; to you I shall grant my power.|
23045|The reliving of past memories has ended...for now.|
23046|The temperature is too high. Use the Water Bucket to douse the flames.|
23047|I am the Disciple charged with protecting the Whirlpool Abyss.|
23048|I've broken the Magic Barrier to Deep's Cavern.|
23049|Affected by the power of Gaia, the swirling blue crystals formed a huge whirlpool.|
23050|Swirl Disciples appear and try to stop the awakening of Nazrudin.|
23051|The Great Leviathan, Nazrudin, appears from the Swirling Gate!|
23052|The Great Leviathan, Nazrudin, has awakened from his nightmare!|
23053|Nazrudin: Envoy of Gaia! Dare you take on the might of the ocean?|
23054|Nazrudin: Noble Envoys of Gaia, I thank you for awakening me! You are worthy of my blessing!|
23055|The Swirling Gate can only remain open for 15 minutes.|
23056|The time remaining is 10 minutes. The Swirling Gate begins to grow unstable.|
23057|The time remaining is 5 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate begins to wane.|
23058|The time remaining is 3 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate is growing weaker and weaker.|
23059|The time remaining is 2 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate is growing weaker and weaker.|
23060|The time remaining is 1 minutes. The power of the Swirling Gate is growing weaker and weaker.|
23061|The whirlpool dissipated before you were able to awaken the Great Leviathan, Nazrudin.|
23062|You've been teleported to the Phasic Flame Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23063|You've been teleported to the Phasic Ice Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23064|You've been teleported to the Phasic Storm Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23065|After being silent for a while, Aveline speaks once again.|
23066|Aveline waves her staff angrily. A spell of ice and fire gradually encircles Vachnam.|
23067|Aveline turns around to avoid looking into Vachnam's eyes...|
23068|Frowning in annoyance, Aveline sighs at Vachnam's stubbornness.|
23069|Vachnam softens his tone after seeing how Aveline frowns.|
23070|Aveline closes her eyes for a moment and then looks sternly at Vachnam.|
23071|Vachnam seems very anxious, as though afraid of something.|
23072|After listening to Vachnam's request, Aveline seems only slightly surprised.|
23073|After becoming a monster, surely nobody would care about her now... Aveline sulks.|
23074|Aveline's dark and sullen mood begins to attract negative energy that slowly begins to envelope her.|
23075|The Negative Energy Aggregate deal damage to Aveline. Defeat them as quickly as you can!|
23076|The Negative Condensation in the southeast has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23077|The Negative Condensation in the northwest has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23078|The Negative Condensation in the northeast has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23079|The Negative Condensation in the southwest has been fully formed and is now heading towards Aveline.|
23080|A freezing wind blows across the battlefield, swiftly smiting all the Slimelings in a single spell from Aveline's staff.|
23081|Red Phosphorus Mines, south of Candetonn.|
23082|Vachnam starts to gather the power of the Standing Stone Field - quickly, everyone must step into it!|
23083|Vachnam summons Split Vachnam and begins to heal himself! Quickly, defeat them and stop the healing!|
23084|Quickly find Moe and report back.|
23085|Zukitung: Haha! I'm back! Soon, all the treasure here will be in the claws of the Varan Bandits!|
23086|You have over 10 stacks of Torturing Flame! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23087|You have over 10 stacks of Frost Crack! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23088|You have over 10 stacks of Storm Breath! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23089|You have over 10 stacks of Ride the Lightning! If you don't switch your target to a different stone guard, you will take extremely high damage.|
23090|It sounds like there are gears turning inside. Perhaps they're connected to some device!|
23091|You must destroy all the defense turrets so that the gate can be opened.|
23092|Aveline quickly corrected herself.|
23093|After a moment of doubt, Heak begins to speak.|
23094|Aveline seemed shocked to hear it.|
23095|Elder Yeshe uses his magic to teleport you back, saving you from the flames.|
23096|Moe and the rest of the group discussed what they saw happening...|
23097|Talk to Moe and find out what the group discussed.|
23098|Who dares to disturb my slumber...|
23099|Zukitung: Humph! Don't get too excited, you stubborn archaeologists! Like a bad penny, I'll turn up again!|
23100|The Thruster is now equipped. Fly to the end of the corridor and turn off the Flame Trap!|
23101|Help the Sacred Tree to grow|
23102|Charm Queen: Oh-hohohohoho~|
23103|You've been teleported to the Phasic Lightning Golem. Destroy it to remove the protection it grants to Vachnam.|
23104|All the guardians must be found and destroyed to remove the protection they grant Aveline.|
23105|The Crossbreed Bat was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23106|The Savage Stone Turtle was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23107|The Spiny Crocodile was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23108|The Primeval Sprout was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23109|The Pastel Butterfly Fairy was whipped into a frenzy by the battle and has gone ballistic! Kill it now before it becomes even stronger!|
23110|Divine Branding stacks over 3 times! If you don't enter a Magic Circle, you'll keep taking high damage.|
23111|As the Secret Chest appeared, you heard a charming voice.|
23112|Vermilion: "Well well, look at this chest!"|
23113|An exotic figure emerged from the magic circle.|
23114|Vermilion: "You wanna brawl over this? Sounds like we could have some fun!"|
23115|Lang: The King's Precious Possession we found is in danger! We need backup from anyone who can help!|
23116|Natalie: Dangit! The King's Precious Possession is gonna get swiped if we don't do something! C'mon guys, give us a hand!|
23117|Lang: The Guardian Sprite we found is in danger! We need backup from anyone who can help!|

23120|Natalie: Dangit! The Miracle Sword is gonna get swiped if we don't do something! C'mon guys, give us a hand!|
23121|Lang: The Winged Steed we found is in danger! We need backup from anyone who can help!|
23122|Natalie: Dangit! The Winged Steed is gonna get swiped if we don't do something! C'mon guys, give us a hand!|
23123|Lang: The Spring Maiden Statue we found is in danger! We need backup from anyone who can help!|
23124|Natalie: Dangit! The Spring Maiden Statue is gonna get swiped if we don't do something! C'mon guys, give us a hand!|
23125|After Thunder Dragon Taloc fell, the tremendous energy in his body diffused into the hall.|
23126|The temple absorbed a tremendous amount of electrical energy - only a small amount remains on the ground.|
23127|A mysterious figure quietly floats into view...|
23128|I'm Serena, and I'm here to claim the Dragon King's treasure! Go on and get it, bunnies!|
23129|Hey! Why haven't you stopped? The secret treasure is all mine now, you guys can go home or whatever!|
23130|I'm Vermilion, the Phoenix Enchantress! None shall defile what I have decided I want!|
23131|Whoa there! If you guys don't put down the Treasure Chest right now, the next dart will be much more accurate than the first...|
23132|Torian put down the food, and went to the creek not far away to wash his hands.|
23133|A tiny figure approached quietly, picked up the food with its mouth, and left as quickly as it had come.|
23134|Torian found several footprints in the nearby area and he studied them for quite some time.|
23135|Following these footprints, Torian walked towards the forest.|
23136|The Tiny Hornwolf seemed to have understood what Torian said, and dropped its guard.|
23137|The Tiny Hornwolf approached happily, and took the food from Torian with its mouth.|
23138|The two little ones are sharing the food. It seems they're getting along pretty well.|
23139|Torian burps and turns around to check out the Tiny Hornwolf, who's still eating.|
23140|After the Tiny Hornwolf finished eating, it rubbed Torian gently.|
23141|The Tiny Hornwolf licked Torian's face affectionately, seeming to have agreed.|
23142|Fenrir seemed to notice something and took off in that direction.|
23143|Torian chased after Fenrir, shouting angrily.|
23144|By the time Torian caught up, Fenrir's jaws were wide open and ready for business.|
23145|Torian struck Fenrir hard enough to make him see stars.|
23146|With a repentant whimper, he gave Torian a careful nuzzle in return.|
23147|Torian picked up the Intoxicating Grass, which is exudes a rich aroma.|
23148|Both Torian and Fenrir then fell into a deep slumber under the effects of the fragrance.|
23149|Suddenly, a piercing wail roused Fenrir from his dream!|
23150|The Intoxicating Grass seemed to have been spooked - it stood as though in shock for a moment before fleeing.|
23151|He sprang at the Intoxicating Grass and knocked it unconscious with a claw.|
23152|He then returned to Torian and nudged him gently with one of his forepaws.|
23153|Torian was trapped in his nightmare - there seemed to be no sign of his waking.|
23154|After trying several times to no effect, the impatient Fenrir decided to take a good whack.|
23155|The tough love worked! Torian finally regained consciousness.|
23156|Torian walked to the Intoxicating Grass and packed it into the bag.|
23157|Torian took out the liquor jar, put in on the ground and then opened it.|
23158|Fenrir snuck his way to the liquor jar for a taste while Torian's attention was elsewhere.|
23159|Torian grabbed Fenrir's ear and dragged him into the nearby bushes.|
23160|On hearing this, Fenrir scratched at Torian's feet and howled, begging for mercy.|
23161|Torian lit a bonfire and roasted a Phantom Bunnyhop in no time.|
23162|After clearing the leftovers, Torian started to clean up after the fire.|
23163|While Torian was busy cleaning up, Fenrir ate all the leftover Phantom Bunnyhops.|
23164|Torian turned around to find tufts of Bunnyhop hair scattered about -- and Fenrir, his face a picture of innocence.|
23165|Seeing Torian freak out, Fenrir's ears drooped and he mentally prepared himself for a good whooping.|
23166|Before Torian finished his scolding, Fenrir bolted, leaving Torian standing dumbfounded.|
23167|Powerless, Fenrir lay on the side of the road, his stomach growling and gurgling.|
23168|Fenrir seemed to smell something, and ambled off in the direction the smell was coming from.|
23169|Following the delicious smell, Fenrir snuck into a restaurant's kitchen.|
23170|As he wolfed down the food and lapped up the wine, Fenrir felt like a million gold.|
23171|But poor Fenrir had a little TOO much wine, and ended up leaving the kitchen a disaster.|
23172|The frightened waiters rushed out into the street, and hearing their cries, the guards on patrol came running.|
23173|Fenrir wobbled out of the restaurant, not sure why all the guards were standing in the street.|
23174|Following Fenrir's tracks, Torian found his way to the restaurant.|
23175|He saw people scrambling around with ropes, trying to bind the unconscious Fenrir.|
23176|Frustrated, Torian sighed and went in the direction he thought Fenrir had gone.|
23177|After whipping out his knife and scaring the crowd away, Torian turned to check up on Fenrir.|
23178|Fenrir lay on the ground, reeking of booze. He was passed out cold, dreaming away.|
23179|An elegent woman in a plain dress walked toward them.|
23180|Leila raised her hand and stopped the Guard Captain before he finished speaking, then turned her head to get a good look at Torian.|
23181|Torian turned around and smacked Fenrir in the head.|
23182|Fenrir suddenly woke up with a start, leaping from the ground!|
23183|Torian smacked Fenrir again, then grabbed him by the ear and dragged him away.|
23184|Saint Nicolas: Excellent! I'll start repairing the sled straightaway! Just wait a bit while I go to work.|
23185|As Saint Nicolas was repairing the sleigh, the sky grew darker. The residents of the Small Winter Village went back home from the event too.|
23186|Saint Nicolas: The sleigh has been repaired, my young friend. Let's get this show on the road!|
23187|Jump onto the sleigh and then talk to Saint Nicolas to trigger the event.|
23188|The sleigh lurches forward with an unexpected heave! Aim carefully at the target and use the "Deliver Gift" skill to complete the mission.|
23189|The gift accidentally fell out of the sleigh. Please go back to the entrance and find Saint Nicolas to start over again.|
23190|From the front came a muffled roar, mingled with the gurgling cries of the dying.|
23191|The Bloody Mudpile is absorbing the flesh and blood of the nearby corpses.|
23192|The Bloody Mudpile is poking and prodding at the nearby corpses.|
23193|Not far away, several soldiers are confronting the Sarpa.|
23194|Misaena awkwardly rushes a teleportation spell, and as its incantation finishes, a Magic Barrier surrounds her.|
23195|With a flash of light, Misaena's form vanishes from the battlefield.|
23196|The next monster coming is ready to fight, so keep your guard up!|
23197|Be careful, there's another monster coming through the dimensional rift!!|

23208|A human figure suddenly appeared between Hel and the Thorny Flower Fairies.|
23209|Hel walked calmly past Bealdor, and vanquished the Thorny Flower Fairies with a simple spell.|
23210|Hel wished to continue exterminating the Thorny Flower Fairies, but Bealdor stopped her.|
23211|Bealdor looked back, only to find out all the Thorny Flower Fairies had disappeared.|
23212|A shadowy figure suddenly appeared before Hel and Bealdor.|
23213|After she finished speaking, Hel turned and left.|
23214|Gram followed Hel, and began to hear voices.|
23215|Gram: "Miss, you're heading in the wrong direction. You should have chosen the path on the left."|
23216|Hel: "Wrong again... how about you go first, Gram?"|
23217|Hel stopped suddenly when Gram appeared before her.|
23218|Gram's body grew to a tremendous size, blocking the exit.|
23219|Shortly after Bealdor left, Hel returned.|
23220|Hel went full circle and returned to where she started.|
23221|A tiny figure appeared nearby and slowly approached Hel.|
23222|Hel went to the exit, only to find it blocked by Gram.|
23223|Before Hel could strike him, Gram spoke.|
23224|Hel stopped suddenly, and looked around for the person Gram spoke of.|
23225|Somewhat shocked, Bealdor tried to pursue Hel, only to find she had already left.|
23226|Bealdor took out an exquisite chest and carefully placed the Light of Dawn inside.|
23227|Bealdor thought for a moment and waved his hands, casting a spell to make the chest vanish.|
23228|Bealdor took a piece of paper from his breast pocket. On it were strange drawings that even the gods couldn't decipher.|
23229|Bealdor threw the piece of paper on the ground in anger, but soon picked it up again.|
23230|Bealdor arrived at the Entrance to Pandemonium but was stopped by Gram, who had followed the Breath of Light.|
23231|With a wave of his hands, Bealdor's Exquisite Chest appeared before Gram.|
23232|Unable to dissuade Bealdor, Gram was forced to open the chest.|
23233|As the Light of Dawn shone upon him, Gram groaned. His body shuddered, transforming into a longsword and falling to the ground with a clatter.|
23234|Without giving him a chance to speak, Hel attacked Bealdor.|
23235|Jormungand waved his hand and sheathed Gram, who had transformed into a sword.|
23236|Saint Nicolas: Ah, are you an adventurer here to help me out? Come, come here!|
23237|Collect 5 Wooden Planks, 5 Ropes and 5 Inedible Red Fruits, then talk to Saint Nicolas to trigger the event.|
23238|Saint Nicolas: Hold on tight, we're heading back now!|
23239|Send Gift|

23245|When <Red> Thorny Flower Fairy starts growing armor, you can use the "Pandemonium Flame" to burn it.|
23246|Bealdor has manifested the darkness within him. The Pure Light Force now protects him from injury!|
23247|First, defeat the Dark Creatures emanating from Bealdor!|
23248|The Dark Creatures will turn into pure Dark Energy after they die, which can deal significant damage to surrounding enemies.|
23249|Dark Energy can pierce the Divine Light. The person targeted by the Dark Energy must lure it to Bealdor.|
23250|You've been targeted by the Dark Energy! Now lure it to Bealdor!|
23251|Bealdor's Divine Light has been breached, leaving him vulnerable to attack!|
23252|You're being damaged by the Light Force. Leave the Divine Light as quickly as possible.|
23253|Gram summons Phantom Crystals, and Gram's Phantom appears!|
23254|You can only defeat Gram's Phantom by destroying the Phantom Crystals!|

23260|The Blessing of Light can help you to break this evil force!|
23261|Suddenly, the Phantoms freeze and begin to disappear.|
23262|The Orb glows again, and the Phantoms reappear.|
23263|Bealdor appeared in front of Hel and confronted the Thorny Flower Fairies.|
23264|Suddenly, out of nowhere, Gram's Phantom appeared.|
23265|The Orb glowed again, and the phantoms of Hel and Bealdor appeared.|
23266|Once the words were uttered, Hel's Phantom appeared before you.|
23267|The Orb glowed again, and numerous phantoms appeared.|
23268|Hel and Gram appeared, locked in battle.|
23269|With Bealdor's departure, all the other phantoms began to dissapear.|
23270|In their place, glowing Glimmers appeared.|
23271|The Orb continued to glow, and Bealdor's Phantom reappeared.|
23272|After the conversation, Hel's Phantom disappeared and Bealdor's Phantom appeared.|
23273|The Orb kept glowing and spinning, telling the unfinished tale.|
23274|Hel and Bealdor stood and stared at each other, as Gram transformed into a sword between them.|

23284|From deep within the Umbras, a light shines in the darkness. This is the light Bealdor spoke of.|
23285|Someone must enter Glimmering Collection Circle and gain Glimmer Collector's Power, then use it to bring the Glimmers back.|
23286|With Glimmer Collector's Power, you can bring Glimmers back to Glimmering Collection Circle.|
23287|With Glimmer Collector's Power, you can protect Glimmer Collectors from their concentrated attacks.|
23288|Power of Dawn gives you the ability to destroy Umbras. When an Umbra is destroyed, you have a chance of capturing a Glimmer.|

23300|The Glimmer is highly unstable and could disappear at any time. Bring it to Glimmering Collection Circle as quickly as possible.|
23301|Hel used the Power of Storm to summon Storm Hel.|
23302|Hel used the Power of Flame to summon Flame Hel.|
23303|Hel used the Power of Ice to summon Ice Hel.|
23304|As the phantoms begin to disappear, Hel herself comes to battle!|
23305|Solder: I feel so much better, thank you!|
23306|Glimmers will perform energy attacks on their carriers. Acquire Glimmer Protector's Power to keep Glimmer Collectors safe.|
23307|Glimmers are hiding among the Umbras. Acquire Power of Dawn to dispel the Umbras.|

23313|Corrupted by Dark Energy, the power of Divine Light has been weakened.|
23314|Kali: First, I'll need some Bug Eggs.|
23315|Kali: First, I'll need some Mushrooms.|
23316|Kali: First, I'll need some Beer Powder.|
23317|Kali: First, I'll need an Orchid.|
23318|Kali: First, I'll need some Crocodile Organs.|
23319|Kali: Next, I'll need a Snake Egg.|
23320|Kali: Next, I'll need several Red Stamens.|
23321|Kali: Next, I'll need several Cabbage Leaves.|
23322|Kali: Next, I'll need a Skullcap.|
23323|Kali: Next, I'll need a bottle of Lizard Saliva.|
23324|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Sakura Coral.|
23325|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Forest Land Crab.|
23326|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Crystal Fragment.|
23327|Kali: Finally, I'll need a Seashell.|
23328|Kali: Finally, I'll need Werewolf Nails.|
23329|Kali: Great! You used the correct ingredients; now we can proceed...|
23330|Kali: Oh no! What have you done? You used the wrong ingredients!|
23331|Kali: This type of Bug Egg contains a substance that heals injuries.|
23332|Kali: Mushrooms are very nutritious, and very helpful for healing injuries.|
23333|Kali: Beer Powder... surprised? It helps with the absorption of the other ingredients.|
23334|Kali: Orchids are rich in iron, which helps blood circulation.|
23335|Kali: This type of Crocodile is very effective at healing itself, and its organs are the source of this power.|
23336|Kali: Snake Eggs secrete protein prior to hatching, which makes them excellent catalysts.|
23337|Kali: Sometimes, when two materials won't react, Red Stamens can make a reaction happen.|
23338|Kali: Cabbage Leaf... looks normal, right? Now you know its real value!|
23339|Kali: Skullcaps contain many useful substances. It's a bit of a waste to use them as activators, but it's very effective.|
23340|Kali: The enzymes in Lizard Saliva can bring out the hidden effects of certain ingredients... makes sense, right?|
23341|Kali: Sakura Coral keeps the potion from being absorbed too quickly during digestion.|
23342|Kali: Forest Land Crab has numerous medical properties. Nearly every part of it can be used in potions.|
23343|Kali: The molecular structure of this type of Crystal is very stable, and will help the potion interact with the body's immune system.|
23344|Kali: This type of Seashell evolved over millennia. Its genetic material is very unique.|
23345|Kali: This... it may seem disgusting, but it's a very effective ingredient.|
23346|Kali: Great! The potion is done!|
23347|Kali: Are you ready? Then let's start blending it.|
23348|You place the impaled Sea Monster Corpse in the middle of the battlefield. Immediately, the nearby Sarpa are shocked and terrified.|
23349|Kali: Ah! The ingredients for the third stage have been added correctly. Let's see what we have...|
23350|A strange sound emanates from within the Whirlpool Abyss.|
23351|A huge, shadowy figure begins to rise from the bottom of the Whirlpool Abyss.|
23352|A massive creature surfaces in the Whirlpool Abyss. This must be Nazrudin, the legendary Great Leviathan!|
23353|Summoning Nazrudin has made him furious. He leaves the Whirlpool Abyss and makes his way ashore!|
23354|Open the Sentry Commands and answer the Sentry Captain to obtain the Battlefield Report.|
23355|Go to the Myriad Tombs, look for the Nameless Tombstones, find the Runic Ghosts inside and eliminate them.|
23356|Use the Magic Circles to bounce over the Ice Boars and eliminate the Ghostspinners at (552, 285).|

23364|Camilla: There are some medical tools in the First-aid Kit. Use different tools for different occasions.|
23365|Still preparing...|
23366|Still preparing...|
23367|You added numerous layers of wood to the Broken Barricade to strengthen it.|
23368|When you finish nailing the wood to the Barricade, you survey the battlefield. You have the distinct feeling you might need to repair the Barricade again soon.|
23369|After attaching the wood, you examine the Barricade. It's not as strong as it once was, but it should work.|
23370|Looking at the wood in your hands, you wonder how much you'll have to carry by the battle's end.|
23371|Ouch! You hammered your finger!|
23372|After hearing Baird's report, you decide to go to Lion's Roar Stronghold to join the battle.|
23373|After hearing Kara's report, you decide to go to Joint Operation Camp to join the battle.|
23374|After hearing Chaim's report, you decide to go to the front lines with Anya to learn more about the situation.|
23375|After receiving updated information about the wounded from Camilla, you set out to help treat them.|
23376|These supplies must be immediately sent to Lion's Roar Stronghold, the volunteer encampment, and the assault force in Drowsy Glen.|
23377|There is a great deal of scrap metal on the battlefield. Stay sharp as you collect it!|
23378|Try to defeat the Black Tooth Army Base now that the Lion's Roar Stronghold has them surrounded. Support Shalen, who is stationed in Black Tooth Mountain.|
23379|Guard the Supply Wagon well - we're counting on it!|
23380|Eliminate all enemies, and plant the Alliance Flag in Black Tooth City!|
23381|The Lion's Roar Army's strategy was a success! Report back to Baird so he can deploy soldiers effectively.|
23382|Find wood nearby and use it to repair the Broken Barricade.|
23383|Tanner and Amon are attacking Toxic Fortress. Help them!|
23384|The Sarpa Warpriest has summoned a terrifying Deepsea Monstrosity. Kill it before it kills you!|
23385|The strategy was a success! Summon everyone back to the camp so the Alliance can bombard the enemy.|
23386|According to the battle plan, you must read the report from Anya and Hermione to receive your next order.|
23387|Note: airborne battle time is limited! Use Glide and follow the Flight Path to flank your enemies.|
23388|You must destroy the Dark Gate to keep the Dark Legion from passing through it.|
23389|Find and eliminate the Scourge Artillery in the Dark Legion Base.|
23390|Time to break through. Bomb the enemy's most important sites!|
23391|Although the Dark Gate was repaired, we gained some intel. Bring it back to Chaim.|
23392|To help the Alliance with their new Chipper, go to the Logging Camp in the Southeast.|
23393|Carrion Barrier|
23394|Black Tooth Mountain|
23395|Drowsy Glen|
23396|The Dark Legion|

23400|Joint Operation Camp|
23401|Alliance Logging Camp|
23402|You raise the Alliance Flag. As it flutters in the wind, your heart swells with pride.|
23403|All of a sudden, a deep voice shakes the earth...|
23404|Horsemen of War: Kill... Let the earth be stained with blood...|
23405|Three Fallen Angels descend from the sky, flapping their black wings.|
23406|Horsemen of War: Let him be released... None shall survive!|
23407|In the name of God, release the imprisoned Banoleth!|
23408|The three Fallen Angels begin to chant the dark words together.|
23409|Banoleth: After millions of years, I am free of my shackles! My enemies will drown in a lake of fire!|
23410|Anya: Look out! Banoleth has been released - get ready to fight!|
23411|After an intense battle, Banoleth lies in a pool of blood. The deep voice begins speaking again...|
23412|Horsemen of War: Keep fighting... Feast on the blood of your enemies...|
23413|Horsemen of War: I will walk among you as you battle...|
23414|Horsemen of War: Wait... for death...|
23415|Eternal Wisdom Elder, the Fish King of Vulture's Vale, has appeared. Challenge him if you dare!|
23416|Nazrudin has appeared in the vicinity of Whirlpool Abyss (420, 386). Go destroy him!|
23417|Warlord Claret and Periwinkle roar in anger. Get ready to fight!|
23418|Pick up the torch.|
23419|Abandoned Frost Crystal Mine entrance|
23420|Floating Magic Circle|
23421|Escape from Magic Circle|
23422|You're stuck in the ice coffin. Quick, use Desperate Punch to escape!|
23423|I wanted to try out my acting skills a bit more, but it seems nobody is interested... What do you say?|
23424|Alright, then... let's try out a scene...|
23425|This chapter is called "The Stupid Envoy of Gaia is Doomed." Isn't it great?|
23426|Let's get started!|
23427|Just when you thought Argus was defeated, his body began to flash rapidly.|
23428|The air around you grows cold. Suddenly, Argus reappears before you.|
23429|A single phantom made of dragon scale makes everyone so worried... wow...|
23430|I'd love to keep playing with you, but I have more important things to do.|
23431|Follow me and I'll show you what I can do!|
23432|Argus scoffed, and immediately disappeared behind the seal.|
23433|Argus is about to release the Aqua-Dragon Queen! Quick, stop him!|
23434|When you tried to come here, the mountain around me seemed to be crying.|
23435|Argus begins to speak Draconic, and the whole cave starts shaking violently.|
23436|As Argus speaks more rapidly, the air around the huge Stone Tablet begins to freeze.|
23437|Suddenly, waterspouts spring from the ground, and a dragon's roar echoes through the cave.|
23438|The huge Monument Seal is crushed by Argus's power.|
23439|A massive figure appears... the legendary Aqua-Dragon Queen, Lianne Riverwalker.|
23440|Argus smiled maliciously and spoke to the Aqua-Dragon Queen.|
23441|Uhh... the potion did taste a bit strange, but I don't feel anything yet...|
23442|Ahh! My body is burning!|
23443|Urgh... I'm gonna throw up...|
23444|Where am I? Who are you? Get away from me!|
23445|I feel so much better, thank you!|
23446|You guessed wrong! Now receive the curse of the Treasure Chest!|
23447|You've captured <Cruel Poacher>Beyeta! Pick up the egg and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23448|You've captured <Deadly Seed>Darlak! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23449|You've captured <Listener>Michelle! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23450|You've captured <Giant Horn>Dinglebert! Pick up the crate and deliver it to Guard Rocky!|
23451|You've captured <Scarlet Claw>Calona! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23452|You've captured <Axe Raider>Zagon! Pick up the crate and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23453|You've captured <Spiked Spine>Rumeon! Pick up the urn and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23454|You've captured <Flesh Ripper>Marco! Pick up the egg and deliver it to Guard Kess!|
23455|There appears to be a strange mound up ahead. We must remain vigilant...|
23456|The Aqua-Dragon Queen mutters and looks at you sadly.|
23457|You hear a gentle voice inside your head...|
23458|Lianne: I'm sorry... please forgive me... it wasn't my choice...|
23459|The massive body of Lianne Riverwalker crashes to the ground, and Von explodes in anger.|
23460|Suddenly, two floating lights appear next to you. Two figures emerge from the light.|
23461|As Taloc whispers, the Aqua-Dragon Queen changes into her human form.|
23462|Argus's arrogant laughter fades away.|
23463|The three of them disappear, leaving you with more questions than answers.|
23464|It seems this ancient grudge might not be resolved until next time.|
23465|You're surrounded! Fight them off and keep pressing forward!|
23466|You feel unwelcome in this place, and sense an unsettling air of hostility.|
23467|You found the thief!|
23468|Fenrir is hungry and starts to attack!|
23469|Fenrir ate the fresh food and grew stronger!|
23470|Fenrir ate the spoiled food and grew weaker!|
23471|Torian's food is scattered all over. Prevent Fenrir from eating it!|
23472|The food is rotten and stinks to high heaven. Keep your distance!|
23473|Predictably, he then fled the scene!|
23474|Some of the food seems to be going bad. You should eat it up before it's rotten.|
23475|Some of the food has been left out too long. One can hardly recognize...|
23476|The wine barrel breaks and dream wine spills forth, forming a puddle.|
23477|You have been targeted by the Helheim Wind Spirit! Stay away from him.|
23478|Reserved|
23479|Reserved|
23480|Reserved|
23481|The Lightning Magnet is fully charged. It's about to explode!|
23482|Fenrir is covered in electricity. Quick, find the Lightning Magnet!|
23483|You arrived just in time! Give the package to McKinley.|
23484|Quest failed - you took too long. (Abandon Quest and try again.)|
23485|The phantom slowly disappears, and the forest begins to show itself.|
23486|The Phantom Orb glows softly, revealing Torian and Fenrir gazing at each other.  |
23487|Scenes from the dream appear in the mist, visible to all.|
23488|The Phantom Orb glows softly, and Torian and Fenrir appear to be asleep again.|
23489|The jar of liquor has been opened, releasing an intoxicating cloud.|
23490|The Orb starts to shine again. You can see many drunk Bunnyhops lying around the jar.|
23491|After these words are spoken, Fenrir's phantom materializes.|
23492|Fenrir's drunken apparition appears on the scene again, surrounded by a large number of guards.|
23493|After these words are spoken, Torian's phantom materializes.|
23494|The Phantom Orb glows softly, and Torian's phantom reappears. |
23495|A cute Bunnyhop pokes its head out of the grass. You wave at the Bunnyhop, and it bounces over to you.|
23496|Sunny is not here - try looking for him somewhere else.|
23497|It's the Purple Meadow Carol was talking about.|
23498|Fenrir stands open-mouthed, looking innocently at Torian.|
23499|Torian puts away the Great Axe, and switches to Dual Blades.|
23500|Torian attaches the Dual Blades to his waist, and switches back to the Great Axe.|
23501|Torian has summoned Wild Oxen to his aid. Quick, get out of their way!|
23502|Torian has locked onto you. Carefully lead him away from the others.|
23503|The pots in each corner start boiling - each will have a different fortifying effect for Torian.|
23504|A Crescent Sprite appears in the grass. She doesn't seem very happy about being disturbed.|
23505|McKinley: I slept like a log - now it's time to get something to eat...|
23506|Happy to have finally found the right person, you ask him to accompany you back to meet Autumn.|
23507|Suddenly, a ghostly-looking Old Mage approaches you.|
23508|Villager: That must be another one of the demon's minions. Execute him!|
23509|You unseal the Magic Book with an Unsealing Incantation.|
23510|A fiercely hot barrier of magical flames surrounds the Magic Book.|
23511|Once the magical flames are out, you go to put Dirk's book in your Backpack.|
23512|Before unsealing the grimoire, your curiosity gets the best of you, and you glance at it quickly.|
23513|It appears to be Dirk's sketchbook, filled with fantastical, heroic images.|
23514|The Soul Gem glows faintly. The person you seek should be close.|
23515|The Soul Gem glows warmly. The person you seek should be close.|
23516|The Soul Gem glows powerfully. The person you seek should be close.|
23517|The Soul Gem emits brilliant rays of light as you stand before the man. It appears he has great potential.|
23518|After handing the package to you, Felix starts out on his longer route.|
23519|Felix thanks you, and leaves for town carrying a backpack.|
23520|The Magic Snail reacts quickly to the magic substance. Quick, follow it!|
23521|The Magic Snail seems to have found something. Use your Shovel to investigate.|
23522|You've found the magic substance! Put it in your Backpack and take it to the Biologist.|
23523|After securing the Tiny Mushroom, you notice it doesn't smell very good. You'd better not give it to Shelton like this.|
23524|It might be best if you washed it in the Waterfall east of Rainmist Dell before bringing it to Shelton.|
23525|The Tiny Mushroom is much cleaner after being washed.|
23526|It's time to take the Tiny Mushroom to Shelton near the square of Rainmist Dell.|
23527|After praying for her life, Kathy zips off like a dart.|
23528|There are many foxes in the Haunted Passage. Explore the area with the fox to see if you can find any clues about its family.|
23529|"Ahhhh!" Strange noises come from the northwest.|
23530|Gripping her sword tightly, Lyla follows Ebazon, and steps out of sight.|
23531|Once you have entered the Research Institute, you can smell a strong odor of blood and rusted metal.|
23532|"Ahhhh!" Strange noises come from off in the distance. The sounds come from far off in the northwest. Could it be the fox's family?|
23533|The fox bounds over happily - he seems to have found his family!|
23534|The fox looks happy, but they all sound different...|
23535|Anyway, the fox and his family were reunited. Congratulations!|
23536|You hand the spores to the rabbit near the fire, and it hops with joy.|
23537|You hand the spores to the other rabbits, and they hop happily as well.|
23538|The rabbit trying to warm itself steps closer to the fire...|
23539|... and trips on a stick.|
23540|All the rabbit's spores fall into the fire!|
23541|The fire explodes into a full-blown conflagration!|
23542|The rabbits were frightened by the explosion and ran off.|
23543|Proudmoore was overcome with grief, and turned into a raging spirit.|
23544|You may be able to help Proudmoore by finding the Counter Magic Grimoire he was talking about.|
23545|The Counter Magic Grimoire seems to be hidden somewhere in the Avian Laboratory.|
23546|Proudmoore, now in mastery of the counterspell, defeated Uray.|
23547|His soul finally at peace, Proudmoore fades from sight.|
23548|After talking, Ebazon leaves in a hurry.|
23549|First find <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Ken so as not to alarm anyone.|
23550|There seems to be a commotion to your left. Go check it out!|
23551|Something is happening, wait and see...|
23552|Be careful not to alert the Marauders, or the captives will be in danger.|
23553|Talk to <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Sokka for an update.|
23554|You can hear the sounds of people and wagons up ahead...|
23555|The Investigation Squad has engaged the enemy - head back and support them!|
23556|The enemy base is up ahead - make sure you aren't spotted.|
23557|A shadowy figure emerges from the tunnel, howling with anger.|
23558|It's <Guard Captain> Drago! The destruction of the supply wagons has made him furious!|
23559|Defeat <Guard Captain> Drago!|
23560|Talk to <Investigation Team Lieutenant> Mandon to get the torch.|
23561|More haystacks need to be lit - keep going!|
23562|An enraged figure storms from the darkness of the tent...|
23563|Everyone, listen to my plan for the arson attacks...|
23564|There are no storehouses nearby - find a better place to set a fire. |
23565|Timantha has already asked the staff to help her set up.|
23566|The Forest Tanuki was drawn to the smell of the campfire.|
23567|The Forest Tanuki has grown tired of playing and gone home.|
23568|The bonfire has already gone out. The feast is over.|
23569|Place the detector north of Emerald Town|

23581|The Marauders have put out the burning haystacks. Light them again!|
23582|Ah?! (Where am I?)|
23583|Aaaaoooo! (I'm so hungry...)|
23584|In Fenrir's dream, he was so hungry that he had to scavenge for food.|
23585|If he gets hungry enough, he'll start eating people!|
23586|Fenrir will recover his full HP every time he bites a target.|
23587|Torian is upset because, in his dream, he's forgotten how to cook.|
23588|If left unchecked, his emotions will explode.|
23589|They must be destroyed before they cause any harm...|
23590|Please, try this food!|
23591|How... how can this be? I've never made this sort of mistake before...|
23592|This is my signature dish! How could I mess it up so badly?|
23593|No way! I must've made this a hundred times! This is impossible!|
23594|I must have been cursed...|
23595|This crocodile meat tastes like soap!|
23596|Gah! Why are there only stems in this stew?|
23597|Ahhh! It's so salty! Someone bring me some water, quick!|
23598|It's completely tasteless... didn't you add any salt?|
23599|Fish scales! So many fish scales!|
23600|Worms! Ewww!|
23601|Ah! Sharp bones! My tongue!|
23602|Why does this grilled escargot taste sweet...|
23603|It's overcooked and tough as a board!|
23604|Are you sure this is Dragon Leg Stew and not plaster stew?|
23605|Ack! Terrible!|
23606|Disgusting!|
23607|Daisy is waving as if she has something to tell you.|
23608|Go check on her.|
23609|You set up the detector and turn it on.|
23610|The detector emits a signal, and you spot an Ebon Drake nearby.|
23611|Even though the Drakes are still a ways away, you should still let Zachary know.|
23612|You set the detector up near the water, and turn it on.|
23613|The detector emits a signal - it appears to be working.|
23614|You set out the bait, and hide in a nearby bush.|
23615|An Emerald Iguana approaches, attracted by the smell.|
23616|It smells the food in the bag...|
23617|...and begins to feast.|
23618|Soon, more Emerald Iguanas appear.|
23619|They start to fight chaotically over the food.|
23620|It appears you've successfully distracted them.|
23621|Come back when their numbers decrease.|
23622|You have defeated the Karok Sorceress.|
23623|You say that it's useless to fight back, since all the Dark Gremlins have been defeated.|
23624|The Karok Sorceress appears to have made up her mind.|
23625|She drinks all the potion in the bottle.|
23626|She starts to transform, and a cloud of black mist surrounds her.|
23627|The black mist clears, and the sorceress has been transformed into a monster!|
23628|Karok Sorceress: Aaaaaaah!|
23629|Monstrous Karok Sorceress defeated.|
23630|You set down the crate containing the robot, and open it.|
23631|The robot walks out.|
23632|Robot: BEEP! Powering on.|
23633|Robot: Detecting swamp.|
23634|You feel a faint vibration.|
23635|Suddenly, the robot explodes!|
23636|There's something fishy going on - you should definitely report back to Pierre.|
23637|You insert the virus chip into the drone.|
23638|The robot makes disturbing sounds, and appears to be in a state of chaos.|
23639|Acey immediately takes out an adapter, and reprograms the drone.|
23640|Acey: Reprogramming success! This is now our drone patrol.|
23641|Acey: Let's get out of here before someone finds out...|
23642|Return and tell Abu that the drone has been reprogrammed.|
23643|Totem Pillar lit.|
23644|Black smoke pours from the Totem Pillar.|
23645|Return to Quincy and tell him about the burnt Totem.|
23646|You put down the box.|
23647|The Machine Gun Turret springs into activation.|
23648|Drone Patrol alerted.|
23649|You and Geno return to Emerald Village with the refugees. |
23650|You report back about Slim Sye's escape with the Scepter of Resurrection,
as well as the Gnome of Karok and the Dark Gremlin Egg.|
23651|It seems that Slim Sye is dead!|
23652|Prepare to fight the Gigantic Otter!|
23653|You watch from a nearby bush after setting the bait.|
23654|An Aqua Iguana approaches cautiously.|
23655|Talk to <Investigation Team Lieutenant> Erlar for an update.|
23656|Wait for the mole to arrive so that you can enter together.|
23657|You're too far away from your team! Learn to fight as one!|
23658|<Mage Commander> Barr appears!|
23659|Defeat <Mage Commander> Barr!|
23660|You hear voices from up ahead.|
23661|Fenrir woke up! And he's ravenously hungry!|
23662|It's still frightened and begins looking around for Torian.|
23663|Fenrir finds Torian, but Torian is still asleep! Something's wrong!|
23664|Fenrir runs to wake Torian up.|
23665|Torian's negative emotions swirl into a massive, seething nightmare!!|
23666|The nightmare is destroyed, but Torian remains asleep. Perhaps he needs one final wake-up call...|
23667|Destroy it and help Torian be rid of his nightmare for good!|
23668|The nightmare grows ever stronger. Now two negative emotions writhe and moan within it.|
23669|Quickly, destroy them both before they multiply again!|
23670|You'll find it where the resurrection is to be held. Hurry and destroy it! |

23685|Cadilla Felwood|
23686|You fill the Alchemy Bottle with Holy Water and bring it back to Rollena in the Smuggler's Cabin.|
23687|You defeat the otter and find a Fried Meatball.|
23688|You loot a corpse on the side of the road.|
23689|You find a soldier's Dog Tag, but the name is too faint to read.|
23690|A chill runs up your spine and you turn around to check for tails.|
23691|You report what you saw and the lack of ghosts to Alf.|
23692|Alf runs off screaming after his exorcism fails. |
23693|The ghost leaves after losing interest.|
23694|The various parts buried beneath the banner activate and begin transforming into a robot.|
23695|The robot completes its transformation fortified with the parts you gave it.|
23696|Something appears in the Glimmering Air. |
23697|The elf is purified and beautiful once more after using the Purity Powder.|
23698|The pollution causes the elf to mutate into a vicious beast! Defeat it and save the elf!|
23699|You read aloud the Sacred Prayer and a Magic Circle forms to purify the dead spirit.|
23700|You've successfully purified three dead spirits! Good job! Now the mage's work will be easier.|
23701|There are two demons in the cave. This must be the final trial that Aquila spoke of.|
23702|After defeating the demons, you are suddenly trapped by vines that spring from the ground!|
23703|A teleportation gateway has appeared in front of you! Ruth emerges from the gateway.|
23704|You try in vain to break free from the vines.|
23705|Ruth walks towards you, eyeing you hungrily!|
23706|She waves her hand, and a second Ruth suddenly appears before you.|
23707|When she leaves, the vines holding you in place also disappear.|
23708|The Shadow Knight's Elite Four were right in front of you! You have to let Aquila know about this as soon as possible!|
23709|You've destroyed five cars! Keep it up, you wrecking ball!|
23710|You've destroyed ten cars! You've got this, you master of smash!|
23711|You've destroyed fifteen cars! You're on fire! Go, go, go!|
23712|You've defeated five summoners! You are the meaning of chaos!|
23713|You've defeated ten summoners! Now the ceremony is really in trouble!|
23714|You've defeated fifteen summoners! They might as well stop the ceremony now!|
23715|Turbine Settlement Southwest Waterfall|
23716|East of Waterweed Wetland|
23717|South of Waterweed Wetland|
23718|Urazi shouts: "Medics, I want you collecting Windsoul Grass!"|
23719|Urazi shouts: "Guards, kill anything from Navea!"|
23720|Bruce: "We need Medicinal Herbs. Collect as many as you can while we distract the guards."|
23721|Urazi: "As if we could be taken down by the likes of Navean riffraff! Die, filth!"|
23722|Keep the medics from collecting Windsoul Grass by nabbing them first.|
23723|It sniffs the bag curiously, then bites into it.|
23724|The smell of blood wafts out of the bag.|
23725|Aqua Iguanas catch a whiff of the smell and begin moseying over.|
23726|The Aqua Iguanas begin fighting over the food.|
23727|Even the Aqua Iguana Boss joins the frenzy.|
23728|It seems like every single Aqua Iguana is now in the jumbled pandemonium in front of you.|
23729|The sight and smell is absolutely disgusting!|
23730|Report to Ronny when you're finished.|
23731|You follow the Sorceress for a while.|
23732|Several soldiers join the chase and you finally corner the Sorceress.|
23733|Sorceress: Almighty God... Please hear the wishes of your humble servant... |
23734|Sorceress: I give my life unto you in order to vanquish this enemy!|
23735|She quickly gulps something down.|
23736|A strange aura engulfs the Sorceress.|
23737|The Sorceress's form begins mutating...|
23738|Once the mists settle, the Sorceress's new form can be seen - a hideous, crazed beast!|
23739|Metamorphosed Sorceress: Kill...! KILL!|
23740|The Sorceress has gone mad! Getting any information out of her now would be a fool's errand.|
23741|You've got to take her out!|
23742|Defeat the Metamorphosed Sorceress!|
23743|You quickly scan the environs and decide this must be the place.|
23744|You carefully open the box and let out the robot.|
23745|BEEP! Initiate exploration protocol. Start investigation.|
23746|The robot slowly turns to the right.|
23747|Robot: BEEP! Investigating target...|
23748|Robot: Assorted scrap metal... no recyclable value...|
23749|It turns left towards another heap of scraps.|
23750|Robot: Assorted wood scraps... no usage whatsoever...|
23751|The robot suddenly stops and moves towards the middle of the area as if it's found something.|
23752|The ground shakes, and a beam of light shoots up towards the sky.|
23753|The Transforming Robot explodes and falls to pieces.|
23754|The robot's broken shell is partially melted from the astronomically high temperatures.|
23755|Report back to Pierre to see if he has any idea what's going on.|
23756|You leave quickly while the Aqua Iguanas are still fighting over the food.|
23757|You let out a sigh as you gaze down at the Karok Sorceress's body.|
23758|All you can do is tell Geno what happened.|
23759|Hurry back to the cart you're supposed to destroy!|
23760|Patrols are discussing the plans for their supply raid.|
23761|If you don't stay back, you might compromise the mole's identity.|
23762|The mushrooms in the area have been corrupted by the pollution, and attack anything they see.|
23763|Guard: "Blast! Fall back, men!"|
23764|Guards! Take them down! None shall escape!|
23765|Kill the summoners to prevent the resurrection of the Immemorial Beast! |
23766|Wonderful! The ceremony has been brought to a screeching halt!|
23767|Complete Cave of Trials|
23768|Quick! <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Bruce is waiting for you! Find him at once!|
23769|The Bonfire Feast has already started. Hurry to the Guild Hall.|
23770|Some kind of explosive must have caused this. |
23771|Defeat the Metamorphosed Sorceress before you leave!|
23772|Look at the robots, though... the investigation isn't over!|
23773|Sokka: Leave this here with us! You have our thanks.|
23774|<Investigation Team Captain> Griffin is just up ahead. Hurry!|
23775|Ask <Investigation Team Captain> Griffin about the current situation.|
23776|The barricades are down. Take out the enemy's frontlines! |
23777|You hear footsteps nearby.|
23778|Jessia: "We'll try to hold back the rest of the enemies while you take out the Energy Pillars!"|
23779|Jessia: "But those blasted things can repair themselves if they're not all destroyed within a five-second window."|
23780|Jessia: "The only way to take them out is to destroy them all as fast as possible."|
23781|Jessia: "That'll take out the Energy Furnace as well."|
23782|Badam: "You think you can just destroy the Energy Furnace? Don't make me laugh! I'll see you all in hell before I let you near that furnace!"|
23783|The Energy Pillars were not destroyed within five seconds. They have now repaired themselves.|
23784|The Energy Pillars have been destroyed, and the Energy Furnace has stopped!|
23785|Quick! <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Bruce is waiting for you! Find him at once!|
23786|You take the Energy Leaf Hookah out of the box with a puff of smoke.|
23787|The injured soldier seems to have recovered after breathing in the vapor.|
23788|The snail seems to sense something and moves forward.|
23789|The snail moves underground. It seems as though the Seal Sprout is the source of the magic interference.|
23790|It sounds like a brawl up ahead! You'd better go check it out.|
23791|Suddenly, an explosion wracks your ears. You don't know what happened.|
23792|You're able to concoct the antidote on your way back.|
23793|You make it back to the Rainmist Dell safely and give both Caresha and the Mage the antidote.|
23794|Everyone recovers from the charm thanks to the antidote.|
23795|A patient needs your help - go with Medic Zoy.|
23796|You sprinkle the Ghostly Dew in front of you, and the ghosts disappear.|
23797|You capture the Magic Town Wizard and hand him over to Odum.|
23798|You take the Avian Artifact from Odum and head over to Maya.|
23799|You release the snails just as Caresha told you to.|
23800|After defeating the Colorful Winged Fairy, use the kettle to collect the Butterfly Fairy Dew.|
23801|Use the Enhanced Glyphed Shackles on Shawn.|
23802|Shawn is free! But he's weakened - quick, defeat him!|
23803|You've defeated Shawn. Take him back to Brook for questioning. |
23804|The Fire Wall disappeared thanks to the enemy's retreat. Keep the pressure on them!|
23805|Try and catch Karok Sorceress Amos.|
23806|Watch out! A big otter appears from behind the bushes.|
23807|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'Cadilla Ruins.'"|
23808|Teleporter: "Attention! Opening the teleporting program! Destination is 'Smuggler's Cabin.'"|
23809|First, find <Investigation Team Squad Leader> Ken for information on the kidnapped miners.|
23810|You defeat <Guard Captain> Gheit and save the remaining captives for a successful mission!|
23811|The miners are fighting against the marauders! You must help them!|
23812|This is one of the marauders' warehouses where they keep their food.|
23813|There's a haystack out front. Why not try lighting it up?|
23814|Mandon hands you a torch.|
23815|Success! <Granary Commander> Karter has been vanquished thanks to everyone's efforts.|
23816|A shout comes from afar: What's going on here!?|
23817|Follow the instructions to place the combustibles. Once ignited, there will be a huge explosion!|
23818|Ignite the combustibles using the Torch. Remember, safety first!|
23819|<Guard Captain> Drago is defeated and the enemy's storage has been destroyed for a successful mission!|
23820|A shout comes from afar: Don't let them get away! C'mon, men!|
23821|Enemy soldiers come charging into the bedlam.|
23822|Good job! You've collected five blades of Windsoul Grass! Don't stop now!|
23823|You've collected eight blades of Windsoul Grass! Only two more to go!|
23824|Windsoul Grass is a medicinal herb. Help the Naveans by collecting as much as you can before the enemy does.|
23825|Help the Naveans destroy the enemy's Energy Furnace and keep them from making more weapons.|
23826|The resurrection is about to begin. Hurry, Erlar is waiting for you.|
23827|<Mage Commander> Barr has been defeated and a wrench has been thrown in the resurrection. A job well done!|
23828|<Medic Captain> Urazi has been defeated and the enemy's medical team has been stopped for good!|
23829|<Armory Manager> Badam has been defeated and the Energy Furnace is history!|
23830|Head east to Fel Town where you'll find Robinson and his scouts.|
23831|Replace Alex and question suspects in the Haunted Passage.|
23832|Head southwest to the Avian Laboratory where you might find some suspects.|
23833|Head west towards Cobweb Forest and meet up with Bessie and Ronny.|
23834|Meet Geno in the Cobweb Forest after you've defeated the Drone Patrol. |
23835|Carrick needs immediate assistance in the outskirts of the Turbine Settlement! Destroy Ebon Drake and then meet him ASAP!|
23836|Follow the escaped chief's footsteps over the waterfall to investigate, then meet up with Acey in the Waterweed Wetlands.|
23837|A great battle took place here. Many were wounded or killed.|
23838|The beast that guards this place seems to be a general. He must be defeated before you can pass.|
23839|Watch out! That supply cart is on fire! No need for human barbeque!|
23840|Another general is blocking your path. You'll need to defeat him!|
23841|You hear a multitude of marauder soldiers talking inside.|
23842|The enemy soldiers dare to stand in your way! Take them out!|
23843|Now the Marauder Chief has joined the brawl. Take him out to end this fight for good.|
23844|<Marauder Chief> Lasas has been defeated! At long last, the war has come to an end.|
23845|Kuba: "This is my territory - don't expect to make it out alive!"|
23846|Garnett: "Puny humans! You'll learn just how weak you are!"|
23847|Lasas: "You think you can prevent us from conquering this land?"|
23848|Mole: Okay, this is the place. My mission is complete!|
23849|I'll leave sabotaging the ceremony to you guys...|
23850|The explosives are wet and can't be lit.|
23851|Barr: You dare interrupt our ceremony? Prepare to die!|
23852|Barr: Get over here!|
23853|The burning haystacks are making it hard to breathe.|
23854|You choke on the thick smoke from the burning haystacks. |
23855|Unconscious soldiers are strewn everywhere. It appears to be Alex's third squad.|
23856|There's a suspicious shadow ahead - perhaps it's what knocked out the soldiers!|
23857|Upon entering, you discover that numerous Mages are casting spells on the Titan Mushroom.|
23858|At Titan's Root, you find Odum and Alex's troops.|
23859|They've set up a temporary camp and appear ready to launch an attack.|
23860|The mushrooms here are very unusual-looking.|
23861|You sense a strong being... stronger than the ones you just fought.|
23862|Mushroom Titan: Intruders! Leave Titan at once!|
23863|Alex: We'll deal with this. You're pretty quick on your feet. Hurry and find the Second Prince.|
23864|You sense radiating waves of magic ahead. Perhaps the Second Prince is there.|
23865|Magic energy pulsates strongly. You see the second prince, tied up on the altar. |
23866|You feel the energy from the altar washing over you. You know you must now face...|
23867|"Agh! More rats have found their way in here, eh?" |
23868|"I'll just have to take care of you myself!"|
23869|The Winged Duke's power suddenly drops, freeing the Second Prince.|
23870|Odum and Alex have arrived!|
23871|Suddenly, the Winged Duke casts a spell that draws out the souls of nearby soldiers.|
23872|The Winged Duke disappears in a cloud of black smoke and transports to Titan's Root, cloaked in darkness.|
23873|The space ahead gives you an uneasy feeling... much like when you encountered the Charm Queen.|
23874|Suddenly, a swarm of Canyon Crawlers emerges from the ground and surrounds you!|
23875|"Hee hee... hello again!"|
23876|"I hadn't seen you for awhile - I was getting worried!"|
23877|Perhaps together you can overcome the Charm Queen.|
23878|"Charm Queen...!"|
23879|The Second Prince approaches the Charm Queen, seething with anger.|
23880|"Ruth! Is that all you've got?"|
23881|"I won't let them kill you, even if you let me down."|
23882|Suddenly, with a surge of black magic, the Winged Duke appears next to the Second Prince and the Queen.|
23883|The Winged Duke casts a spell, absorbing the powers of both.|
23884|The Winged Duke evolves into an unholy beast like no other.|
23885|The Winged Duke seethes with god-like power as he leers down at everyone.|
23886|Odum appears stunned as he stumbles over to the Second Prince's body. |
23887|Odum doesn't respond. He simply stares down at the body.|
23888|Alex says he will stay and look after Odum. You should report back to the Grand Bishop.|
23889|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Ruth was defeated.|
23890|A treasure chest mysteriously appeared after Gainey was defeated.|
23891|Turbine Settlement Southwest Pond|
23892|Drone Patrol-X strikes! Insert the Virus Chip now!|
23893|You see many giants lumbering about up ahead.|
23894|There's something about them that's different from giants you've seen before.|
23895|Better tell Acey about this!|
23896|The Glyphed Shackles! How can it be?|
23897|Think a mere rune can defeat me? How naive...|
23898|Take Acey and find the Dimensional Fissure.|
23899|Defeat the Dimensional Giant King from the Dimensional Fissure!|
23900|Victoria appears along with soldiers from the Church.|
23901|Victoria seals the Dimensional Fissure using the scepter.|
23902|You bring Acey to where the corpse of the Karok Chief was found.|
23903|Let Acey inspect the location of the Dimensional Fissure.|
23904|Who knows what would have happened if Victoria hadn't sealed the Dimensional Fissure.|
23905|You're a bit curious as to what Puckett is doing here...|
23906|Alex asks you to dive into the fray and help Odum fight.|
23907|Odum and his team are battling a giant monster up ahead!|
23908|Alex: I'm coming to your aid!|
23909|Another Mushroom Titan has emerged from the ground and blocked the path!|
23910|Church Troops have established a provisional base at the entrance to Cadilla Felwood. There's a fierce battle being fought up ahead.|
23911|The incantation of a curse can be heard up ahead.|
23912|This raging fire is fueled by the magic of the Karok Soulmaster.|
23913|The Karok Soulmaster has died, and the raging fire has subsided.|
23914|An Ancient Demon Soldier has been resurrected from the pile of skeletons.|
23915|The ground is strewn with soldier and monster corpses. The soldiers must have already charged in...|
23916|Victoria, who was thought to be dead, suddenly appears in the corner.|
23917|There are only a few corpses here. It looks like the soldiers were able to take this area without meeting too much resistance.|
23918|You return to the Smuggler's Cabin via the Portal, and pass on the military intelligence report to Victoria.|
23919|You then join Victoria and Puckett in removing the seal from the entrance to Cadilla Felwood.|
23920|Under Puckett's lead, the three of you reach the borders of Cadilla Felwood.|
23921|You haven't yet removed the seal, so you can't head back to the ranch yet.|
23922|Puckett: I seem to recall a large fruit tree growing near the portal.|
23923|We've already been down this road. We should try another...|
23924|Puckett: Go take a look, then come back and tell me which road to take.|
23925|Puckett: Ah! It's a Frenzied Ogre! We shouldn't take this road...|
23926|The road is blocked by a barrier! We'll have to go back and find the correct route.|
23927|The group uses a Portal to travel to their destination.|
23928|A black mist barrier and a strange crystal appear before you, blocking the way.|
23929|Follow Puckett to find the switch to turn off the crystal.|
23930|Oh, no - that was the wrong switch! It's opened a secret portal and summoned a Frenzied Ogre!|
23931|Screech! The switch has come loose.|
23932|This looks like a switch. Try turning it on.|
23933|Turn on the switch! Maybe a miracle will happen...|
23934|A black mist barrier has blocked the road. It's impossible to get through.|
23935|We're on the right track. This no time to give up and head back!|
23936|The road is blocked by a black mist barrier, held in place by the crystal.|
23937|Follow the Soulless Snail to see where it goes.|
23938|This is the place. Defeat the Seal Sprout to remove the source of the magic interference.|
23939|You hear the calm, familiar voice of a commander. Tatiana must be nearby...|
23940|This place hides an abnormal, suppressed energy. The surrounding ghosts look like a troop of Warlocks.|
23941|Thank you. I'm finally free...|
23942|Find where the treasure is hidden.|
23943|The summoning ritual unsettles me. I can't let them cut off our escape route...|
23944|There's still some water in the kettle. Pour it out, then give the kettle to Maya.|
23945|The treasure's hiding place has been discovered! Hurry back and inform Clerk Mirabelle.|
23946|Find the pirates' treasure.|
23947|Wait for Puckett and Victoria. Don't be rash and go it alone!|
23948|This may just be a normal tablet. Let Puckett identify it.|
23949|After the entrance was unsealed, the group entered Cadilla Felwood.|
23950|How are we going to remove the seal?|
23951|The seal has made you feel very ill!|
23952|Ghost Assembly Point|
23953|There's a young man from Emerald Town up ahead. Go question him.|
23954|Victoria deals a powerful strike, stopping the Demon Glutton in its tracks and dealing a fatal blow.|
23955|Watch out!!!|
23956|There is a strong magic pulse ahead!|
23957|It looks like a fierce battle was fought here not long ago.|
23958|Click on the tree in front of you to see if it's the one that Puckett described.|
23959|Failed! Talk to Puckett for the next selection.|
23960|The Fragrant Monstrosity, Fish King of the Rainmist Reach, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
23961|The Lake Lurker, Fish King of Emerald Marsh, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should so quickly!|
23962|The Fish King of Starstruck Plateau, an unidentified creature, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should do so quickly!|
23963|The Fish King of Silent Ice Field, Eternal Glacier, has appeared! Anglers with the will and skill to challenge this mighty fish should do so quickly!|
23964|The Karok Berserkers are heavily wounded. It will take some time for them to recover.|
23965|Lead the soldiers on an offensive while the Karok Berserkers are wounded.|
23966|Just when it looks like you're surrounded by the Karok Berserkers, someone throws a smoke bomb!|
23967|Chaos breaks out, giving the soliders the chance to flee.|
23968|The soldiers are raring to go. Join them and attack Turbine Settlement!|
23969|The soldiers have been frozen in place by the Karok Sorcerer's curse.|
23970|Para Ryan: Well, well... you've turned me into a mushroom! Once I've dealt with the Charm Queen, I'll turn you into one too, and set you out to dry in the middle of the Ventos Tribe.|
23971|It... it's still evolving. Did I underestimate the power of the Winged Duke?|
23972|The Winged Duke has gained the "Scarlet Arcane" power. Use the Scarlet Magic Circle to remove it.|
23973|The Winged Duke has gained the "Blue Arcane" power. Use the Blue Magic Circle to remove it.|
23974|The Winged Duke has gained the "Azure Arcane" power. Use the Azure Magic Circle to remove it.|
23975|The Winged Duke has gained the "Golden Arcane" power. Use the Golden Magic Circle to remove it.|
23976|This mushroom has a unique smell, which catches your attention.|
23977|You're covered with Spore powder. You've turned into a mushroom...|
23978|You've inhaled Spore powder. Your muscles start to transform. You've turned into a mushroom!|
23979|You've wounded a mushroom. The nearby mushroom spirits are angry, and they start to advance on you...|
23980|The Second Prince has turned into a mushroom, but he should be back to normal soon... hopefully.|
23981|You pick a mushroom, and a new mushroom pops up in its place.|
23982|It would be better to do something more meaningful...|
23983|... I think I'd better do something a bit more meaningful... like help Odum and Alex.|
23984|I'm not sure whether to continue with this mindless task...|
23985|Pick mushrooms? Great! That's just what I wanted to do.|
23986|To be honest, I want to punch myself...|
23987|Ah - take this!|
23988|Amidst the low chanting of curses, a huge skull emerges from the Magic Circle.|
23989|The Mutated Spider King has discovered you and Victoria. It's attacking!|
23990|The ground trembles, and the Demon Glutton emerges from the soil.|
23991|Use Puckett's directions to find the portal to Cadilla Felwood.|
23992|You've already closed the barrier. Follow the lights to the red arrow.|
23993|Victoria raises her sword and mutters something you don't understand.|
23994|Victoria works her magic. The seal disappears before your eyes!|
23995|The Demon Glutton utters a curse with his dying breath. The ground begins to tremble...|
23996|Capture the Fleeing Fledgling on the roof.|
23997|Powerful black magic prevents you from passing through this barrier. You'll have to find another solution.|
23998|Ugh... my head hurts... I hate this feeling.|
23999|As Victoria moves, burning meteors fall from the sky onto the seal.|
24000|At the root of Titan's Grove, all looks green and peaceful.|
24001|But you can sense, from the evil magic in the air, that this spot has been invaded and polluted.|
24002|The Tree Dryad, native to Titan's Grove, is the guardian of this area.|
24003|But he's been corrupted by the black magic of the Demon Apprentices, and joined the forces of evil.|
24004|A wave of darkness rolls in from up ahead. You see an altar at the end of the corridor.|
24005|The closer you draw to the altar, the more you can feel the pulsation of a dark energy. You're no stranger to this kind of energy...|
24006|The altar is producing three forms of dark energy. They gather in the vacant space next to it, then disperse. |
24007|"Huh! Evil souls really do refuse to die!"|
24008|"You self-proclaimed warriors of justice are always foiling our plans."|
24009|"Bombing the water cave's gate has destroyed the magical source in Ghostweep Cave. There are all sorts of obstructions..."|
24010|"But now I grow tired of your despicable little tricks..."|
24011|"So I've decided to deal with you once and for all!"|
24012|The Winged Duke springs into action. Suddenly, he becomes surrounded by a dark force, then disappears without a trace.|
24013|Two clumps of mushrooms in the center emit an unpleasant aroma.|
24014|Mushroom Titan: You've damaged the mushrooms... you evil... get out... of Titan's Grove!|
24015|The Mushroom Titan senses that his fellow mushrooms have been attacked. He emerges from the ground, trembling with anger!|
24016|Mushroom Titan: Danger... help... Grrraah!|
24017|The earth shakes again, and another Mushroom Titan emerges from the ground to join the battle.|
24018|"Haha! This is a real party!"|
24019|"Seeing as everyone's just bursting with energy, why don't you play with these children?"|
24020|"So violent! You don't know where to draw the line, do you?"|
24021|"Come, then.... allow me to teach you!"|
24022|"That's just my phantom! Hahaha!"|
24023|"No... how... this is not in the script..."|
24024|The Charm Queen finally falls under the force of your attack.|
24025|Her power disperses, shaking Titan's Root to its core.|
24026|Once the shaking subsides, the Charm Queen vanishes. In her place, a bed of red flowers covers the ground.|
24027|On both sides, objects that look like egg sacs start to pulsate, as if alive.|
24028|There are egg sacs and little spiders everywhere. I have a feeling...|
24029|A Careless Karok Gnome approaches to inspect the egg sacs.|
24030|Victoria casts a spell to open a portal.|
24031|The Demon Glutton collapses after suffering a fatal blow from Victoria.|
24032|Jerry breaks into spasms of laughter and then disappears.|
24033|This is just a normal stone.|
24034|Please defeat the Frenzied Ogres quickly!|
24035|Please activate the tablet switch next to Puckett.|
24036|The switch to turn off the crystal is next to Puckett.|
24037|Victoria looks tired, but she is as swift and sure-footed as ever.|
24038|After the Mushroom Titans have bitten the dust, a familiar female voice rings out across Titan's Root.|
24039|As soon as the Charm Queen stops talking, a swarm of Canyon Crawlers emerge from underground!|
24040|To catch up with Victoria and Puckett., you need to follow the lights to the Portal.|
24041|Break open the wine barrel to attract the Phantom Bunnyhops.|
24042|The Phantom Bunnyhops sense the wine! Here they come!|
24043|The sober Bunnyhop moves like a cheetah! You'll never catch it!|
24044|But once drunk, you might just have a chance.|
24045|You hear the sound of a far-off wolf!|
24046|Fenrir gulps down the puddle of Intoxicating Wine.|
24047|The Phantom Bunnyhops will go back into hiding once the wine is gone. |
24048|You'll need to feed Fenrir something to get him to stop drinking.|
24049|Suddenly, a Karok Sorcerer appears and casts a strange spell.|
24050|Oh, no! We've walked right into the Karok Berserkers' ambush!|
24051|A plume of smoke rises, interrupting the Karok Sorcerer's spell.|
24052|Acey stares at the detector in his hands, trying to determine the position of the Dimensional Fissure.|
24053|A powerful Energy is emanating from the Dimensional Fissure. You have to be careful!|
24054|While Acey puzzles over how to deal with the Dimensional Fissure, a wave of magic flows by.|
24055|Victoria mutters something under her breath and then commences work on the Dimensional Fissure.|
24056|There's a fork in the road up ahead. One path leads to the Portal left by the demon camp.|
24057|This looks like the wrong path.|
24058|It looks like the middle path is the one to take.|
24059|This looks like the tree that Puckett is looking for.|
24060|This is the wrong direction! You need to attack the Turbine Settlement with the soldiers!|
24061|The Charm Queen activates the Arcane Teleport Gate. A horde of minions appear to fight for her!|
24062|The Tree Guards have arrived. Defeat them to break through the Charm Queen's defenses. |
24063|The Charm Queen condenses perfume to spray on marked targets.|
24064|The Ancient Demon General has awoken the Skeletal Ghost. The Skeletal Ghost will curse those affected by the Ghostly Grudge.|
24065|A nest of Self-Destructing Spiders has hatched. Steer clear of the damage they can inflict!|
24066|A nest of Thrashing Spiders has hatched. Their attacks inflict a debuff that makes you receive more damage.|
24067|A nest of Infected Spiders has hatched. If you get too close, your stats will drop.|
24068|The Demon Glutton has sent Gluttony's Slaves. Killing the Slaves will restore the Demon Glutton's HP.|
24069|The Demon Glutton has whipped the remaining Gluttony's Slaves into a frenzy!|
24070|The Demon Glutton drinks the blood of fallen Gluttony's Slaves to recover HP.|
24071|Just as you start to despair that the Mushrooms will never sprout, a Yellow Mushroom pushes out of the soil.|
24072|Charm Queen: Come closer! I've been waiting for you for ages!|
24073|"That's just my mirage! Hahaha!"|
24074|"How dare you be so disobedient?"|
24075|"I have an important mission to complete, but you just keep getting in the way..."|
24076|"So, I'll just have to...well, you know!"|
24077|In the midst of the chaos, someone reaches out and saves you from the smoke.|
24078|The Mutated Spider King has awoken. He certainly looks hungry.|
24079|The ground shakes as the Demon Glutton emerges from the earth.|
24080|Thanks to everyone here, the Demon Glutton has finally been vanquished! The Portal is now open.|
24081|Water the cherry tree.|
24082|Use Fertilizer on the cherry three.|
24083|Follow Victoria to the next battlefield and decide on your next move. |
24084|The Phantom Bunnyhops will go back into hiding once the dream wine is gone.|
24085|Fenrir is too full to even move!|
24086|You've found Shawn! Use the Enhanced Glyphed Shackles on him to seal his power.|
24087|An enraged scream comes from the Burlap Sack. Shawn struggles fiercely in an attempt to impede your progress.|
24088|Shawn's antics won't stop you, though. You decide to hand him off for Brook to deal with.|
24089|The air starts to vibrate as the Secret Chest appears.|
24090|Shirayuki: "I thought it was someone else..."|
24091|Shirayuki appears in the falling snow.|
24092|Shirayuki: "The Secret Treasure is extremely valuable. Forgive me for not allowing you to take it."|
24093|Shirayuki: "Be careful."|
24094|The appearance of the Secret Treasure destabilizes the force field.|
24095|Kaiser Zeta: "Halt, thieves!"|
24096|Kaiser Zeta descends, enveloped in light.|
24097|Kaiser Zeta: "I won't let you lay your hands on the Secret Treasure!"|
24098|Kaiser Zeta: "Take this!"|
24099|A treasure chest appears in the wake of Ruth's defeat.|
24100|Emotions are running high as the area buzzes with activity.|
24101|After undergoing many challenges, you are finally on your way to confront the Winged Duke.|
24102|You, Odum, and Alex prepare yourselves as you await his arrival.|
24103|Challenge and defeat the Winged Duke with Odum and Alex!|
24104|The demonic beast guards have spotted you, and they launch an attack!|
24105|Suddenly, in a burst of dark energy, the Winged Duke appears.|
24106|You'll pay your debt to the Second Prince with your life!|
24107|Maya: "Hee hee! Where are you heading in such a hurry?|
24108|Report to <Left-Wing Butterfly> Maya.|
24109|You've caught <Horned Slayer> Gullah. Retrieve the egg and give it to Guard Rocky!|
24110|You've caught <Hell Hound> Blessa. Retrieve the urn and give it to Guard Rocky!|
24111|You've caught <Spiteful Skeleton> Mandisa. Retrieve the urn and give it to Guard Rocky!|
24112|You've caught <Sanguine Wing> Olmino. Retrieve the crate and give it to Guard Rocky!|
24113|You caught <Raging Blizzard> Roli. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Doppler!|
24114|You caught <Shrouded> Ranya. Go pick up the crate and give it to Guard Doppler!|
24115|You caught <Chaos Conjurer> Naliya. Go pick up the urn and give it to Guard Doppler!|
24116|You caught <Bigfoot> Biggof. Go pick up the urn and give it to Guard Doppler!|
24117|Tobin: Don't... don't just leave me here!"|
24118|Report to Tafay Chief Tobin.|
24119|Talk to the Cursed Frog. See what it has to say about the next step.|
24120|When the Cursed Frog has finished talking, it disappears into the weeds.|
24121|You bend down and kiss the frog.|
24122|The frog shines with dazzling light as it turns into a fair maiden.|
24123|The frog shines with dazzling light as it turns into a fair maiden.|
24124|After speaking with you, the maiden picks up her bow again.|
24125|After speaking with you, the teenager picks up his bow again.|
24126|According to the Orb Compass, the Orb Fragments should be nearby.|
24127|Jason summons an unknown creature using the synthesized orb.|
24128|After speaking, the demon casts a teleportation spell and disappears.|
24129|Jason mutters something unintelligible and runs off.|
24130|With her hands trembling, Velisha wields the sword and attacks the Forest Tanuki.|
24131|Velisha collapses with exhaustion as you fire her weapon.|
24132|You use the Firebreath Wand to destroy the Incantation Totem.|
24133|The Forest Tanuki turns to Velisha and begins explaining the importance of nature and the preciousness of life.|
24134|The Forest Tanuki also stresses the need for mutual cooperation between humans and nature.|
24135|After a while, your head starts to feel heavy and you nod off to sleep.|
24136|When you awaken, Velisha and the Forest Tanuki are gone. How strange...|
24137|After speaking, the demon takes the Sword of the King and disappears.|
24138|The yeti seems happy to follow you. Lead him back to Buzz!|
24139|After he finishes talking, Buzz throws the ball.|
24140|You successfully planted the banner at the meteor crater. Troop morale is at an all-time high!|
24141|After eating the apple, Jonissa turns into a Snow Sprite.|
24142|The Dragonwing has fully recovered after using the energy tonic.|
24143|The mysterious stone falls into place, and you can hear something move deep within the mechanism.|
24144|You can place a Photography Crystal here.|
24145|You sound the horn, and it echoes across the valley. Unsure whether this did the trick, you blow the horn a second time.|
24146|After blowing the horn a third time, an angry bear appears from nowhere and attacks.|
24147|You solemnly pray to the Goddess Statue, but nothing happens.|
24148|According to the inscription on the statue, if someone cleanses the Sacred Beast Statue and then prays, something will happen.|
24149|A voice rings out from the heavens: "Thank you for your assistance, but no blessings shall be bestowed upon the irreverent."|
24150|The Furious Goddess Servitor appears in response to your desecration of the holy statue.|
24151|You have earned the Goddess Statue's blessings as a reward for your kind and selfless efforts.|
24152|The bluebird happily returns to its owner.|
24153|Forest Tanuki: Human! I can sense that you are a kind-hearted soul. Can you do me a favor and calm her down?|
24154|The teary-eyed maiden speaks to you happily.|
24155|The teenager gleefully grabs your hand.|
24156|Velisha reluctantly reaches down to pick a nearby flower.|
24157|Before Velisha can pick the flower, a Forest Tanuki appears.|
24158|Velisha leaps back in fright and prepares for an attack.|
24159|You sheathe your weapon and look at the Forest Tanuki.|
24160|You tell the Yeti about Buzz.|
24161|Jonissa happily grabs the apple and takes a bite.|
24162|You place your hand on the sword and remove it effortlessly.|
24163|You spot a soldier grilling something nearby. You think he may know something about the bluebird, so you ask him.|
24164|You've found the dead body of an adventurer on the side of the road. Go bury it.|
24165|You can hardly believe what happens next.|
24166|You throw the dry firewood into the campfire, which starts crackling away happily.|
24167|The campfire's special energy has the Forest Tanuki all dancing around in a joyous circle.|
24168|Collect 3 Dry Firewood|
24169|The Forest Tanuki's Campfire is burning fiercely. The fire will last for 30 minutes.|
24170|The water purifier starts to cleanse the poison marsh.|
24171|As the poison marsh disappears, the gate to the reservoir opens up.|
24172|A gigantic machine, guardian of the reservoir, falls from the sky. The room begins to fill with poison gas.|
24173|As the gigantic machine is destroyed, peace is restored to the reservoir.|
24174|Your hear spells being chanted in the distance. A large number of priests are guarding the area. There must be a ritual taking place.|
24175|As the priest before you casts an unknown spell, another priest suddenly starts to radiate extraordinary power.|
24176|The priests are holding a mysterious ceremony. Something seems amiss here...|
24177|Dive into the depths of this forsaken place and stop the priests as soon as possible.|

24188|Rehia Found|
24189|Moe Found|
24190|The enraged Winged Duke summons dimensional lightning and thunder.|
24191|Anyone struck by the dimensional powers will have higher Dark DMG.|
24192|You prepare yourself for the final blow that will conquer this evil once and for all.|
24193|It's just as you thought! The Winged Duke uses the same tricks on you as he did on the Second Prince!|
24194|After much hard work, the Winged Duke has been found!|
24195|After some brief preparations, you, Odum, and Alex make your way to the northwest corner of Highland Cemetery along with the troops.|
24196|At this critical moment, Odum uses all his strength to break free of the Winged Duke's control.|
24197|The Winged Duke disappears, but you can still feel his presence - malignant and omniscient.|
24198|You fight the good fight, and after a long, grueling battle, you finally emerge victorious. The Duke, now sluggish and powerless, has been defeated.|
24199|Just as you're about to congratulate yourself on a job well done, you feel an intense, chaotic energy permeate the air.|
24200|A powerful whirlwind of sparkling energy enshrouds the Winged Duke. It lasts not but a moment or two before dissipating, but upon its departure, you discover the Winged Duke is nowhere to be found.|
24201|Another army of beasts appears. You'll have to defeat them to coerce the dastardly Winged Duke to come out of hiding!|

24225|The Church's soldiers are currently duking it out with the monsters in the cave.|
24226|You notice the edges of a Magic Circle glimmering on the ground. All of a sudden, the very center of the circle begins to undulate...|
24227|System Activated; Charging Initiated. Please wait...|
24228|System overload. Activating auto-fire sequence. System will self-destruct in 1 second.|
24229|Andre dashes forward and slips inside just before the Dimensional Fissure closes!|
24230|Andre: "Just where do you think YOU'RE going?!"|
24231|Von: "Cloddish troglodyte! Prepare to meet your doom! Feast your eyes upon my visage! Cower before my unholy power!"|
24232|You hear the sound of fighting from up ahead.|
24233|The fierce storm of ice that had previously been blocking the path calms to a lull upon Guzigla's death.|

24244|You think about what might have happened that requires your assistance.
A multitude of questions clouds your mind as you make your way towards Hurd Military Base.|
24245|Everything will be made clear once you speak with Shay.|
24246|The anticipation, however, is killing you, so you quickly hurry towards the base.|
24247|The traitor seems unwilling to surrender, so you slam your letter down in front of him.|
24248|Could it be? A flash of remorse? Your persuasion tactics have proved successful!|
24249|Hm, seems like he still won't budge. Take him out!|
24250|You carefully kindle a tiny flame and use it to set fire to the trash pile.|
24251|Keep burning more trash! Let's see those flames lick the sky!|
24252|You burn another pile of trash. The flames are soaring!|
24253|More, more, more! Let's build a raging inferno!|
24254|You've burned so much trash, the fire is now out of control! What magnificent conflagration!|
24255|Report back to Mia about your successful arson.|
24256|Sharuti thanks you for recovering Palo's weapon.|
24257|You rest for a while before deciding to head out.|
24258|Head back to the Starstruck Plateau base and tell Caresha about what happened.|
24259|Von suddenly emerges from the Dimensional Fissure, and the air around you grows cold.|
24260|Von: "YAAAAARGH!!!"|
24261|Von lets out an earth-shattering roar and mutates into an enormous dragon of ice.|
24262|The Winged Duke springs into action and uses his infernal power to wrangle the lot of you into his grasp.|
24263|All of a sudden, a bolt of lightning crackles through the air, interrupting Von's concentration.|
24264|The three Dragon Kings of Thunder, Gale, and, Deluge, appear in front of you.|
24265|The Winged Duke reappears! Waves of crushing energy undulate from his every pore.|
24266|The Shadow Knight uses the Cube of Gaia to begin Luciana's resurrection ritual.|
24267|Just as the Shadow Knight glances away, Victoria rushes forward towards Luciana.|
24268|The Magic Circle, however, stops her in her tracks.|
24269|Maggie focuses all of her energy into casting a powerful spell.|
24270|The spell kills Maggie and the soldiers, and the Shadow Knight is able to escape.|
24271|Let's go! We must stop the Shadow Knight!|
24272|Yaaahh--!!|
24273|You follow closely behind the Winged Duke, not wanting to lose him, as you begin storing up energy.|
24274|You can't help but think back to your fight against Frederic the Archangel in Wrathborne Temple - this time will be no different!|
24275|So many memories come rushing back as you walk amongst the tribe you once knew so well.|
24276|But those wonderful memories are gone. That despicable traitor has destroyed everything!|
24277|The time for justice is nigh, and you shall be the one to stamp, mail, and deliver it!|
24278|You know just where to find him, too.|
24279|In the main tent - the one normally reserved for the chief.|
24280|You follow the signs along the path.|
24281|All of a sudden, one of the guards from up ahead spots you.|
24282|Stop right there! Just what do you think you're doing here?|
24283|I'll claw out your trachea, scum!|
24284|Don't think you're getting out of here alive!|
24285|This relentless band of traitors isn't going to give up! Go punish them.|
24286|You're in the process of cleaning your weapon from the kill when you hear a voice from behind you. It's laden with disdain.|
24287|Oh, if it isn't Klaus!|
24288|And so SKILLED, yes? Someone's been diligent in their training.|
24289|But alas, it won't be enough. Consider it an honor to fall before me...|
24290|Or are you going to run away again, just like the little dog you are?!|
24291|You'll pay for what you've done here, traitor!|
24292|Take out the leader of the Silverflash Tribe Traitors!|
24293|You watch the foul infidel fall to the ground in a heap. Just as you're taking a breath of relief, you hear footsteps approach from behind you...|
24294|Shay looks forlornly at the corpse.|
24295|Not even those of great strength can resist the lure of power and prestige.|
24296|Perhaps, now, those that suffered thanks to his tyranny will be able to rest in peace...|
24297|You nod to Shay in agreement.|
24298|The quest is complete, and it's time to return to Hurd Military Base.|
24299|You feel like a giant weight has been lifted off your shoulders as you walk.|
24300|It wasn't easy, but you were able to pull off the mission without a hitch.|
24301|Unbeknownst to you, however, the traitor still lurks...|
24302|As you pour the Forest Essence into the brazier, you feel it begin to grow warm.|
24303|You pour more and more of the essence into the brazier.|
24304|The more your pour, the warmer it grows, and the flame billows and expands.|
24305|Tell Erika that the flames in the brazier have grown larger.|
24306|The soldier thanks you for killing the Aerial Scouts and saving his life.|
24307|The soldier thanks you for killing the Aerial Raiders and saving him.|
24308|Keep it up! Take out as many Aerial Scouts and Raiders as you can!|
24309|By order of the Shadow Knight, you shall perish! Time to kiss this world goodbye, Maggie!|
24310|The Aerial Assassin, it's--!! Coming straight towards you!|
24311|Quickly! Take out the Aerial Assassin!|
24312|The Snowmountain Yeti is furious right now. You'd better get yourself a Tattooed Yeti disguise before you head over.|
24313|You quickly replace the damaged energy core with a new one.|
24314|The pilot checks the energy levels again, then thanks you before returning to the fight.|
24315|I'm incredibly grateful. Now I can carry on with my fight!|
24316|You open the detector, and everything seems to be in order. You hide it away in a corner where no one will find it.|
24317|Install the detector on the right side of the Dark Fortress.|
24318|You open the detector, and everything seems to be in order. You hide it away in a corner where no one will find it.|
24319|You finish setting up the Detector. Hurry back and report to Augustus!|
24320|Teleporter: "Commencing teleportation sequence. Destination: Ice Crystal Forest."|
24321|Teleporter: "Commencing teleportation sequence. Destination: Silent Mountain."|
24322|Teleporter: "Commencing teleportation sequence. Destination: Dark Fortress Bridge."|
24323|You ignite the smoke bomb and gently place it into the pen.|
24324|Dashing away, you hide yourself in some nearby bushes to watch the events unfold.|
24325|The boars don't seem to notice the smoke at first, merely bumbling about and busying themselves as usual.|
24326|Finally, one of the boars notices the billowing smoke and wanders over to investigate.|
24327|A few of the boars begin bickering, still others stand around, sniffing the air and glancing at each other curiously.|
24328|As the smoke continues to thicken, you notice a change in the boars' mannerisms.|
24329|They grow sluggish, languid, and finally, fall asleep one by one, snoring loudly.|
24330|Mission success! The boars are all fast asleep, and they won't be waking up any time soon.|
24331|Patting yourself on the back, you decide to head out.|
24332|You sneak away from your hiding spot to avoid being spotted by the guards.|
24333|You should report to Klaus and tell him you successfully incapacitated the boars.|
24334|The Inscribed Magic Circle pulses with increasing intensity, as though trying to offset the power of the Anti-Magic Rune.|
24335|You cautiously approach the center of the Inscribed Magic Circle, readying the Anti-Magic Rune.|
24336|Suddenly the Anti-Magic Rune begins to glow, shining brightly as it floats toward the center of the circle.|
24337|The two streams of energy collide, creating a series of blinding light beams.|
24338|The rune purges the dark magic, steadily weakening the power of the Magic Circle.|
24339|The light from the rune shimmers as it cleanses the area of any and all residual dark magic.|
24340|Finally, the two energy streams fizzle out with identical hisses, leaving behind nothing but traces of clean, holy energy.|
24341|Finally the dark magic is extinguished, and the Circle is completely destroyed.|
24342|Gone are the palpitatious energy pulses, and gone is the claustrophobic pressure that had grown tight around your lungs.|
24343|Now that the circle is no more, you decide it's high time you vacated the premises.|
24344|Carefully avoiding detection, you make your way back to base.|
24345|You should quickly find Alex and tell him of the circle's destruction.|
24346|After confirming the teleportation spell's location with Maggie, you take the rune there.|
24347|The Darkwing Servants and their master, the Darkwing Steward, have the teleportation spell. Find them and destroy them!|
24348|The spell should be somewhere towards the front, but the Darkwing Steward will no doubt be behind the Dark Mist Wall.|
24349|Darkwing Servants lurk nearby, lending their power to the spell. You must defeat them to destroy the Dark Mist Wall!|
24350|Take out the Darkwing Servants before facing the Darkwing Steward.|
24351|As you approach, several Darkwing Servants spot you, giving loud shrieks as they swoop to block your path.|
24352|Take out every single one of those Darkwing varmints!|
24353|You watch the final Darkwing Servant fall to the ground with a thud, and almost immediately, the Dark Mist Wall fizzles into nothingness.|
24354|Now, only the Darkwing Steward remains...|
24355|You successfully trounce the Darkwing Steward, and in doing so, dismantle the teleportation spell.|
24356|The strange energy that had been buzzing through the air slowly dissipates.|
24357|With no more spell to supply it power, the Teleport Gate blinks into inexistence.|
24358|Whew! That takes care of that.|
24359|Time to skedaddle if you don't want to run into anymore of those Darkwing Servants.|
24360|You sneak your way to the exit and manage to avoid detection.|
24361|Now, get back to the base and report the good news to Squad Leader Mildew!|
24362|You follow the signs along the path.|
24363|You feel the Power of Gaia flowing through your veins react to the spell. It's warm at first, then seems to swell and pulsate, breaking you free from the Winged Duke's control.|
24364|"Well done! No doubt, this power will prove useful in your coming battle. Liven things up a bit, you know."|
24365|Quite suddenly, the Winged Duke reappears before you, limbs in a flurry as he peppers you with blows.|
24366|You feel yourself weaken, body succumbing to the onslaught.|
24367|Everything has returned to normal, at last, and Alex is now free from the spell.|
24368|The Winged Duked might have escaped, but at least his plans were kept from coming to fruition.|
24369|You decide to head on back to the base and begin discussing your next course of action.|
24370|Reports indicate the Cube of Gaia is buried somewhere on Silent Mountain. This is a huge development!|
24371|You, too, wonder just what significance this bit of information could hold as you make your way back to camp.|
24372|You should find Victoria and run through the current situation.|
24373|You hold the rune aloft, and its imprisoning enchantments render the steward unable to move. His face contorts in rage.|
24374|How dare you stand in my way? You'll pay for this!|
24375|The Darkwing Steward seems pressed. Take him out!|
24376|Andre and his squad have set up a temporary stronghold within the cave.|
24377|They're now engaged in battle with an immortal creature most foul.|
24378|An icy storm blocks the path ahead of you. You'll have to find another way around.|
24379|Von: "Fascinating! A little rat has made its way through the maze. Woe, woe, woe is me."|
24380|Andre: "Quit your yammering and just give up already, Von! We've got you surrounded!"|
24381|The eerie chill in the air tickles the hair on the back of your neck. Those giant, icy sculptures are giving you the creeps!|
24382|Von: "Not bad, human. Yes, yes, I'd be glad to entertain you..."|
24383|Andre: "The spear of justice shall impale all who stand in its way!"|
24384|The Shadow Knight clenches his hand around his Crimson Magic Square, and a fierce, sanguine light bursts from its edges. A nearby soldier lets out a tiny squawk before collapsing to the ground. You see faint tendrils of energy spiral away from his body.|
24385|All of a sudden, the particles in the air seem to freeze. Even your very breath has turned to ice just past your lips. Some kind of malevolent power has disrupted time and space.|
24386|Andre: "Out of my way! No one leaves here alive!"|
24387|Andre: "This... this power! The ritual! It's begun!"|
24388|Andre: "I'll not allow the powers of evil to prevail!"|
24389|Von breathes in deeply, the air around you whistling and howling as he attempts to transform himself once more.|
24390|You glance around. Security looks tight. Dark Skeletal Hounds patrol the four corners of the area.|
24391|The Undead Warriors seem weaker here than in the west, making it an ideal spot for an attack. |
24392|Head back and fill Odum in on the results of your surveillance.|
24393|These are the outskirts of the Undead Legion Camp. The attack should originate here.|
24394|Defeat the Undead Warriors to create chaos!|
24395|Watch out!!|
24396|Victoria and Maggie arrive.|
24397|I will await your arrival with bated breath... if you survive, that is!|
24398|The guard seems to be distracted. He hasn't noticed your smoke bomb.|
24399|Each and every one of those vile boars is now sleeping like a baby. Mission accomplished.|
24400|Von: "You troublesome peons! Behold the power of a true dragon!"|
24401|Von absorbs the ice particles hanging in the air and mutates into an enormous dragon of ice.|
24402|The Shadow Knight begins casting a spell to repair the surrounding Crimson Magic Squares.|
24403|It gives a little sniff, ponders the smell for a moment, then falls asleep with a clunk.|
24404|The portal is finally destroyed.|
24405|Snow Mountain was successfully scouted!|
24406|The monsters! THE MONSTERS!|
24407|Quickly, follow me!|
24408|Andre leaves for the far reaches of Frozenlea in search of the Shadow Knight.|
24409|Andre can only gape in horror as the resurrection ritual begins right before his very eyes.|
24410|Once you enter the cave, the temperature plummets.|
24411|With each step, the depths of the Frozenlea Plains grow unbearably colder.|
24412|With a brilliant flash, Von transforms himself into a block of ice and disappears.|
24413|Could this battle spell the end of everything as we know it?|
24414|The Shadow Knight! He was behind everything all along... What kind of dastardly plan does he have up that infernal sleeve of his?|
24415|Guzigla focuses his energy in order to summon his Abyssal Instrument.|
24416|Odum interrupts the fighting to inquire about your condition. |
24417|The Shadow Knight destroys the Crimson Magic Square, ravaging the lands of the Frozenlea Plains, before disappearing.|
24418|Don't leave yet! Wait to make sure the boars fall asleep. |
24419|A beam of rich, golden light streaks across the sky, and the treasure appears before you.|
24420|Kusanagi: "Now, now, now! Not so fast!"|
24421|Kusanagi suddenly emerges from the light with a brilliant, rainbow flash.|
24422|Kusanagi: "Let's not take what isn't ours!"|
24423|Kusanagi: "Or do I need to teach you the hard way?!"|
24424|You notice a treasure chest where the Shadow Knight had been standing...|
24425|Use Restoration Tool Kit to restore ancient ruins.|
24426|You scooped up a goldfish! Try to get another!|
24427|The paper net broke... you'll have to wait until tomorrow to try again.|
24428|Stealthily, you write the question on the board while the Assistant Referee isn't watching. |
24429|The surroundings are eerily familiar, almost exactly as they were in your dreams. You feel a growing sense of dread.|
24430|You were victorious in your dreams, and you're certain you can do it again.|
24431|Something doesn't feel quite right, and you recollect that there was a second commander.|
24432|Jasitra Demontongue appears, just as he did in your dreams.|
24433|You force yourself to stay focused, despite the mounting unease.|
24434|You're well aware that the enemy before you might not be the true Shadow Knight.|
24435|You're left with no choice; you must fight to the bitter end.|
24436|The Shadow Knight transforms into a black flame before your eyes, then vanishes.|
24437|You remain composed, ready for anything.|
24438|Just as in your dreams, a tremendous surge of power begins to suffocate you.|
24439|You feel a familiar sense of pain and desperation. |
24440|After everything that has happened, will the Shadow Knight triumph?|
24441|You refuse to give up, but consciousness is slipping away...|
24442|"It's not over... Open your eyes."|
24443|You hear a gentle voice, and the pain begins to dissipate.|
24444|Your eyes slowly open, and you search for the source of the voice.|
24445|The world is shrouded in a funereal gray.|
24446|A familiar girl appears before you.|
24447|It is the girl from your dreams, and she's trying to speak to you.|
24448|Everything goes dark as consciousness ebbs away, but a power begins to slowly enter your body.|
24449|"Please, you must defeat him..."|
24450|Luciana's soft plea echoes in your ears.|
24451|The Templars have been defeated, and now the Grand Bishop faces the Shadow Knight. |
24452|You watch, helpless, as the Grand Bishop confronts the Shadow Knight alone.|
24453|The potion emits a dazzling glow that lights up the entire room.|
24454|Your strength is slowly returning, and you're able to move your arms and legs.|
24455|Once fully recovered, you rush toward the Grand Bishop.|
24456|A mysterious power engulfs your body, allowing you to block the deadly blow.|
24457|You stare down the Shadow Knight, ready to destroy him.|
24458|After the Shadow Knight speaks, a Magic Circle appears around you.|
24459|Your surroundings begin to twist and crumble, and a cryptic power wrenches you away.|
24460|The Shadow Knight has exiled you to another place.|
24461|There, he can face you alone in a duel to the death.|
24462|You are all alone, the formidable power of the rift swirling around you.|
24463|The Shadow Knight has opened the pathway to Pandemonium. You must stop him!|
24464|It all comes down to this battle. Everything is at stake.|
24465|Defeat the Shadow Knight once and for all!|
24466|"My dear husband, I have always been by your side."|
24467|A gentle voice speaks, suffused with love and warmth.|
24468|Luciana spreads her wings and advances toward the Shadow Knight.|
24469|Luciana turns to you, offering an appreciative bow.|
24470|She approaches the Shadow Knight, and a powerful Magic Circle appears beneath her feet.|
24471|As the Magic Circle vanishes, Luciana and the Shadow Knight disappear.|
24472|The rift radiates with ominous power, hinting at a sinister presence within.|
24473|Standing before the rift, the Grand Bishop begins to cast a spell.|
24474|A vast Magic Circle appears, encompassing the rift.|
24475|For a moment, a benevolent magic suspends the rift's dark power.|
24476|The Grand Bishop wants to speak with you. Go and talk to him.|
24477|The cave is freezing and emanates an ominous power.|
24478|In the depths of the Frozenlea Plains, someone gathers energy to open a portal.|
24479|A rare, potent evil surrounds this person.|
24480|The Frozen Sorcerer drains power from the three Dragon Tyrants.|
24481|Once the Frozen Sorcerer has absorbed all the remaining power, a sinister glow materializes.|
24482|A vast portal opens at his command.|
24483|Frozenlea is instantly engulfed in the nefarious power of Pandemonium.|
24484|The portal opens and a voice, cold as ice, resonates from the depths of Pandemonium.|
24485|"The Shadow Knight has been defeated. You must open a gate to the underworld."|
24486|"A large garrison requires a stable passageway to Terra."|
24487|Magic fire spews from the Shadow Knight's sword, annihilating everything in the hall.|
24488|A human commander orders the garrison to halt at an abandoned village.|
24489|The soldiers move to their assigned positions.|
24490|Ashe and Shirley leave the base, each with a respective squad.|
24491|Everyone pitches in to build a stronghold capable of withstanding the demons.|
24492|The image fades to reveal the emerging stronghold.|
24493|The Mirror Orb glows softly, slowly revealing an image of Asda inspecting the stronghold.|
24494|After much hard work, the stronghold is complete.|
24495|Squads move out in each direction.|
24496|Ashe's allies carry him back to the stronghold so that he can recover.|
24497|Ashe survived the emergency procedure, but he will be in a coma for several days.|
24498|As Igar finishes speaking, Ashe struggles to recall something.|
24499|Ashe and Igar are arguing when Asda appears.|
24500|Ashe is recovering quickly, and soon he will be discharged.|
24501|Despite his countless pleas, the order will not be rescinded.  |
24502|Ashe is frightened, initially mistaking the unfamiliar voice for Asda's.|
24503|The pair arrive at the stronghold to find a robot standing in the middle of the field.|
24504|Russell departs, leaving Ashe alone with the robot.|
24505|Ashe and the robot are talking, when suddenly shouts rise up all around them: demons are invading!|
24506|The image fades, slowly revealing the open battlefield.|
24507|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing an image of Ashe killing the demons.|
24508|Ashe doesn't reply, but smiles bitterly at Asda.|
24509|Shirley awakens from a nightmare, drenched in cold sweat.|
24510|She hears someone approaching and feigns sleep.|
24511|Astonished by the news, Shirley cries out.|
24512|The kidnapper charges at Shirley, and she tries desperately to flee.|
24513|The two kidnappers smile viciously as they approach Shirley.|
24514|Unable to wriggle free, Shirley has no choice but to drink the potion.|
24515|Shirley's body distorts, seized by a bone-wrenching pain.|
24516|Shirley morphs into a demon, her icy eyes trained on the kidnappers.|
24517|Abruptly, Shirley attacks the kidnappers.|
24518|The image fades, slowly revealing Shirley as a demon.|
24519|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing a glimpse of Shirley covered in blood.|
24520|Surveying the corpses at her feet, Shirley composes herself. Though her eyes are filled with tears, she can't help but smile.|
24521|"Come... come here... this is where you belong..."|
24522|"Come..."|
24523|Shirley, utterly entranced, moves toward the voice...|
24524|Ashe destroys another squad of demons and rides the Thousand Nights back to the stronghold.|
24525|Suddenly, Ashe collapses. Anthony rushes him to the medical center.|
24526|Half awake, Ashe struggles to hear an argument between Asda and someone else.|
24527|The two argue beside the bed, unaware that Ashe is awake.|
24528|Though he hasn't yet recovered, Ashe tries to reach the Thousand Nights.|
24529|He walks through a battlefield strewn with corpses.|
24530|The image fades, revealing a battlefield in the midst of war.|
24531|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing an image of the Thousand Nights battling demons.|
24532|Just as Ashe readies a final, fatal blow, the demon speaks...|
24533|Ashe hesitates, and Shirley breaks free.|
24534|Ashe scrambles after her.|
24535|Shirley stumbles, allowing Ashe to catch up with her.|
24536|They stop in the exact spot where Shirley was kidnapped.|
24537|Ashe doesn't hear Shirley clearly.|
24538|The image fades, revealing the robot and the demon.|
24539|The Mirror Orb glows softly, revealing an image of Ashe desperately defending himself.|
24540|Though Ashe fights valiantly, he is eventually defeated.|
24541|Ashe is unfazed by a heavy blow, stopping at nothing to protect Shirley.|
24542|A full-scale brawl seems inevitable, but no one has picked up a weapon yet.|
24543|Eventually everyone takes up weapons and joins the fray.|
24544|The two smile at each other.|
24545|The opposition launches an attack.|
24546|Enter Level 20 of the Infernal Abyss and use the Energy Storage Light Orb to gather Infernal War Breath. |
24547|This is Level 20 of the Infernal Abyss. Use the Energy Storage Light Orb to gather Infernal War Breath. |
24548|In Level 15, defeat Nazrudin's Nightmare and gather Whirlpool War Breath.|
24549|Use the portal to meet Imma at the Church to discuss the holy sword.|
24550|Infernal Abyss Entrance|
24551|Whirlpool Abyss Entrance|
24552|"The bothersome peons of the human world..."|
24553|"I don't understand... is such caution necessary?"|
24554|"Forget it... since you're all here, let's take a look at you."|
24555|"Are you ready for the chaos of Pandemonium?"|
24556|"Very interesting indeed..."|
24557|"Treasure what little you have, humans."|
24558|"We shall meet again soon."|
24559|Lavalord: The bothersome peons of the human world...|
24560|Lavalord: I don't understand... is such caution necessary?|
24561|Lavalord: Forget it... since you're all here, let's take a look at you.|
24562|Lavalord: Are you ready for the chaos of Pandemonium?|
24563|Lavalord: Very interesting indeed...|
24564|Lavalord: Treasure what little you have, humans.|
24565|Lavalord: We shall meet again soon.|
24566|Shirley is injured, and Ashe pursues her on the Thousand Nights.|
24567|Upon entering the cave, you feel a burning sensation tingle across your skin.|
24568|The lost adventurer should be inside - go find him.|
24569|Suddenly a flame giant appears, blocking the path.|
24570|Defeat the giant, then continue your search for the adventurer.|
24571|Pillars of flame shoot from the ground, and the cave begins to shake violently.|
24572|In the depths of the cave, it is unbearably hot.|
24573|You are afflicted with the "Burning Flame" effect. Avoid party members with thunder and lightning effects to avoid setting off a Lightning Explosion.|
24574|You are afflicted with the "Ultra Shock" effect. Avoid party members with flame effects to avoid setting off a Lightning Explosion.|
24575|Who knows what Soreth is planning? More important is finding the adventurer inside the cave.|
24576|Flames swirl across the ground, blocking the gate to the depths.|
24577|Hwaaah! This monster has become a raving lunatic! Quick, someone save me before this thing notices me!|
24578|After defeating Hugh, you can't be sure if the adventurer is safe. Find him quickly!|
24579|The depths are somehow even hotter, perhaps because Soreth has just appeared.|
24580|Ghostweep Fairies are gathering, but their intentions are unclear...|
24581|The Ghostweep Fairies are burning their own flame power to summon the Flame Element King.|
24582|A treasure chest appears in the wake of Soreth's defeat.|
24583|The poison marsh has spread to the path. The sluice gate is blocking the way. Eliminate the ant warriors attacking the water purifier, then start it up again.|
24584|After defeating the Flame Element King, you hear noises from deep below: the adventurer's distant cries, along with the fierce roar of monsters.|
24585|You take massive damage from Lightning Explosion because you were afflicted with the "Burning Flame" and "Ultamite Thunder" effects.|
24586|The Fire Watchdogs are attacking, and their victim looks a whole lot like the adventurer. |
24587|The watchdogs have activated the Beastmaster's Blood! Things couldn't get much worse. Quick, save the adventurer!|
24588|Defeat the Fire Watchdogs and save the adventurer to complete this task.|
24589|Soreth: "You show some pretty good moves. We should spar together; you may be good enough to kill time with."|
24590|Soreth: "I see you've grown a backbone! Well then, come on in."|
24591|Soreth waits inside, and the adventurer is safe for the time being.|
24592|Soreth's plan is anyone's guess. Go inside and save him!|
24593|Suddenly a blazing firestorm appears.|
24594|The priests have performed a mysterious ceremony to summon fallen lunatics.|
24595|At that moment, an earthquake shook the area. It's an ominous portent...|
24596|Gandam IV has absorbed the poison marsh from inside the room and converted it into a buff.|
24597|Fatima has re-condensed a large quantity of mana and removed the recharging status.|
24598|The ceremony is complete. The room is now charged with intense electrical energy. Fatima is waiting patiently for you in the middle of the room.|
24599|Fatima has condensed a large quantity of mana to cast Ultra Shock Bombardment. In the magic circle, you can help apportion the caster's damage.|
24600||
24601||
24602|Soreth gathers flame power as the raging fire engulfs him.|
24603|The more power Soreth accumulates, the faster he heals.|
24604|A tremendous bolt of lightning interrupts the process, and an unfamiliar female voice begins to speak.|
24605|???: "Soreth, at long last I've found you." |
24606||
24607|???: "I didn't want it to come to this, but the general is looking for you. Or perhaps you'd rather I share your little secret?"|
24608|Vital Strike is ready to release, causing powerful damage.|
24609|Vital Strike is ready to release, causing serious damage.|
24610|Vital Strike is ready to release, causing devastating damage.|
24611|???: "When the time is right, the general will destroy you all, Envoys of Gaia." |
24612|The voice fades, and Soreth disappears.|
24613|The passage ahead has been blocked by fire. The path is impassable.|
24614|Ashe rises after the two have left.|
24615|At that moment, Ashe senses someone else nearby.|
24616|Watch out, everyone! Demons are attacking!|
24617|The message in the orb stops.|
24618|Though he can't identify them, Ashe follows in the hopes of finding Shirley.|
24619|The restless clangs and shuffles of the pursuing kidnappers can be heard behind Shirley.|
24620|The Mirror Orb floats quietly through the empty hall.|
24621|Sensing people nearby, the Mirror Orb begins to glow.|
24622|You leave the Logging Site and return the robot to the base.|
24623|Welcome, Envoys of Gaia, to the City of Navea! Today we celebrate the founding of our great city.|
24624|The city has organized a carnival with spectacular floats. It's starting now!|
24625|First, we have Endora's float. This is truly a lovely group.|
24626|Can you believe how adorable they are? Please, folks, give them a round of applause.|
24627|Next up, it's the Goddess of Victory. She's absolutely stunning.|
24628|Next is the kind-hearted Kotonoha, along with the cheeky Gemini siblings.|
24629|Kotonoha is truly gracious: look how she waves to everyone in the crowd.|
24630|Finally, we have Alucard and his handsome cohorts.|
24631|They're not bad on the eyes, that's for sure. Marina even saw a few girls faint when they went past!|
24632|The city is also putting on a marvelous fireworks show, which has attracted spectators from near and far.|
24633|The fireworks are taking place in front the military hall, where the soldiers are watching with delight.|
24634|Another dazzling fireworks display at a residential junction has attracted nearby residents.|
24635|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the east. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24636|Rasal: Second battalion, attack! Kick 'em while they're down!|
24637|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the south. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24638|Rasal: Well, well. We'll see how long you can keep this up. The third battalion is ready for attack!|
24639|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the west. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24640|Rasal: This is getting ridiculous. Charge from the north and surround them!|
24641|The Varan Bandits are launching an attack from the north. Protect the Ruins Fragment!|
24642|Rasal: Curses! What is this nonsense? Towerbreakers, charge and attack the main tower!|
24643|Towerbreakers are attacking the cube tower from all four sides. Stop them!|
24644|Rasal: You despicable fools. Now I'll show you true power!|
24645|The four cubes react simultaneously, emitting a mysterious energy.|
24646|The Focus Towers are in the final stage of gathering power from the Ruins. Don't let the Varan Bandits interrupt the process!|
24647|Be ready for Rasal's attacks. The Focus Towers must finish charging.|
24648|The powerful energy destroys the Varan Bandits. Rasal is the only one left standing.|
24649|The energy released by the cube destroys all of the Varan Bandits.|
24650|This year's carnival has come to an end. Thank you, everybody, for being part of the celebration. See you next year!|
24651|The Green Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24652|The Red Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24653|The Purple Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24654|The Yellow Ruins Fragment is damaged. It will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Protect it.|
24655|The cube fragments are damaged and unable to resonate. Ensure that all four cubes are working.|
24656|The Focus Towers are destroyed. They will automatically regenerate after five seconds. Fortify the tower defenses.|
24657|Rasal is on the brink of death. Time to strike the final, fatal blow!|
24658|The Focus Towers emit an eerie beam of light.|
24659|Because the village is so close to the demon army, Asda has decided to investigate the surrounding area.|
24660|Lang and Natalie await you at the front. Go ask Lang about the situation.|
24661|Rasal: Well! It seems as though the ruins are about to be restored yet again!|
24662|Rasal: And, as always, the Varan Bandits will get their way!|
24663|Rasal: Assault team, commence the onslaught! Tear everything to the ground!|
24664|And that is that. Hop through the portal and see Charters for the reward.|
24665|The energy released by the Ruins Fragment can be used to stop the Varan Bandits by using the nearby cubes.|
24666|Repairing the relic box will turn the Green Ruins into a Relic Box full of wind energy.|
24667|Repairing the relic box will turn the Red Ruins into a Relic Box full of fire energy.|
24668|Repairing the relic box will turn the Purple Ruins into a Relic Box full of dark energy.|
24669|Debris from the ruins shimmers with a mysterious light.|
24670|Repairing the relic box will turn the Yellow Ruins into a Relic Box full of light energy.|
24671|The city of Navea is always prosperous as it's a popular spot for residents and travelers who want to partake in everything the city has to offer.|
24672|Suddenly, a noise erupts from the Military Zone. A crowd of people starts to gather in the area.|
24673|There must be something going on! Quick, go check it out!|
24674|"To all Envoys of Gaia, the citizens of the holy city and travelers..."|
24675|"Good day to all of you! I am MARINA, the host of this carnival!!!"|
24676|"I'm GIGAS, the strongest Eidolon-slash-assistant."|
24677|"Dear people, do you what's happening here today?"|
24678|"That's right! It's the annual anniversary of the founding day of the city of Navea!"|
24679|"The fantastic float parade is coming up next!"|
24680|"Music unites everyone!" "Come on! Cheer for your princess!" "It's time to dance!"|
24681|"Wee! It seems that even our floats are ready to party!"|
24682|"Well then, let us first welcome the cute dance troop led by Endora!"|
24683|"Apart from our very own Eidolon, brave little ones from the Grass Kingdom are also participating in the performance!"|
24684|"Next in arriving is the castle-themed float led by Astraea!"|
24685|"Look at these cute little tanuki. There truly is a palpable sense of joy and celebration in the holy city!"|
24686|"Here comes: Kotonoha, and Hansel and Gretel!"|
24687|"Oh look, a dessert float! Doesn't it look delicious? Even Marina can't resist the temptation to take a bite!"|
24688|"Aaaand finally! The highlight of the show... here come the male gods lead by Demir the Dragon Tyrant!"|
24689|"Even with their busy schedules..."|
24690|"They still take the time off just to participate on this important day. Let's cheer for them!"|
24691|"Come on, everybody! I can't heaaaar yooooou! Get loud!"|
24692|"The parade is moving to the north of the central square. Head on over there! There is much more to see!"|
24693|"The vendors at the stalls will only come out when they see a float, so don't miss out!"|
24694|Marina and Gigas are walking towards the northwest of the central square, and they look as if they are announcing something.|
24695|"Everyone, this is Marina speaking. Time sure does fly by when you're having fun. Sadly, we have come to the end of the parade."|
24696|"The parade will make its way to the northwest corner of the central square for one final goodbye."|
24697|"For those who haven't been able to catch all of the floats, take this opportunity to do so!"|
24698|You can feel the joy of the anniversary celebration spreading across the holy city.|
24699|At this moment, Marina speaks again.|
24700|"Everyone, this is Marina speaking. I regret to announce that the event has come to an end."|
24701|"But there's no need to despair. We will hold this event every day, at the same time, for a certain period of time."|
24702|"With that said, we thank you all, and we shall see you the next time."|
24703|Marina: To all Envoys of Gaia, the citizens of the holy city and travelers...|
24704|Marina: I bid you all good day! I am Marina, the host of this carnival!!!|
24705|Gigas: I am Gi-gas, the strongest Eidolon and assistant.|
24706|Marina: Can anyone guess what's happening here today?|
24707|Gigas: That's right! It's the annual anniversary of the founding day of the city of Navea!|
24708|Marina: Coming up is the spectacular parade!|
24709|???: Music unites everyone!|
24710|???: Come on! Cheer for your princess!|
24711|???: Let's dance!|
24712|Marina: What? It seems that even our floats are ready to party!|
24713|Marina: Well then, let us first welcome the cute dance troupe led by Endora!|

24718|Marina: They showed up in a dessert float! Doesn't it look delicious? Even Marina can't resist the temptation to take a bite!"|
24719|Marina: Last lesson! The highlight of the show... here come the male gods lead by Alucard the Dragon Tyrant!"|
24720|Gigas: Even with their busy schedules...|
24721|Marina: They still take the time off just to participate on this important day. Let's give them all three cheers!|
24722|Gigas: "Come on, everybody! I can't heaaaar yooooou! Get loud!"|
24723|Marina: The parade is moving to the north of the central square. Let's go over there and we can check out the stalls.|
24724|Gigas: The vendors at the stalls will only come out when they see a float, so don't miss out!|
24725|Marina: Everyone, this is Marina speaking. Time sure does fly by when you're having fun. Sadly, we've come to the end of the parade.|
24726|Marina: The parade will make its way to the northwest corner of the central square for one final goodbye.|

24729|Gigas: We will hold this event every day, at the same time, for a certain period of time.|
24730|Marina: With that, we would like to thank all of you and we shall see you next time.|
24731|The parade is moving to the north of the central square. Let's go over there and we can check out the stalls.|
24732|The vendors at the stalls will only come out when they see a float, so don't miss out!|
24733|Everyone, this is Marina speaking. Time sure does fly by when you're having fun. Sadly, we've come to the end of the parade.|
24734|The parade will make its way to the northwest corner of the central square for one final goodbye.|
24735|For those who haven't been able to catch all of the floats, take this opportunity to do so!|
24736|Use the Light Ruins skill to repair heavily damaged Focus Towers.|
24737|Use the Light Ruins skill to repair heavily damaged Focus Towers.|
24738|Marina has reached the holy city! Defeat her for a chance to obtain her Duel Card!|
24739|There's someone ahead calling for help. Go and check what's going on.|
24740|The archaeologists seem to be running off in fright.|
24741|Quickly go inside and kill the monsters.|
24742|The way ahead has been blocked by the hurricane. Looks like you'll have to find another way.|
24743|The air current here seems different, and suddenly a hurricane forms.|
24744|???: Roar!|
24745|A giant beast is suddenly standing there, looking very angry.|
24746|Looks like the hurricane blockade was caused by this monster.|
24747|The beast needs to be removed if you want to proceed.|
24748|The hurricane dies down as the beast is killed. Keep going.|
24749|This giant rock has blocked the path ahead. Find a way to break it.|
24750|Suddenly the earth shakes. It appears that something is moving beneath the ground.|
24751|A Giant Stone Golem emerges from the ground. It looks to be the one that's is guarding the entrance.|
24752|The giant rock must have been created by the Stone Golem using magic, as it disappears after the death of the Golem.|
24753|There's a Magic Circle ahead, filled with evil dark power.|
24754|???: Who's this... How dare you interrupt my nap.|
24755|An angry voice can be heard from the ground as dark air grows heavier and stronger.|
24756|The roar of an angry beast can be heard deep inside.|
24757|Looks like there are some other monsters hiding.|
24758|Stop the monsters from ever hurting people again. Go inside and kill them.|
24759|There seems to be a deadly wind blowing in this area.|
24760|A huge magic circle suddenly appears in the sky, and it is sucking in all the energy.|
24761|Looks like the roar heard just now is from this giant beast.|
24762|Destroy it, and everything will be back to normal.|
24763|The magic circle is getting stronger. It may mean that a more powerful creature will soon wake up.|
24764|The magic circle emits a sudden beam of light, and a great beast descends.|
24765|The giant beast is so badly injured that it cannot move. Go and deal the fatal strike.|
24766|A huge black magic circle is forms on the ground, covering the beast|
24767|The beast then disappears instantly within the magic circle. Looks like someone teleported it away.|
24768|???: "Outrageous! Who dares to bully my little girl!!!"|
24769|An unfamiliar girl's voice suddenly rings out.|
24770|???: "I can't believe you! I'm going to make you pay for that!"|
24771|Bolts of lightning suddenly strike, but do not hit any of the Envoys of Gaia...|
24772|???: "You actually avoided that?!"|
24773|???: "Hmm! Just despicable... I will never forget that!"|
24774|???: "You're not going to be that lucky the next time!"|
24775|The angry voice fades, and everything is back to normal.|
24776|After defeating the Manticore, a treasure chest appears...|
24777|You call out Phoebe's name as you look everywhere for her.|
24778|Not much movement here... better check the other exit.|
24779|Hearing your call, a little girl runs out from a corner.|
24780|You've found Phoebe. Quickly bring her back to Mayor Rufus!|
24781|Is father looking for me? We must go back as soon as possible. It not, father's gonna be angry again...|
24782|You smell a strong, horrid stench up ahead. Must be the mutated deep sea fish.|
24783|You carefully extra the rotten fish's stomach, and put it into the cloth bag.|
24784|Quickly, leave and take the cloth bag back to Penny.|
24785|A beam of light shoots out just as a translucent Magic Barrier appears.|
24786|The Magic Barrier disappears instantly, but its lingering protection helps keep people safe.|
24787|The defensive measures have been established. Quickly go back and tell Alan.|
24788|A ball of black mist has been sucked into the Cleansing Orb, and the discomforting atmosphere instantly clears up.|
24789|The closer you are to the interior, the higher the chance that the air will make you sick.|
24790|After taking the matter into consideration, you assign Phoebe to take charge of the troops, and then head back to Mortonville alone.|
24791|Secret Blade Settlement Hideout|
24792|You pour the reagent into the water, and look out for any changes on the water's surface.|
24793|Once in contact with the reagent, the water starts to produce a few red air bubbles.|
24794|Go test the other areas of the beach.|
24795|Mortonville|
24796|Spinel Shores|
24797|Abandoned Fishing Village|

24808|Krampus Altar|
24809|Take the captured sea monster to the Abandoned Fishing Village, and meet with Penny who is conduction Sarpa research.|
24810|There are some footprints on the beach. Try using these to locate the missing little girl.|
24811|Go to the Guard Squad Camp and meet with Guard Captain Norman.|
24812|Go to Verdant Woods and look for the Mage. Ask him to help you clean up the seawater pollution.|
24813|Go to the Abandoned Fishing Village and join Penny in the investigation.|
24814|You make your way to the beach to prepare with everyone else while you wait for Cecil the Mage to arrive.|
24815|Go to the Marble Ruins and look for the Mage since he never returned.|
24816|Go over to near the Blade Settlement and look for the guard who is conducting an investigation.|
24817|Go to Blade Settlement, defeat the Trainer and the Battle Wolf, and find Felion the Guard.|
24818|Ask the residents for details about the young wolf.|
24819|Cecil starts to cast a purification spell. You feel as if the Divine Power is in the air.|
24820|Defeat the invading sea monsters.|
24821|The first wave of sea monsters has been defeated. Prepare for the second wave.|
24822|The second wave of sea monsters has been defeated. Prepare for the third wave.|
24823|The third wave of sea monsters has been defeated. Prepare for the fourth wave.|
24824|The fourth wave of sea monsters has been defeated. Prepare to battle the boss.|
24825|The Fish King of Port Morton, the Shadow Lancer, has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
24826|The Fish King of Candetonn Hill, the Submerged Starlight, has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
24827|Looks like there are people next to the tent. The person you are looking for might be there.|
24828|Looks like they're not here. Check the last exit.|
24829|Cecil slowly walks out from one side.|
24830|Go ahead and meet with Anya.|
24831|Anya and the soldiers are ready for battle with the sea monsters.|
24832|There seem to be phantoms of the past here, so you decide to go and take a closer look.|
24833|The phantoms have stopped moving and time seems to have also stopped.|
24834|Once in contact with the reagent, the water starts to produce a few red air bubbles.|
24835|Looks like there's some serious pollution here. Quickly go back and tell Penny.|
24836|There's someone at the ruins up ahead. Looks to be a mage.|
24837|Back at the town, spot Anya and Penny from a ways off. Looks like they are discussing something.|
24838|You notice that there are many soldiers stationed at the coast. The sea monster problem must be quite serious.|
24839|The soldiers are roaring out battle cries, trying to show their high morale. Ready for battle!|
24840|Belenus is trying to control the Holy Barrier power, while soldiers stand all around.|
24841|You've caught the Gale Claw Minerva. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24842|You've caught Cyclops Dudley. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24843|You've caught Opportunist Tamir. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24844|You've caught Sharptooth Kermit. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24845|You've caught Sharpbeak Predator Osmond. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24846|You've caught Dmitri The Scythe. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24847|You've caught Stealth Poisoner Houston. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24848|You've caught Unholy Fang Fidel. Go pick up the egg and give it to Preddle the Guard!|
24849|You feel something strange in the beach air that puts you on edge. You decide to be more cautious.|
24850|You feel something strange in the air, so you decide to take special care while exploring.|
24851|The Bird Hatchling, which is now free once again, happily flies through the woods, disappearing deep into the forest.|
24852|It seems Mefo needs some help. Go help him fight off all the Monsters.|
24853|The Ventos Prairie Card Rangers are now taking on all challengers! Interested Card Duel fighters should go and challenge them now!|
24854|Suddenly you sense a strong magic in the air...|
24855|There seems to be something strange buried in the soil.|
24856|You have dug out a box from under a big tree. This must be the one Malia was looking for.|
24857|As you enter the ruins, the thick dust coating everything inside tells you that you must be the first person to visit in quite some time.|
24858|There's a squad leader shouting from afar. Go look for Bach to find out more.|
24859|The portal leading down to the depths of the Ruins is already open. Please note that the exploration time is 20 minutes.|
24860|Gibreel's voice can be heard, in discussion with the other archaeologists up ahead.|
24861|Lalilu's voice can be heard, in discussion with the other archaeologists up ahead.|
24862|Robin's voice can be heard, in discussion with the other archaeologists up ahead.|
24863|After opening all the chests, you have discovered more treasure than Isaias.|
24864|After opening all the chests, Isaias has discovered more treasure than you.|
24865|After finishing his sentence, Isaias leaves as swiftly as the wind.|
24866|There's Gibreel shouting from the front. Seems to have found something.|
24867|There's Yulia shouting with excitement. Seems like she's found some treasure.|
24868|Grab the treasure before Isaias snatches everything!|
24869|The room seems to be full of cultural relics. Go look for Gibreel to find out more.|
24870|Cultural relics are scattered throughout this room. Go look for Lalilu to find out more.|
24871|Cultural relics are scattered throughout this room. Go look for Robin to find out more.|
24872|You touched an ancient mechanism during your excavation. Activate the first mechanism.|
24873|You touched an ancient mechanism during your excavation. Activate the second mechanism.|
24874|You touched an ancient mechanism during your excavation. Activate the third mechanism.|
24875|You tidied up all the cultural relics. The aura contained in the relics has been gathered inside the goddess statue, restoring it in the process.|
24876|This room contains many treasure chests. It seems to be some kind of storage room for these chests.|
24877|Yulia and Ebazon seem to be discussing something. You should go and check it out.|
24878|You have successfully activated all the mechanisms. A treasure chest appears.|
24879|You have successfully repaired two goddess statues. A treasure chest appears.|
24880|You open the treasure chest, and a portal leading to the level below appears.|
24881|You have come to a room. Gibreel and everyone else seem to be busy with something.|
24882|While Gibreel is activating a door-opening crystal, head over to the light spots on the dig site and see if you can dig out a few relics|
24883|While you are digging, your vision suddenly goes dark.|
24884|"Ah!" You can hear Gibreel screaming, but you don't know what is happening.|
24885|Even though your vision is impaired, you somehow realize that there are three Goblins up ahead. They seem to be holding on to something.|
24886|Help Gibreel recover the crystal key by defeating the Treasure Goblins who snatched it.|
24887|The Lavalord casts a dark and powerful spell using Glittering Stone energy, summoning a horde of monsters and engulfing the forest in flames.|
24888|Use the skills in your skill bar to attack the Treasure Goblin. The mission will be accomplished once they've been defeated.|
24889|After tidying up the cultural relics, there aren't any more materials to be found, but there are some items.|
24890|The exploration has ended for today. Please come back tomorrow.|
24891|You have successfully caught the Treasure Goblins. Take back the crystal and return it to Gibreel, then activate it.|
24892|You have found the aura that has the power to restore the goddess statue. Go to the bottom of the statue to start the restoration.|
24893|You have used some material to restore the goddess statue, but you will need more to restore it fully.|
24894|After a bit of restoration work, the goddess statue is finally back in its original form.|
24895|You have found a Sun Runestone among the cultural relics. Collect seven Runestones and hand them over to Robin to remove the seal.|
24896|You have found one Sun Runestone among the artifacts, but you still need three more. Go look for the rest.|
24897|You've found the final Sun Runestone among the artifacts. Go hand them all over to Robin to remove the seal.|
24898|Press Hotkey 1 at the place emitting light to use Excavate and search for cultural relics.|
24899|You have found one Sun Runestone among the artifacts, but you still need two more. Go look for the rest.|
24900|You have found a Sun Runestone among the artifacts, but you need one more. Go look for the rest.|
24901|You have looked through all the relics but you still cannot find the Sun Runestone. Go look at the next set.|
24902|Help tidy up the relics scattered all over the room. Look out for the special aura that can help restore the goddess statue.|
24903|Differentiate between the relics by matching the corresponding light colors. Keep an eye out for Sun Runestones among the relics as well.|
24904|You are now competing with Isaias. Open as many treasure chests as possible, until every chest is open. Try to open more chests than Isaias.|
24905|Robin places all seven Sun Runestones into the slate. The mechanism activates, and a treasure chest appears.|
24906|You have defeated the Treasure Goblins.|
24907|The portal leading to the level below is now open. Head on down!|
24908|Archaeology Instance in use.|
24909|An evil aura descends around you. Quickly, purify it to prevent Ghodroon from absorbing its energy!|
24910|Purifying the evil aura will destroy Ghodroon's armored scales.|
24911|Unable to enter, Shadow Amethyst has not yet sealed off the Shadow Vortex.|
24912|Some disciples are stationed up ahead, as well as a crystal pulsating with enormous power.|
24913|Murky, black water appears on the ground. A portent of evil! The Shadow Disciple will soon emerge. Arm yourself!|
24914|The evil shadow form of Ghodroon the Flamecaller emerges from the black water!|
24915|Ghodroon the Flamecaller awaits you in battle!|
24916|Ghodroon: You weak, pathetic runt! Show me what you're made of!|
24917|Ghodroon: In this world, only a select few can defeat me. Anyone who can join that elite group is surely worthy to receive some dragon treasure.|
24918|Ghodroon: This treasure shall be given to all of you!|
24919|The power of the Shadow Amethyst temporarily seals the Shadow Vortex in the Abyss.|
24920|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirling evil thoughts for about 1 minute.|
24921|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirl of shadow vortex for about 3 minutes.|
24922|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirl of shadow vortex for about 5 minutes.|
24923|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirl of shadow vortex for about 7 minutes.|
24924|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirl of shadow vortex for about 10 minutes.|
24925|The power of the Shadow Amethyst has now been exhausted. The Shadow Vortex will soon start anew. Quickly, escape the Abyss before the evil aura harms you!|
24926|A bell is ringing from afar.|
24927|Saint Nicolas rides the sleigh up to the Holy Tree.|
24928|He has brought along a sack full of gifts for everyone.|
24929|Nicolas: Hey, hey, be patient! No snatching. Everyone will get something.|
24930|Jim's snowman emits a gentle beam of sky-blue light.|
24931|The power of the Shadow Amethyst can only stop the Shadow Vortex a short while. Once its power is exhausted, the swirl will reopen once more.|
24932|The Hellcat seems unable to bear the pungent smell, and leaves.|
24933|Temporary Camp|
24934|Greengrass Prairie|
24935|Jade Forest|
24936|Withered Plains|
24937|Abandoned Excavation Site|
24938|Charred Forest|
24939|Plateau Hunting Village|
24940|Gorge Plateau|
24941|Gelu Village|
24942|Oland Village|
24943|Misty Tree Valley|
24944|Abandoned Dry Well|
24945|Your teammate thanks you for the invaluable help you've given while taking care of them.|
24946|You are paralysed by a powerful attack, and can no longer move.|
24947|You hear the sound of mechanisms turning underground, then everything goes quiet.|
24948|It ought to have been successful. Go report to Mia.|
24949|The Goblin hears your voice, and decides to follow you. Bring him back with you.|
24950|The powerful demon barrier is preventing you from getting any closer. You have to retreat.|
24951|You shout out to the Goblin as search to locate him.|
24952|Barton is back to normal! Freddy should hear about this! Go report the news.|
24953|I am not convinced about the underlying cause of the disaster!|
24954|After a thorough examination, you do not find anything abnormal. Go back and report to Victoria.|
24955|Are you looking for me?|
24956|Princess Eleanora suddenly pushes you away, as if sensing an imminent danger.|
24957|Looking from afar, you can see the princess trapped inside the Fire Wall, writhing in agony.|
24958|Eleanora, trapped by the Fire Wall, grows weak and collapses...|
24959|Suddenly, the earth begins to quake violently. Something must be happening!|
24960|With a huge blast of flame and a thunderous crash, a pack of monsters seem to erupt from the belly of the Earth|
24961|The monsters begin to sniff out and direct themselves towards Princess Eleanora. You must go and protect her!|
24962|You have annihilated all the nearby demons. Now go and check on the princess!|
24963|As the Lavalord descends, the smell of ash surrounds you. Plants wither in the intense heat while your skin beneath its armor begins to prickle.|
24964|You are ensnared in a tendril of flame and cannot move.|
24965|Soreth: Haha! Try and stop me, will you? You puny thing! Alright then, let's see what you've got.|
24966|Soreth: I've been thirsting for some Guardian blood.|
24967|Soreth: Once you're out of my way, I'll rule this place! Nobody can stop me! Hahahahaha!!|
24968|Your Power of Gaia has broken the Lavalord's spell!|
24969|Soreth: Just despicable... How could someone break my Flame Shield?!|
24970|Soreth: Don't get cocky, now. The Purgatory Gate awaits!|
24971|Soreth: That's all for today. Next time you won't be so lucky!|
24972|Go and check on Princess Eleanora!|
24973|Sensing your presence at her side, Princess Eleanora says gently:|
24974|Thank you for saving me...|
24975|I am protected. It seems that my necklace has absorbed some Power of Gaia.|
24976|Don't worry about me. I'll rest for a while, then I'll be fine...|
24977|The village chief is a stubborn person. You'd better try and find a way to deal with him.|
24978|As you make your way to the south, you catch a glimpse of a shadowy figure swiftly moving towards the Excavation Site. Go and catch up with him!|
24979|Lavalord: "Humph! You dare to challenge me? You're nothing but a pathetic Tree Guard!"|
24980|Everything suddenly goes black. All you can hear is the sound of Eleanora's screams as she's violently pulled away from you.|
24981|After some rest, Princess Eleanora is looking much better.|
24982|All of a sudden, a violent tremor shakes the earth. You have no time to react!|
24983|A strong wind blows, carrying with it the scent of death. Your spine tingles.|
24984|Danger seems to be all around you. Suddenly, there's an outburst of noise. It's coming from nearby!|
24985|The Lavalord raises his giant axe and strikes at the princess!|
24986|A powerful beam of protective light shoots out from the princess...|
24987|This mysterious beam of light seems to keep the princess safe...|
24988|Protect Princess Eleanora|
24989|A huge surge of power bursts forth from your body, stopping the Lavalord's flame!|
24990|The Fish King of Viridian Steppe, the Crimson Aquadevil, has appeared! Any fisherman who's up for the challenge can go and take him on!|
24991|The Fish King of the Desolate Valley, Khaz Walid, has appeared! Any fisherman who's up for the challenge can go and take him on!|
24992|The Aura Pollen in your hand faintly glimmers.|
24993|The Aura Pollen floats up into the cloud of Pestilent Air. Its glow seems to strengthen in intensity.|
24994|The Pestilent Air dissipates as the Aura Pollen purifies it, revealing the Mesmerizing Flower hidden within.|
24995|All the Pestilent Air nearby has already been dissipated, so the Aura Pollen has no effect.|
24996|The Mesmerizing Flowers are blooming once again in the field, lending the whole meadow a pinkish hue.|
24997|The Shadow Amethyst has run out of power. With nothing to block them, the Shadow Vortex open up once more.|
24998|The Shadow Amethyst has regained some power. As it activates, the Shadow Vortex close once more.|
24999|Ghodroon: Interesting! Now I'll use my Phantom Clones to deal with you.|
25000|Ghodroon uses his energy to create Phantom Clones to fight you.|
25001|Ghodroon: Not bad, not bad. You've shown some decent ability there. This treasure shall be my little reward for all of you.|
25002|Ghodroon: If you wish to get more treasure, you'll have to battle again. Haha... hahahahaha!!|
25003|Ghodroon: Beating my clones isn't easy, so you may have some treasure as a reward!|
25004|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirling evil thoughts for about 15 seconds.|
25005|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirling evil thoughts for about 20 seconds.|
25006|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirling evil thoughts for about 30 seconds.|
25007|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirling evil thoughts for about 40 seconds.|
25008|The Shadow Amethyst draws away some power from the disciple. This power can seal the swirling evil thoughts for about 50 seconds.|
25009|Waldo has agreed to try to persuade the Village Chief. Go look for the chief so you can discuss the matter.|
25010|Solve Jayden's problem|
25011|"Ah! The seal has finally weakened! Curse you, Firecrackerman!"|
25012|"I'm going to smash you and everyone else in this world!"|
25013|Loud crashes and bangs can be heard from inside. It seems like there's a monster trying to break some sort of seal!|
25014|Firecrackerman: "By thunder and flame! I can't keep the Magic Barrier up any longer... I've used up all my power."|
25015|Firecrackerman: "Envoys of Gaia, go to the Magic Barrier Seal and stop Primal Nian! You must go quickly!"|
25016|"Ahem. Boys, let's go back and prepare the feast first!"|
25017|Firecrackerman: "Thanks everyone for your help. We shall be seeing each other again soon!"|
25018|As soon as he's finished thanking everyone, Firecrackerman disappears with a puff of gunpowder smoke. He really is a true gent.|
25019|A loud noise draws your attention to the burrow¡X a giant monster has climbed to the surface!|
25020|Calen: Grrr... it's a tight fit! Did someone shrink this hole while I wasn't looking?|
25021|Calen: What's this? Easter eggs? They're mine! Who dares stand between me and that yolky goodness?|
25022|Calen: Oh, it's you!|
25023|Calen: Hahaha! As if a puny, hairless freak like you could keep me from my eggy-weggs!|
25024|Calen: Was that an attack? I thought you were trying to give me a massage!|
25025|Calen: Oof! Maybe I can't stomach this, after all... Looks like you get off with a warning this time!|
25026|Calen: It's not me, right? This hole is definitely getting smaller...|
25027|The Eclipse Rabbit King turns tail and bounds back to his burrow! What a sore loser!|
25028|Calen: You didn't beat me! I just had a tummy ache!|
25029|The Eclipse Rabbit King turns tail and bounds back to his burrow! What a sore loser!|
25030|The Easter Egg Detector vibrates forcefully. There might be Easter eggs nearby! You decide to take a closer look.|
25031|A rabbit is waving at you frantically. The situation is urgent! Go check it out!|
25032|The Eclipse Rabbit Army storms in from behind!|
25033|The frontier? Uh, I'll leave that to you, I'll stay here back to keep an eye on things! Now come! Easter Bunnies!|
25034|You nod in agreement and begin to gear yourself up for battle. Leave the rear cover to Bebe!|
25035|Use the Astral Hammer to defeat the Eclipse Rabbit!|
25036|The Easter Bunny and his bunny brethren hop over from the back. Looks like the danger has been averted for the time being.|
25037|The way forward is being blocked by the Electromagnetic Net set by Talaba.|
25038|Talaba is stepping over the Shashek Warriors' corpses with disdain.|
25039|Tabala sees you, and thinking you are a Shashek soldier, looks at you with a look of pure hate and aggression. He roars fiercely at the sky.|
25040|With Talaba's death, the Electromagnetic Net has lost its power.|
25041|There's an Electromagnetic Net here too. First we need to take out the intruders controlling it.|
25042|Utad is enraged at seeing you, and yells at Talaba furiously.|
25043|With Utad's death, the Electromagnetic Net has lost its power.|
25044|Scott screams his lungs out, to alert his boss.|
25045|Kra-Booooooom!|
25046|The whole Temple starts shaking, and you feel a strong quaking force throbbing from its depths.|
25047|Go and investigate.|
25048|Hedia's energy swirl flashes about dramatically.|
25049|You suddenly sense a strong force seeping into Hedia's body.|
25050|Hedia recovers health and starts to fight with renewed vigor.|
25051|He uses some sort of magic, and suddenly your body is frozen.|
25052|Hedia teleports himself to safety. Your body is mobile again.|
25053|Now that Hedia has consumed the power of the Temple, you realize he will be even harder to defeat the next time you meet.|
25054|You'll have to strengthen yourself before facing him!|
25055|Easter Egg Detector: Beep Beep Beep! Looks like there may be something nearby...|
25056|Stop! Stay right there. Not one step forward!|
25057|The Easter Egg Detector starts vibrating vigorously. It's giving off a strong signal! It seems to be reacting to something magical in the vicinity.|
25058|Eclipse Rabbit Vanguard: Ouch! That wasn't very nice!|
25059|Did you really just hit the Easter Bunny? Seeing the Easter Bunny's tears shocks you and makes you feel a little guilty.|
25060|Scott has sealed the portal to the Temple with the Seal of Thunder.|
25061|With the defeat of Scott, the seal has also been removed.|
25062|After Fatima left, a treasure chest appeared.|
25063|The way ahead is blocked by a Magic Seal, you need to find another way.|
25064|You try to relieve the awkwardness with a banana and ask the Bigear Primate about the difficulties he faced on his travels.|
25065|You try to improve your relationship with a gift and ask the Bigear Primate about the difficulties on his travels.|
25066|You show off your ballet moves in an attempt to attract the Bigear Primate's interest and ask about the difficulties on his travels.|
25067|The local Bigear Primate is annoyed with you and shoos you out with a curse.|
25068|The local Bigear Primate is touched by your sincerity and has decided to accept your request. Negotiation complete.|
25069|Squeak squeak squeak squeak!|
25070|Seems like the Succubus is casting a spell. You can see the Ice Wall strengthening as she works her magic.|
25071|The Succubus found you! There's no getting out of this without a fight! Prepare for battle!|
25072|Elaina summons the Frost Sprite with her last dying breath.|
25073|The Frost Sprite rushes off at full speed and escapes into the abyss.|
25074|As Elaina draws her last breath, the Magic Circle starts vibrating and rumbling ominously.|
25075|Now that the Ice Wall is out of the way, you can descend deeper into the abyss.|
25076|You catch sight of the escaped Frost Sprite up ahead talking to Nilea.|
25077|They look anxious. Nilea's icy Frost Breath chills you straight to the bone!|
25078|Nilea is too ashamed to admit that you defeated her.|
25079|The creature in front is guarding a Teleport, maybe the source is hidden within.|
25080|The teleport has been sealed! You must defeat whatever's guarding it if you're to get through!|
25081|Thanks to your battle prowess, the Teleport is now open once again.|
25082|A frigid magical power passes through the tunnel, sending a chill down your spine.|
25083|The magic ritual seems to be ending. The chaos of a few moments ago begins to abate, and a crystal takes shape and hardens.|
25084|The gigantic creature in front of you seems to have been weakened due to the magic ritual.|
25085|Zahr-Kazaal is going to take the Blue Miracle to rehabilitate Keres. You must stop him!|
25086|Suddenly, Zahr-Kazaal is struck by a strange reaction, sapping his strength and leaving him weak and vulnerable.|
25087|You're about to strike the coup de grace, when suddenly, a bellowing echo fills your ears, forcing you back.|
25088|"If worry fills your heart with dread, never shall you forge ahead."|
25089|The strength of the wave took you by surprise.|
25090|As soon as Zahr-Kazaal departs, the mysterious strong man gives you a meaningful look.|
25091|It's clear you have a lot of training to do if you're to have any chance the next time a crisis like this arises.|
25092|And you can sense that you might not have long to wait.|
25093|Elaina's self destruction has left you covered in blood.|
25094|The mysterious man leaves, his laughter still ringing in your ears as it echoes throughout the cavern.|
25095|A wondrous, gleaming treasure appears with a gush of wind.|
25096|Diao Chan: "What was that? Who is disturbing the sanctity of this world?"|
25097|Diao Chan appears, elegant as ever!|
25098|Diao Chan: "You are a guest here. That gives you no right to ruin the party with insolence and shenanigans!"|
25099|Diao Chan: "I'm afraid I must ask you to leave."|

25104|Sun Altar|
25105|The doll's Soul Shield has been damaged. The remaining souls are scattering. The doll quickly casts a Protection Shield to protect itself.|
25106|Armed with the power of Puppet Hearts, the Possessed Puppet slowly approaches the doll, intent on attacking it.|
25107|The doll casts a Soul Shield to protect itself.|
25108|The doll has recycled all of the residual Puppet Hearts from the other dolls.|
25109|Souls are pouring out of the Light Orb in great numbers. They must be quickly captured and returned.|
25110|Capturing a soul generates a resonance with it, as well as a certain consciousness of how it met its end.|
25111|You feel heavy, as though you weighed several hundred pounds. This soul must have died from obesity.|
25112|You feel famished and malnourished. This soul must have starved to death.|
25113|You feel as though you are burning, and the pain is eating away at your life. This soul must have burned to death.|
25114|You feel as if you're enveloped in an intense cold, like you're gradually freezing solid. This soul must have frozen to death.|
25115|You feel as if you're shaking violently, as if racked by the pain of electric shocks. This soul must have been struck by lightning.|
25116|You feel exhausted and have an intense desire to sleep. This soul must have died in its sleep.|
25117|You feel extremely powerful, with an unstoppable rage and desire to kill. This soul must have died in battle.|
25118|All of the souls are back in the Light Orb.|
25119|The treasure chest appears in a haze of sweltering heat. Its temperature is so extreme that light itself is bent around it, causing a strange mirage.|
25120|Uriel: "You up there! Kaiser Zeta!"#br# Wait!"|
25121|When the fire dims, you can make out the silhouette of Uriel.|
25122|Uriel: "I saw this Treasure Chest first! By rights, it should belong to me!"|
25123|Uriel: "Anyone care to dispute that? My flames are ready and waiting... Now go away!"|
25124|You see many flustered soldiers as Victoria calls out to you from nearby.|
25125|It won't be so easy to attack with so many wounded soldiers.|
25126|Pick up the souls from the battlefield and deliver them to the Light of Souls in the center.|
25127|Cast facing the Light Orb to recycle the souls and place them inside.|
25128|The Soul Shield absorbs the strength surrounding the Possessed Puppets, allowing their Puppet Hearts to be absorbed.|
25129|If the Soul Shield is continuously attacked, it will lose strength and the absorbed Puppet Hearts will scatter.|
25130|Protect the doll's absorbed Puppet Hearts and kill these Possessed Puppets.|
25131|The waves emanating from the Dimensional Fissure abruptly stop.|
25132|Keres: "Humph, don't think that's going to stop us!"|
25133|Following several lightning strikes, some powerful demons appear.|
25134|The demon oppression has sent a chill through the people.|
25135|The Hell Rift seems to have generated phantoms, and a wicked strength has scattered left and right, summoning the Dimensional Fissure.|
25136|Demons are springing forth and are about to attack you!|
25137|You sense the weak soul has been absorbed.|
25138|You've recycled 40 or more souls. Still not enough.|
25139|You've recycled 80 or more souls. More than halfway there!|
25140|You've recycled 120 or more souls. Recycling will soon be complete!|
25141|You've recycled 150 or more souls. Almost there!|
25142|Suspicious giants seem to be assembling.|
25143|Don't let the giants discover you, head further in.|
25144|Perhaps the sound of the stone hitting the empty barrel nearby will distract the giant.|
25145|Talk of counter-spells, demons and giants always makes people sit up and notice. Come a little closer.|
25146|Black shadows are springing up from out of the ground, trapping you.|
25147|Still left in a daze, you find yourself back in the place you left through teleportation.|
25148|A girl appears and casts a spell. Instantly the trap springs open, freeing you.|
25149|The girl pours some potion into clear water before lightly sprinkling it on you.|
25150|Before you have the time to find out who she is, the girl waves her hand and a portal opens at your feet.|
25151|The next minute, you're by the entrance to the Hanba Tribe...|
25152|The giants have discovered you! Retreat for now and wait for your chance to carry on.|
25153|You infiltrate deep into the Hanba camp and try to locate the Giant King.|
25154|Many guards are attempting to block your way. The Giant King must be inside. Remove the obstructions.|
25155|The guards have been defeated. Keep moving forward.|
25156|You sense an aura of death that stops you in your tracks.|
25157|Another group of giants appears, blocking your way.|
25158|Such impudence!|
25159|Help the Sunhunter Tribe... kill the tribesmen... opposition is everywhere, but I'll aid you!|
25160|Get over here! You'll regret your stupidity when I send you to hell!|
25161|You defeat the Hanba King, and Zibog runs over with a flap.|
25162|Bad news! We need to get out of here!|
25163|There's something strange about the sky to the west. Something must have happened at the altar.|
25164|Drokur is definitely stalling for time. We need to quicken the pace!|
25165|Although you've won the battle, you can't feel happy.|
25166|Concerned about the situation at the Altar, you and the Makar fighters hurriedly return to the Sunhunter camp.|
25167|You sense a dimensional distortion, something you have felt once before.|
25168|Following an explosion, the Hanba Shadowbender shoots out of the strange dimension.|
25169|You defeat the Shadowbender and break the magic barrier, but you're still unable to find the soul-summoning crystal.|
25170|Hurry back and tell Cersia and Odum about it.|
25171|Enter the Hanba Tribe|
25172|Gasping for breath, you look at the girl in disbelief, but you don't recognize her.|
25173|"I heard the Demon Lord say that the putrid Lions are on the move!"|
25174|"What shall we do?"|
25175|"Don't worry, we still have the Demon Lord's counter-spell."|
25176|The giants up ahead are all huddled together, talking about something...|
25177|The Tanglevine Cascades Fish King, Eternal Epicurean has appeared! Any fisherman who's up for the challenge can go and take him on!|
25178|Sunhunter's Vale Fish King, Silent Hunter has appeared! Any fisherman who's up for the challenge can go and take him on!|
25179|Envoys of Gaia, I'm waiting for you on Ventos Prairie. You're going to find out just what it is to be powerless.|
25180|So you have a little something. Looks like we'll have some fun today.|
25181|You haven't seen anything yet. Enjoy this moment while it lasts. Hahaha!|
25182|You slice your way through the Hanba Tribe with ease, intent on capturing the King.|
25183|You cautiously infiltrate the Hanba village to investigate the strange goings-on among the giants.|
25184|The surrounding air changes. It appears affected by some unknown energy.|
25185|Gradually, a crack begins to open in the fabric of space-time itself!|
25186|In a flash of light, the Dimensional Gate opens and <Shadow Swordsman> Alger steps through to wreak havoc on the world.|
25187|The surrounding air changes. It appears affected by some unknown energy.|
25188|Gradually, a crack begins to open in the fabric of space-time itself!|
25189|In a flash of light, the Dimensional Gate opens and <Oath Sage> Sylvia steps through to wreak havoc on the world.|
25190|A rift to the Otherworld has opened somewhere in the land, and its evil is spreading.|
25191|Envoys of Gaia, your paltry resistance was not enough to defeat me. Next time, I expect a proper challenge!|
25192|It's not here...|
25193|The surrounding air changes. It appears affected by some unknown energy.|
25194|Gradually, a crack begins to open in the fabric of space-time itself!|
25195|In a flash of light, the Dimensional Gate opens and <Crescent Charmer> Ines steps through to wreak havoc on the world.|
25196|Finally! That must be the empty hut Mother Bo mentioned! So, where's the Jack-o-Lantern?|
25197|It's here!!! The Jack-o-Lantern!!!|
25198|The surrounding air changes. It appears affected by some unknown energy.|
25199|Gradually, a crack begins to open in the fabric of space-time itself!|
25200|In a flash of light, the Dimensional Gate opens and <Skyfarer> Adunis steps through to wreak havoc on the world.|
25201|The surrounding air changes. It appears affected by some unknown energy.|
25202|Gradually, a crack begins to open in the fabric of space-time itself!|
25203|In a flash of light, the Dimensional Gate opens and <Eye of God> Yvette steps through to wreak havoc on the world.|
25204|The turkey is growing! That was fast! Feed it again! Again!|
25205|Wow, it's still growing! It'll be ready to bring to Cook soon...|
25206|... Curses, it escaped. Well, feed another one!|
25207|Shiloh: It's time to fight back! The Ham League will never surrender!|
25208|Reid: Allies of the Lightning Gang! Our reinforcements have arrived! Let's teach our enemy a lesson!|
25209|Start reading the scroll from the Drunken Monk out loud.|
25210|Take out the delicious Roast Chicken from the Drunken Monk...|
25211|Use the baton to smash the ground with all your strength.|
25212|Now that you've found the three disciples, take them to the Drunken Monk!|
25213|Big Bro Monkey Caught!|
25214|Bro Porky Caught!|
25215|Little Bro Turtle Caught!|
25216|Attracted by the happy atmosphere, a group of tanuki has arrived bearing fireworks.|
25217|The exhausted tanuki are leaving.|
25218|Attracted by the romantic atmosphere, a group of tiny sheep has appeared with candies.|
25219|The exhausted tiny sheep are leaving.|
25220|A group of squirrels has summoned sheep and tanuki to celebrate with you.|
25221|All of the animals are tired. They're starting to leave.|
25222|Periwinkle: The elite weapons have arrived! Draw your weapons and fight!|
25223|Claret: The elite weapons have arrived! Shatter their bones!|
25224|Unable to attack and Move SPD -50% when affected by Arcane Curse.|
25225|The damage your special weapon can sustain has almost reached the limit. Please try to be careful.|
25226|You've arrived at the ancient castle. Yeshe should be inside.|
25227|Before you're able to take a step forward, a figure appears.|
25228|Yeshe focuses his mind, trying to clear the path for you.|
25229|The mind-controlled Yeshe is straight ahead! You must defeat Yeshe for him to regain control of his mind.|
25230|Yeshe disappears after you defeat him. However, it's clear things are not yet over...|
25231|The path has been cleared. Keep moving forward.|
25232|Heaps of mind-controlled sprouts lie ahead. Perhaps one of them is Yeshe.|
25233|You guessed wrong! Defeat the monsters and continue to search for the real Yeshe.|
25234|Yeshe appears and begins attacking you. He must be mind-controlled. Defeat him quickly!|
25235|Once defeated, Yeshe disappears again. It seems to be another illusion created by the ancient power.|
25236|This looks like it could be the real Yeshe. As you approach, he yells a warning, imploring you to stop.|
25237|Yeshe writhes in agony as a tremendous evil energy envelops him, preventing you from coming any closer.|
25238|The evil energy vibrates wildly until it reaches its limit, whereupon it causes a devastating shockwave. Yeshe has now completely lost control!|
25239|The only way to stop him is to defeat him.|
25240|Looks like you should confirm the answer before switching the device.|
25241|Perhaps take a look at some other devices.|
25242|But nothing happens. The fog disperses after a while.|
25243|There are quite a number of Magic Circles and ruins appear out of thin air. Looks like you cannot pass.|
25244|Caresha tries to incant only to find that she's unable to manipulate the mana.|
25245|You attempt to use the Power of Gaia and it works. But you feel somewhat strange.|
25246|A transparent figure appears.|
25247|The transparent butterfly fairy disappears.|
25248|The butterfly fairy appears again. But it seems to be injured.....|
25249|The spirit does not look good while looking in another direction.|
25250|"Please, break through the seal and save us......"|
25251|The fairy leader's voice echoes in your ears.|
25252|Victoria: My intuition is telling me to be careful!|
25253|Victoria: Don't let your guards down even when you see the fairy leader.|
25254|Victoria: I... don't think I can trust the leader.|
25255|Victoria gives Caresha a Necklace.|
25256|Five Butterfly Fairies appear behind you and charge!|
25257|Victoria's ring starts to glow and after a bright flash of light, Victoria and Caresha have changed places.|
25258|There's a crackling sound coming from Caresha's necklace.|
25259|Defeat the Demon Lord with Victoria.|
25260|You've been ambushed! Looks like you will have to defeat them before you can pass!|
25261|You defeated the Wicked Phantom. You can feel that the evil presence has dispersed.|
25262|Is it an earthquake?|
25263|No, it's a trap!|
25264|You can hear a loud noise as if an engine is revving up.|
25265|You've arrived at the deepest reaches of the forest...|
25266|Let's go, but stay alert!|
25267|Investigate the ruins and nearby objects.|
25268|A boulder stands up ahead, and on the bridge, there is a wall of wind that blocks the way.|
25269|As soon as you touch the stone, the wall of wind vanishes.|
25270|Nothing happens.|
25271|Please s-save me... this hurts too m-much...|
25272|Heeheehee... which is the real Yeshe?|
25273|The device emits three rays of light in different colors to the crystal...|
25274|Should be some kind of hint...|
25275|"Trespasser locked on. Spell - Time Freeze activated. Releasing Guardian." You hear a voice in your head.|
25276|You look at Victoria and Caresha. But they seem not to have heard anything. You can tell that a strange mark has set its sights on you.|
25277|Anyway, wipe out the monster first!|
25278|After taking out the monster, you can sense that the strange mark has disappeared.|
25279|The obstacle is removed...|
25280|You've set foot in a mysterious place. As you look around, Yeshe appears before you.|
25281|Upon closer inspection, it seems to be a projection of Yeshe. His face conveys a sense of urgency.|
25282|Mind-controlled Rehia is engaged in a fierce battle with Zinnia!|
25283|Rehia incants a spell that summons countless fire taps.|
25284|He then leaps through the traps, effortlessly avoiding them and disappearing into the distance. You'll have to make it through the traps if you want to catch up to him|
25285|Rehia's magic fizzles as you make your way through the traps, disarming them.|
25286|Rehia has a completely demeanor than what you've come to know of him. All of a sudden he lunges at you!|
25287|Zinnia appears seemingly out of thin air and strikes Rehia with a fierce blow to the face!|
25288|The evil power controlling Rehia flees as Rehia regains consciousness.|
25289|It seems your business here is done. Zinnia will take care of the rest.|
25290|You can see various energies coiling around the thorns ahead of you.|
25291|They are Fire, Lightning, Holy Light and Dark from layer one to four, respectively.|
25292|Yeshe ascends into a beam of light and disappears, leaving behind a trail of dust to guide you.|
25293|You follow Alex and Marden to the path, but the fellow soldiers can no longer hold on.|
25294|Investigating the dead Butterfly Fairy, you get a Shining Stone.|
25295|As you are wondering how to use it, the stone suddenly breaks into pieces.|
25296|Corpse of Butterfly Fairies are all over the place. Looks like the demon has raided them.|
25297|Watch out, enemy attack!|
25298|There are not many enemies, but they are no average demons either.|
25299|It must be the Elite Raid Team. Be careful!|
25300|Enemy Ambush from behind! I'm counting on you! |
25301|You tell her that you can make it and prepare to mobilize the energy inside you.|
25302|Caresha starts the Unfathomable Incantation and you can feel that your energy is being transformed into some sort of essence that is imbued with life force.|
25303|Derrick, what an interesting farce... I enjoyed it.|
25304|Something that is imbued with powerful energy falls from a demon... Could that be the "Queen's Token"?!|
25305|The Fish King Blurred Void in Chronology Forest has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take on the challenge can go and fight him soon!|
25306|The Fish King Titan of Tempest Desert has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
25307|Suddenly, the earth started shaking as a powerful force intruded on Port Morton!|
25308|Suddenly, the earth started shaking as a powerful force intruded on Candetonn Hill!|
25309|Suddenly, the earth started shaking as a powerful force intruded on the Viridian Steppe!|
25310|Suddenly, the earth started shaking as a powerful force intruded on the Desolate Valley!|
25311|Those without the Ruins' Blessing cannot enter the area where the Holy Relics are located.|
25312|Challenger who defeated Challenge Tome 1|
25313|Challenger who defeated Challenge Tome 2|
25314|Challenger who defeated Challenge Tome 3|
25315|Crush the ritual vessels!|
25316|Let's move forward|
25317|There's the second one, hurry up and crush it.|
25318|The followers are moaning in pain, you feel the evil aura in the air thickening.|
25319|A large spider demon crawls out from the summoning circle, hurry up and defeat it!|
25320|Once you're ready, let Baron lead the way!|
25321|Isai is defending the attacks from the back, hurry up and crush the rest of the ritual vessels!|
25322|Don't let the plan fail! Kill them!|
25323|A great evil aura blocks your way.|
25324|Defeat the enemies ahead of you!|
25325|Leave this place to us and crush the ritual vessels!|
25326|What is this monster?!|
25327|The evil aura has triggered Isai's old afflictions, crush the ritual vessels!|
25328|After making sure that all the ritual vessels are destroyed, you leave this place.|
25329|Baron knows where the ritual vessels used for the summoning magic are kept, you decide to let him lead the way.|
25330|The low temperature is making you tired, somehow you have gotten lost.|
25331|You can't stop and so continue slowly up the icy path.|
25332|You can't believe your ears, it sounds like someone is calling out to you.|
25333|The voice is getting clearer, go have a look!|
25334|A girl is being attacked by an otter, save her!|
25335|Lona seems like she needs help, go check it out.|
25336|After confirming the information, you board the flying ship.|
25337|The bad weather forces you to leave the ship and continue on foot.|
25338|Girl: Aaaahh!!|
25339|Lona: Please help me, I'll finish soon!|
25340|Follow Lona!|
25341|Lona: I'm done here, now let's get outta here!|
25342|Another pack of otters were attracted by your voices.|
25343|There was another lost traveler here a few days ago, but he's much weaker than you.|
25344|The village is busy now, so it's up to me to take care of him.|
25345|This slope will lead to Icy Village!|
25346|Agh! They're back!|
25347|Lona: Come on, let's go! The village is just straight ahead!|
25348|Phew, we should be safe here.|
25349|Lona starts walking again, follow her!|
25350|The Fish King from Frigga Peak has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
25351|The Fish King from Desolate Desert has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
25352|A large crack stretching from Viridian Steppe to this world is exposing us to a wicked powerful entity.|
25353|There is no doubt that you are a true Envoy of Gaia. You have wasted enough of my time. The little kid must be already home. I must bolt!|
25354|Look! The sky is emblazoned with brilliant fireworks. The onlookers below seem transfixed by the colorful display.|
25355|With each pop and sizzle a celebratory cheer erupts from the crowd as the fireworks illuminate the sky over Navea. Even the on-duty soldiers appear to be having a good time.|
25356|The fireworks continue to shoot into the air one after another. It's a perfect anniversary celebration!|
25357|Navea's legendary School of Fish has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
25358|Fill up the empty bottle with water from the Lake of Horror.|
25359|The bottle is full of water!|
25360|You sense someone watching you sinisterly.|
25361|You feel a change in the air, like something fearsome is roaming nearby.|
25362|You hear an ominous creaking sound.|
25363|It's April, the wife of the Takoyaki Stand Owner. Hurry up and hand her the Takoyaki.|
25364|Retrieve the cooked food from the bonfire.|
25365|The Abyss Liar, Fish King, and the Secret Forest Lake have appeared! Any fishermen who are interested can go and challenge him soon!|
25366|The Silent Torture Dance appears in Hidden Valley! Any fishermen who are interested can go and challenge him soon!|
25367|Collect Wild Herbs|
25368|The rage of Gods descended upon the Desolate Desert and made the wicked aura slowly spread.|
25369|Even so, you are still far too weak Envoy of Gaia, you better get stronger for our next meeting.|
25370|Defeat Decrepit Lion|
25371|Arrive at the East of Demarech Mines.|
25372|Arrive at the Northwest of Demarech Mines.|
25373|Arrive at the Southwest of Demarech Mines.|
25374|At the location marked on the Magic Dandan's map, a few blades of green grasses are swaying in the wind.|
25375|A dark aura is enveloping this area, looks like the Decrepit Lion is here.|
25376|Deliver the Christmas Pastries to Lil' Muse.|
25377|Deliver the Christmas Pastries to Lil' Chris.|
25378|Successfully transformed into Santa Claus.|
25379|There's a sneaky red figure in front of you. Quickly check it out!|
25380|You have been affected by the magical Mischievous Ball and are unable to move!|
25381|A Sprite is waving at you anxiously. The situation is urgent! Go check it out!|
25382|A group of Pestilence Bugs are heading towards the Rainforest! Use Honey Flower Pollen on them! Stop them from reaching the Rainforest behind Luwhawa!|
25383|A Pestilence Bug has reached the Rainforest. The Rainforest is damaged...|
25384|The bug barrier is set up. All the Pestilence Bugs have left.|
25385|Giant Pestilence Bug has appeared! Honey Flower Pollen doesn't work against it! You'll have to defeat it!|
25386|The Giant Pestilence Bug has fallen, report back to Luwhawa!|
25387|Christmas Thief: Hey! Why are you so close to me! Get lost!|
25388|Christmas Thief: No! Don't catch me! I don't want to be turned into a Chicken Sprite!|
25389|Isai: This is...?|
25390|Isai: This power... Looks like the previous struggles were useless.|
25391|Isai: Envoys of Gaia, are you here to stop me?|
25392|Isai: Stop wasting your strength! Yield to the darkness in your heart!|
25393|Isai: You wish to reject your own destiny?|
25394|Isai: You're not strong enough yet.|
25395|Isai: Come if you're capable. I'm waiting.|
25396|Following a familiar yet unsettling aura, a wave of darkness descends upon Secret Forest Lake.|
25397|You know where to find me.|
25398|The Fish King of Gloomy Ridge, Gorge Lord, has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
25399|The Fish King of Drowsy Cave, Sliver Shadow, has appeared! Any fishermen who want to take the challenge, can go and fight him soon!|
25400|Place the Otium Crystal in Diabulus.|
25401|Place the Otium Crystal in Noxum Town.|
25402|Place the Otium Crystal in Sideralis Square.|
25403|Heeding your call, God Doggo Niveus appeared! Go collect some festival items with it!|
25404|Used Ingot Treasure Pan to collect festival items.|
25405|This doesn't appear to be the place Niveus asked you to look for items. Best follow his instructions!|
25406|Use the God Doggo Talisman to summon Niveus.|
25407|Used Ingot Treasure Pan to collect festival ingredients.|
25408|Now that it's been lit, the Festival Pot is beginning to bubble.|
25409|Relight the Festival Pot.|
25410|Hurry to the Barbecue Grill Ayako summoned to return to your human form.|
25411|Use the "Rub Belly" skill for a chance at Landing and returning to your human form. This skill can be used more than once.|
25412|As soon as you hit the stone tablet, the room becomes pitch black.|
25413|Robin: "Tell me what happened! Did we trigger something?"|
25414|A chorus of mechanical whirs and clicks accompany a whooshing sound.|
25415|Robin: "Wonderful! It looks like we cleared the trial!"|
25416|Robin: "Nothing seems to be happening... Maybe try it again?"|
25417|The Goblins seem to be moving very slowly. Based on the Old Villager's description, this doesn't seem to be the thief who took the letter...|
25418|The water snakes don't stray too far from the water and the Old Villager was robbed on land. The thief who took the letter shouldn't be...|
25419|The little squirrel is quicker and stronger than most. The letter thief could be...|
25420|A small Goblin appeared recently and looks very suspicious...|
25421|A nest of water snakes has appeared by the shore...|
25422|Several squirrels have popped up nearby. One of them is exceptionally small...|
25423|This goes beyond what Bach said. It could be dangerous if we stay. Explore this level quickly then get out!|
25424|Tremors strike this level frequently. Find Bauer and learn more about it.|
25425|I've begun to forget things ever since that falling rock hit me.|
25426|Bauer: "It seems something triggered a device."|
25427|Bauer: "We've collected all the fragments! The mechanism has been activated. We can finally head to the next level."|
25428|I was struck by the animated statue. It hit pretty hard, but I'll survive.|
25429|Kalev: "The seal is broken. Hurry and explore the ruins while it's still safe!"|
25430|The ground rumbles and you hear something happening with the team members up ahead.|
25431|You enter the room and ask Gibreel what happened.|
25432|Look closely at the image of the giant ball next to you to pinpoint where traps are.|
25433|Avoid the traps and carefully dig for clues.|
25434|Collect all four pieces of the note and reassemble it.|
25435|The note is whole again! This must be what Gibreel was looking for. Give it to him right away!|
25436|A grinding sound can be heard and a treasure chest appears somewhere else.|
25437|Robin seems to be inspecting a mysterious stone tablet. Go see what it can do.|
25438|It seems the mechanism has revealed treasure once again.|
25439|You will turn into Dante for one minute. Pandora is always on the lookout for Dante, so watch out.|
25440|Thompson: Hey! Vick! Let me show you something!|
25441|Vick: What did you bring back this time? Captain Charlie's going to have another fit when he sees this.|
25442|Thompson: Hmmph, who does he think he is anyway? When I make it rich, it'll be me ol' Charlie'll be bowing to!|
25443|Thompson: With this Blood Crystal... Man, as long as I have this, I'll be blessed with riches beyond imagination!|
25444|Vick: There you go daydreaming again... Isn't it better to be realistic?|
25445|Thompson: Just you wait and see! Once I make all that money... Wait, what's this feeling...|
25446|Thompson: Noo... M-my body... Raghhh!|
25447|Vick: Oi, what's wrong with you? Stay back! Don't come any closer! Arrghhhh!|
25448|Jenner: Looks like everyone's here. Ancestors, let us honest a time-honored challenge to help us deem the most authentic!|
25449|Tzada: Hmph! I'll let my actions do the talking! Fries with ketchup is the only way to go!|
25450|Jenner: Hold your deceitful tongue! The ancestral spirits bless only warriors who eat fries with sweet-and-sour sauce!|
25451|Tzada: The challenge begins! Drink it!|
25452|Jenner: It appears that the ancestral spirits are in favor of sweet-and-sour sauce!|
25453|Tzada: No!|
25454|Jenner: I won! I'm going to set fire to all the ketchup! Sweet-and-sour sauce is the victor!|
25455|Tzada: You haven't won yet.|
25456|Tzada: I'm still alive! Did you really think you could kill someone from this height?|
25457|Tzada: The challenge is not yet over! Let us proceed!|
25458|This place is infested with Fluorescent Snails. I worry that they'll eat the seed right up.|
25459|This place seems nice, which can't be said about those Fanged Bats flying overhead.|
25460|It's far too dangerous here. We're likely to get attacked by Corpser Bandits before getting the seed into the ground.|
25461|Huh? Is there something glowing beside me?|
25462|This place always feels...sort of eerie.|
25463|The necklace in your hand begins to vibrate, then becomes scorching hot.|
25464|An old gravestone suddenly appears before you, as if heeding the necklace's call.|
25465|It seems... This was just what you were looking for...|
25466|Ha! Wise friend, from today onward, we Mountain God Brothers will regard you as a friend.|
25467|Its original beauty has been eroded by the evil aura, rendering it virtually unrecognizable.|
25468|A sudden flurry of excitement and chaos ensues.|
25469|Marge grasps the flute and runs off.|
25470|Hurry up and go take a closer!|
25471|A sudden flurry of excitement and chaos ensues.|
25472|Don't eat m-me... Please don't eat me!|
25473|Heehee, that tickles!|
25474|Go plant the World Tree Seed.|
25475|How strange.|
25476|The Blood Crystal isn't reacting... Should we look for someplace with more people?|
25477|At the girl's question, darkness passes before your eyes.|
25478|Curse Breaker Otto from the Holy Shield Fortress would know what's happening with the Broken Blood Crystal. Go look for him!|
25479|Just as the man touches the crystal, fragments of memories leak from it.|
25480|Just as you touch the Formed Crystal Shards, a long-lost memory appears before your eyes.|
25481|Search around the Marsh Wetlands.|
25482|Search around the Silent Hills.|
25483|Search around the Corpser Camp.|
25484|I don't know why, but after passing through the purple flames, I ended up at the entrance to Noxum Town.|
25485|Here's the water Phillip mentioned. Use your camera to take a photo!|
25486|You doubtfully hand the spring water to Lang. Will this really do the trick?|
25487|You head with Lang to the walls of Silent Ancient Castle to see the truth revealed.|
25488|With a bang, your gender instantly changes! Go look for Kermaine for help!|
25489|Latour: "Military sources point to Magnus' last sighting at Silent Ancient Castle."|
25490|Latour: "I'll send Jett with you. He'll know if Magnus is among the fallen."|
25491|You leave the area where you searched for Magnus, while Jett trots dutifully back to Latour.|
25492|While trying to determine which soldier could be Magnus, you heard Jett suddenly bark in the distance.|
25493|It looks like Jett found Magnus! You hurry over with Latour.|
25494|The Blood Crystal appears to be the cause of Noxum Town's destruction. Go look for the evil source of this terrible tragedy!|
25495|You have obtained information about the Blood Crystal.|
25496|I got the Sarpa on film! Bring the proof to Phillip!|
25497|There don't appear to be traces of any Sarpa here. Head to the waters near Sideralis Square!|
25498|Invite people to review|
25499|Strike the opponent|
25500|Obtained Ordinary Wheat|
25501|You get a whiff of something strange when picking up the wheat.|
25502|There appears to be a Foodie Folk just ahead. Go and treat him to some of Qian's Banana Cake!|
25503|The Dark Eidolon Energy Crystal descends from the sky...|
25504|Halthim: "Blast! You actually won..."|
25505|Halthim: "Unleash the darkness within your heart! And let yourself destroy!"|
25506|Bealdor: "Thank you for your help, and may the Holy Light shine upon you!"|
25507|Welcome to the Ace Duel Temple, Challenger!|
25508|Maybe there's been word about the Floral Essence. Follow his trail and have a look!|
25509|Get out your best decks and compete against the Legendary Raid Team!|
25510|Challenger, you have participated in enough duels today...|
25511|You will be returned to Navea in 3 minutes.|
25512|The Ace Duel Temple is being prepared...|
25513|Please wait 1 minute before re-entering...|
25514|The Evil Spore King has appeared! Quickly, defeat him!|
25515|Xines has fallen. Quickly, head to the next room!|
25516|A figure stands at the end of the room. You can hear Louise calling your name from somewhere close by...|
25517|Louise sands nearby, smiling at you...|
25518|You seem to have entered the world of books...|
25519|Endora plays alone in the laboratory...|
25520|Endora faints and upon waking, finds that the laboratory has transformed into a magic cave...|
25521|A powerful thunderbolt suddenly descends from the sky...|
25522|Kusanagi: "The blood of the serpent has subsided..."|
25523|Kusanagi: "Creatures in this land! Contemplate the punishment I gave you..."|
25524|Kusanagi: "The blood of the serpent died down, and the Holy Light blesses you!"|
25525|Kusanagi: "Ah! The blood of the serpent began to burst into anger..."|
25526|Kusanagi: "See the power of the serpent's blood..."|
25527|Long live Master Alucard!|
25528|Gimme! It's mine!|
25529|You have been announced by "Judgment Blade". Beware!|
25530|Alucard: "Your spirit is admirable!"|
25531|Alucard: "But you won't able to defeat me!"|
25532|Alucard: "Your strength is quite surprising."|
25533|Alucard: "Then you'll be free to go."|
25534|Red light is glowing on him, use Crimson Power.|
25535|Dark Attribute appears on him, use Dark Violet Power.|
25536|Water is coming out of him, use Blue Water Power.|
25537|A strong light is glowing on him, use Light Power.|
25538|Green crystals are forming on him, use Jade Power.|
25539|Cleverly disguised as a ghost, you enjoy the Ghost Nocturnal atmosphere.|
25540|You venture deep into the forest with the other party members...|
25541|Your intuition tells you there is something amiss nearby...|
25542|Use the compass, and make sure you stay together!|
25543|The brigand leader has appeared and is harassing the party! Defeat him and protect the villagers!|
25544|Looks like this is not the best time to use the compass. Take a look up ahead.|
25545|What?|
25546|Shoot! Fire at will!|
25547|You have left the test area.|
25548|You failed the test. Try again in 3 minutes.|
25549|Is everyone ready?|
25550|Then let's begin!|
25551|Thank you all for supporting Muse.|
25552|Until the next time!|
25553|Flames shoot up all around and the corpses of many soldiers appear.|
25554|I can't see the residential area...|
25555|Not in the lakeside area...|
25556|Nor in the sanctuary area...|
25557|Humans really are so insignificant.|
25558|Agni's rage manifests as real flames.|
25559|Drive off the Gluttonous Beasts.|
25560|The ground is shaking! What's happening?!|
25561|Defeat Barthes.|

25563|Recount everything that happened before.|
25564|Search in the residential area.|
25565|Search in the lakeside area.|
25567|Search in the sanctuary area.|
25568|All of the Gluttonous Beasts have been driven away. Hurry and tell Academic Ayako the good news|
25569|Ayako seems to have encountered a problem. Go and see him.|
25570|Wil of the forest! Hear my call! Defend your home!|
25571|The forest's will manifests as Sprites.|
25572|He may have help, but the old guy is no match for this king!|
25573|The epidemic is virulent here. Hurry and ignite the pile of Artemisia.|
25574|The smoke from the Artemisia pile is effective and the pathogens begin to disperse.|
25575|The Guardian Rock restoration team is here to support us!|
25576|The Tower Sorceress! The Time Sorceress is here to support us!|

25597|Squirt the Assassin Association's special drug into their eyes and they will temporarily lose their sight.|
25598|The protection seal is gradually regenerating.|
25599|Rickman's bag is seriously heavy.|
25600|Opening other people's mail without permission is a huge no-no, but for the sake of Vegs' safety, an exception can be made.|
25601|Hey, it's a group of partners who are good at catching ghosts!|
25602|Come on. I'll be the ghost first. You'll be next.|
25603|Oh, I am really happy to spend such a fun time with you!|
25604|Next time, I'll take you to the Pandemonium.|
25605|Hel and Gram hit you at the same time! Try to dodge to avoid getting a lot of damage!|
25606|Let's get grilling!|
25607|Hmm. Still could use a little something...|
25608|Hmm. Still could use a little something...|
25609|Brush on the tangy barbecue sauce...|
25610|Gently flip the meat...|
25611|Voila! The perfect skewer!|
25612|The sky is suddenly ablaze, and several pillars of light spill to the ground.|
25613|So then, until next time... I'll go and report back to my father.|
25614|Urgh. This wedding dress is practically swallowing me whole. I need to change into something else.|
25615|Everyone, on your guard! We need to prevent the next attack!|
25616|Use the specially-cooked roast turkey. Set it out and carve it with a cleaver.|
25617|Here's the first portion.|
25618|And the second...|
25619|There, that's three. Hurry and take the turkey to Katherine.|
25620|Hyah! Here come Zephyrine and Nakama!|
25621|Hehehe... Oh, do you want to play with me too?|
25622|Great! It's always so cold and dark in Pandemonium, so it's great to play with everyone!|
25623|Ah... It's great to hang out with everyone, but Zephyrine and Nakama need to go back...|
25624|The Judgement Hall kind of lonely... But if we don't go back, people will worry!|
25625|Anyway, thanks for playing with us... Let's meet again soon, all right?|
25626|Astraea said everyone was happy after she changed, so I want to change too!|
25627|If you hit the wrong Nakama, you and those around you will change into her. Find the real Nakama to unlock Zephyrine's status.|
25628|......:(|
25629|......:$|
25630|......XD|
25631|York still hasn't returned, so you and Katherine decide to head for the entrance to greet him.|
25632|Back at the house, Katherine serves up a sumptuous meal.|
25633|Feeling spoiled by the two of them, you dig into the delectable Thanksgiving feast...|
25634|Go on, open it! Open it! It doesn't matter how...|
25635|This one... It's for luck!|
25636|What do you think? Like it?|
25637|Congratulations on your blessing!|
25638|Oh! I've failed!|
25639|A magic teleportation circle suddenly appears in the air, and a figure makes its way toward you...|
25640|This time the spirit is first handed over to Odin. Until we meet again!|
25641|After setting the trap, hide behind the mountain and wait for the Evil Chick to take the bait.|
25642|Momo has made off with both the Evil Chick and the corn... Go back and report to Sherry.|
25643|The Evil Chick still hasn't appeared... Return one more time.|
25644|Evil Chick No.4: "You'd better stop!"|
25645|Evil Chick No.4: "Just leave this to me. Hurry and get out of here, No.3!"|
25646|You catch a vague glimpse of a figure in retreat... Evil Chick No.3 is on the attack.|
25647|Catch the Evil Chicks! Talk to Shena and report your progress.|
25648|Evil Chick No.4: "Psh! I'm out of here! If you're serious about catching me, you'd better get moving, dummy!"|
25649|Change me into a heroic soul, Goddess Harmonia. (Fight)|
25650|It seems there was a mistake... Check again...|
25651|Araki Treant began to absorb the Corrosive Breath in the Abandoned Orchard, and the Antidote Fruit appeared!|
25652|Araki Treant is spewing out High Concentrated Corrosive Breath!|
25653|Without the absorption power of the Antidote Tree, a High Concentrated Corrosive Breath has filled the orchard!|
25654|The Antidote Tree is beginning to absorb the Corrosive Breath, and the gas concentration has reduced slightly!|
25655|The Antidote Tree is absorbing the Corrosive Breath, and the gas concentration has reduced greatly!|
25656|The Antidote Tree has absorbed the Corrosive Breath, and the gas has been removed!|
25657|The Corrosive Breath has destroyed a Patron Saint Statue, and Araki Treant has lost some protection.|
25658|According to eyewitnesses, the Evil Chicks may sleep in cooler places in the Stone Hammer Tribe. Go check it out.|
25659|What a nice scent... It's coming from everyone!|
25660|What is this crowd all about? Do you want to play with me?|
25661|If I win, you have to give me delicious food! We have a deal!|
25662|If I lose...|
25663|Even though there wasn't anything to eat, I still had fun.|
25664|I have to visit Hel in the Pandemonium, let's play together next time!|
25665|Ayako is going to unleash a protection shield that blocks all damage, and has started to recover HP!|
25666|Move towards the red circles and use Special Skill to attack Ayako and stop her.|

25762|The Queenie of the Celestial Guardians has been able to find a suitable place to breed in order to preserve their race...|
25763|She left her beloved people, Shawa and Aidan here...|
25764|Soon after, Flower and Aidan grew up, and built their own tribe...|
25765|One day, a group of strange dragons suddenly flew from the sky...|
25766|Celestial Guardian Queenie: My child...From now on you will live on your own.|
25767|Shawa: Where are you going, Queenie??|
25768|Aidan: Why can't we continue to follow Queenie?|

25773|Shawa: Don't be afraid. We must protect our homes and not disappoint Queenie.|
25774|Black Dragon: Tsk, it looks like this place is pretty good. Being banished isn't such a bad thing!|
25775|Scarlet Dragon: Black! Those creatures look delicious. You must be hungry. I'll go and cook something for you!|
25776|Aidan: They're coming! Shawa, hurry up and hide with everyone!|
25777|Aidan: It seems that the other party has retreated, I did not expect to encounter such horrible creatures.|
25778|Shawa: They must be the Sky Dragons that the Queenie mentioned. They say they can live for thousands of years. I must keep a record to warn the future generations.|
25779|Black Dragon: Our noble family, the Sky Dragons, has been banished to this accursed place! I can't even beat a bunch of low graded creatures!|
25780|Emerald Dragon: And I didn't expect those little guys to defeat the Sanguinary Star, what do you think?|
25781|Sapphire Dragon: Hey Black, they look a bit like the Celestial Guardians that I've encountered before.|
25782|Sapphire Dragon: They may look weak, but it's quite tricky to keep up with their numbers. And our tribe has been weakened...|
25783|Sapphire Dragon: Let's train our strength first, and then we'll be able to revenge once we recover!|
25784|Black Dragon: Let's go! Next time we meet, they'll pay up!|
25785|The Fireball of the Scarlet Dragon is about to explode! Evade!|
25786|Help Aidan defeat the Scarlet Dragon!|

30082|Protect the children! Flush out the enemies in the ruins and take the kids home.|
30083|Bavolaz: Hmm. It seems my lesser demons didn't give you any trouble. How about this one?|
30084|You must defeat Hivenan before you can get the children out of here.|
30085|(You holler at the kids, letting them know it's time to get out of here.)|
30086|Louis: Thank you! We're getting' out of here!|

30093|Sheldon needs your help in dealing with the Golden Flowertraps. Pick some dried mushrooms and use them to lure the Flowertraps away from Sheldon's gold.|
30094|Ask Sheldon what he's looking for.|
30095|Talk to Sheldon again and see if there is anything you can do to help.|
30096|You set out a Fragrant Mushroom as bait for a Golden Flowertrap.|
30097|You hear something huge nearby. Did the Flowertrap Lord take the bait?|
30098|There are more Grudge Robots blocking the way. Destroy them!|
30099|Keep following Billy and keep him safe.|
30100|Destroy the Grudge Robot blocking the path.|
30101|Aaaaagh... you got me...|
30102|You see all of these discarded robots here? I'm going to rebuild them...and lead them in an uprising against humanity!|
30103|Defeat the Green Overlord.|
30104|Talk to Billy and report your progress.|
30105|Proof that you've safely escorted Billy.|
30106|Little Purple Fuzzball: Ow! That hurts, you know! Hey! Quit it! That's it, I'm leaving!|
30107|You place the Fragrant Mushroom on the ground, hoping to draw the Golden Flowertrap's attention.|
30108|You hear dozens of footsteps approaching. It's a horde of Golden Flowertraps!|
30109|It seems all the Golden Flowertraps in the area want some of that Fragrant Mushroom.|
30110|They're so desperate for the mushroom, they've begun fighting one another.|
30111|The Golden Flowertrap melee has reached a fever pitch. It's probably best to keep your distance.|
30112|The Golden Flowertraps went nuts when they smelled the Fragrant Mushroom, and will destroy anything that might keep them from it.|
30113|Golden Flowertraps are dropping all over the place, and yet the brawl shows no signs of abating. It's not long before the last one drops.|
30114|Head to the entrance and see if you can convince the Demon Recruit to let you in.|
30115|Keep heading toward the altar.|
30116|Up ahead you see what looks like a cage. Without warning, Lola runs up to it.|
30117|Defeat the demon and rescue the sprite.|
30118|Radamog: Did you really think you'd rescue her that easily?|
30119|Radamog: You'll have to ask my pets if you can take her. I wouldn't get your hopes up, though - she IS their dinner, after all.|
30120|Destroy the barrier and continue moving toward the altar.|
30121|Demon Recruit: Attention! Intruders! Someone is trying to rescue the sprite!|
30122|I need to take care of my sister; she's hurt really badly!|
30123|Keep moving toward the altar so you can rescue the sprite.|
30124|I'm impressed that you made it this far. But this is where your little rescue mission ends.|
30125|Keep moving towards the altar so you can rescue the sprite.|
30126|Go with Lola to defeat the Abyssalisk!|
30127|Hmph. Not bad, human. You seem to have some skill after all.|
30128|But now you face a foe like no other. Bring it on!|
30129|Break through the barrier around the altar and confront Radamog!|
30130|Pitiful human! You'll never be able to stop my ritual!|
30131|You think you've won? Don't make me laugh! I shall return when I've recovered my strength!|
30132|After your battle with Radamog, you find that Lola has healed her sister. The two of them have approached the sprite.|
30133|Quest complete! Report to Lola.|
30134|Thank you for all of your help. I wish you all the best in your travels.|
30135|Keep following the patches of light until you reach the Old Tomb Light Orb.|
30136|Enemies are attacking constantly, trying to keep you from rescuing their offering.|
30137|Cenobite Wizard: Don't feel too bad. You'll make a fine snack for our Demon Flowertrap!|
30138|Trollclops: How dare someone try and interrupt my ceremony and steal my Infinity Grass!|
30139|You hear the unmistakeable sound of children fighting.|
30140|Ray: You're such a jerk, brother!|
30141|You might want to head over there and see what the argument is all about.|
30142|Step forward and challenge Bavolaz.|
30143|Get rid of the enemies blocking the path so the kids can continue on home.|
30144|You picked the mushroom, but couldn't think of a use for it, so you threw it away.|
30145|Sheldon: The Golden Flowertraps are sure to be back soon. Please stop them from eating my gold!|
30146|Keep picking Fragrant Mushrooms. You need them to bait the Golden Flowertraps.|
30147|Young Golden Flowertraps have stolen the bait! Defeat them so you can use the bait on the adult Flowertraps!|
30148|Get rid of the Young Golden Flowertraps as quickly as possible.|
30149|After you defeated the Flowertrap Lord, Sheldon and his assistant approached you.|
30150|Must... attack... humans!|
30151|Grudge Robot: Attack... now!|
30152|How dare you... even think... of taking... my robots!|
30153|You've picked enough Water Flowers. Give them to Meira so she can weave them into a Flower Crown.|
30154|Proof that you helped Meira.|
30155|Meira took the blessed Flower Crown from the sprite's hands.|
30156|Well done! You should report to Meira.|
30157|You should defeat the three big yellow ones.|
30158|30158|
30159|30159|
30160|30160|
30161|30161|
30162|30162|
30163|30163|
30164|30164|
30165|30165|
30166|I'm here!  You hear the Bright Red Flower asking for help.|
30167|Looks like the witch is heading towards the village - catch up with her quickly!|
30168|There's a Bandit Sentry ahead. Think of a way to start a fire to catch his attention.|
30169|Spotted by the Guard! Gotta beat a temporary retreat...|
30170|You set fire to the rations, causing thick smoke to billow out.|
30171|Successfully started a fire and caused chaos in the Enemy's Camp. Taken by surprise, the Bandit Sentry left his post.|
30172|Successfully started a fire and caused chaos in the Enemy's Camp. The bandits scurried around the fort looking for the cause.|
30173|Beat them! No need to fear frightened bandits!|
30174|Discovered rations. If special tinder is used, a fire can be started immediately. (If you don't have the special tinder, you can get it from Al at the entrance.)|
30175|Discovered rations. If special tinder is used, a fire can be started immediately.|
30176|There are Guards all over in front - try to burn the rations on both sides to lure them away.|
30177|There are Bandit Sentries all over - burn the rations at the four corners to lure them away.|
30178|The Fort is on fire!|
30179|You useless rabble! You hear the Boss roar furiously.|
30180|Don't anyone  even think of passing through!|
30181|Fire..fire...it's on fire!|
30182|Run away! There's a fire!|
30183|A specter appears before you...|
30184|The tinder set fire to the rations instantly.|
30185|It can't be! My-my fortune! My glory! Why you little...!|
30186|After Al's father disappeared, you found the hidden rations.|
30187|This place is going to collapse! Get over here, quickly!|
30188|Successfully started a fire. The Guard has left his post - take the opportunity to defeat him!|
30189|Successfully caused a fire in the hall. The Guard has left his post - take the opportunity to run through!|
30190|The Fire Wall blocking the exit collapsed instantly...  |
30191|Al's Father appeared in front of the throne in the hall...  |
30192|It's not a good idea to fight with the Bandits here - get away quickly!|
30193|Al's Father disappeared on the way to the exit...  |
30194|Enemies appeared everywhere!|
30195|You've been ambushed.|
30196|(You hear someone murmuring in your ear) The fire isn't big enough; it has to burn the rations in all four corners....|
30197|We're still too late...  |
30198|Use this moment to rush inside!|
30199|Continue onward after defeating the Guards.|
30200|There's no need to create any more chaos here.|
30201|You heard sounds coming from upstairs...  |
30202|There's a bandit cruising for war rations! Quickly, defeat him!|
30203|Try talking to Al's Father.|
30204|The commissioner is ahead; talk to him first.|
30205|The poisonous mist before you smells horrible.|
30206|These seem to be the missing villagers, but there's something suspicious about them...  |
30207|These villagers are monsters in disguise! Defeat them!|
30208|Save me... You hear the Red Flower asking for help.|
30209|A voice rings out from the Altar within: "Don't think of leaving here..."  |
30210|You have been turned into an animal by the Witch. Go hide somewhere safe and wait for the effect to fade.|
30211|You hear a weak voice: "Please help me..."|
30212|I'm sealed inside the Red Flower. Please break me out, I beg you....|
30213|You have no way of advancing without my help...|
30214|Who broke into our village? Crazy Mudlings appear, deep within the village.|
30215|Continue onward!|
30216|Horrifying... Be careful not to anger the Witch.  |
30217|Lilian started to chant the spells, and as she finished, Leia's Clones appeared one by one.|
30218|You fake! I'm going to expose you!|
30219|Cheryl suddenly vanished, and you find yourself surrounded by Mudlings.|
30220|Llewelyn looks a little bit strange... You should check to see if he's ok.  |
30221|It would seem that the villagers are caught in a dangerous predicament. You should hurry towards the center of the village.|
30222|First you must target and defeat the Mudlings!|
30223|A piece of paper with gold trim captures your attention.|
30224|The curse is now broken! The villagers have transformed back into their human selves!|
30225|That witch is moving very fast! Hurry up, don't lose her!|
30226|All of a sudden, the Bright Red Flower turns into a girl!|
30227|Lilian rushes into the depths of the Altar. Quickly, follow her!|
30228|It's a trap! The Mudlings are going to surround you!|
30229|Llewelyn's spirit appears at the Altar!|
30230|You feel that you will not be able to pass through this place. Talk to the priest and see what you must do.|
30231|You've been transformed into an animal! Before the magic wears off, find a safe place to hide.|
30232|It's not yet possible to pass through here.|
30233|Strange how easy it was to find the Charm Queen...  |
30234|You shiver uneasily and try to pick up a scent in the air.  |
30235|Alex: The enemy is before us! Finish them off!|
30236|As soon as the Charm Queen disappears, a group of soldiers appears.|
30237|There is a strong magic pulse ahead!|
30238|"Hehehe... you don't give up, do you?"|
30239|"You should come out and greet the guests!"|
30240|You make your way to the frontlines.|
30241|The Charm Queen is the opponent...  |
30242|I have to join the fight!|
30243|Go support your allies!|
30244|The Charm Queen vanishes with a smile...  |
30245|"I'll play with you again later... Hehe!"|
30246|A force prevents you from advancing.|
30247|"Looks like my babies want to play. Hehe!"|
30248|Work together to defeat the Queen and the blind bugs!|
30249|We're ready. Let's kick some butt!|
30250|When you're ready to attack, stand on the indicated area.|
30251|At last, we're here! Looks like the fight has been going on for awhile...|
30252|How's the battle going?|
30253|Okay. I'll forge ahead and provide support!|
30254|The Charm Queen falls to the ground, dead...  |
30255|"Haha - of course it's not that simple!"|
30256|The Charm Queen reappears!|
30257|The dead Charm Queen has attracted large numbers of blind bugs!|
30258|Everyone saw many images of the Charm Queen.|
30259|As this war drags on, our casualties mount...  |
30260|We must defeat the Charm Queen and end this war!|
30261|The images of the Queen disappear, and swarms of blind bugs pour from the ground!|
30262|The Charm Queen's body emits Miasma and continues burning...
|
30263|Attack!|
30264|You finally made it! Quickly - Alex and the others are fighting the Charm Queen!|
30265|Odum and Para are pursuing the Charm Queen. Finish off the blind bugs first!|
30266|You rush to meet the troops, who are preparing to attack.|
30267|This is where Alex and the others will fight the Charm Queen again!  |
30268|The Charm Queen seems to have something else in store.|
30269|Her retreat is quite unsettling.  |
30270|The Otter is no longer angry, pain has made it come to its senses.|
30271|The Otter calms down, and begins investigating its surroundings. |
30272|The confused soldier looks around. He appears to be trying to figure out what hurt him.|
30273|"Akh!" (The Otter lets out an angry cry.)|
30274|"Ouuuhh!" (The Otter lets out an unsettling moan.)|
30275|Reymon: "Use your Taming Methods to tame the Otter!"|
30276|The Otter is getting used to you.|
30277|You've tamed the Otter. Pierre is ready, as well, so now it's time to remove those landmines.|
30278|Use "Dig" at suspicious locations and Pierre will handle the rest!|
30279|Talk to Reymon to learn how to tame the Otter!|
30280|You've successfully tamed the Otter. Report back to Reymon.|
30281|Pierre: "Four down! Keep up the good work!"|
30282|Pierre: "That's five! Don't give up now!"|
30283|Pierre: "Great! You're at six now. Just one more to go!"|
30284|Countless landmines have been buried in Otter Marsh. Taming the Otter is the only way to avert the crisis!|
30285|With the Otter and Pierre's help, all of the landmines have been removed. The crisis is resolved!|
30286|Tame the Otter and use it to remove these landmines.|
30287|They need to be removed before there are any casualties.|
30288| It looks like we'll first have to dispose of all these Sandworms!|
30289|Pierre: "The first landmine is gone! Don't get cocky, now."|
30290|The Otter has just recovered from the anesthetic and is wandering around in a daze.|
30291|Pierre: "Thanks a million. All the landmines are gone!"|
30292|Oh, no! Some magical force has stopped me...|
30293|Feed the Otter some fodder and observe its behavior to complete the taming process.|
30294|The eldest Makar prince has been poisoned - his body still hasn't returned to normal.|
30295|Ill as he is, he has made the trip here for the rune on the tablet. He is consumed with grief over failing to protect his younger brother...|
30296|Evade the Werewolf Tribe Guards on your way to the tablet. When you arrive, use the Enchanted Memory Sphere on the tablet.|
30297|The Werewolves begin to gather, but Palo seizes the moment to charge into the Abandoned Cult Village.|
30298|Evade the Werewolf Tribe Guards and proceed to the innermost tablet.|
30299|Werewolf Tribe Guard: "Who's there?!" (You've been spotted! The guards are now searching for you.)|
30300|The newly arrived guard seems to have something important to report.|
30301|You've been discovered by the Werewolf Tribe Guards! Find a hiding place.|
30302|Things have calmed down outside. Take this opportunity to locate the tablet.|
30303|Find the tablet and use the Magic Memory Ball on it.|
30304|Suddenly, Stone Tablet Sentinels surround the tablet. |
30305|It's an ambush! Time to fight...|
30306|As planned, you start a commotion in the Abandoned Cult Village.|
30307|Defeat the Werewolf King and foil the Shadow Knight's plans!|
30308|Where the tablet once stood, there are now only the scars of battle and the corpses of fallen Stone Tablet Sentinels. |
30309|Defeat the horde of Werewolf guards!|
30310|The second wave of Werewolf guards is attacking!|
30311|Watch out! The closer you get to the tablet, the tighter Werewolf security will be.|
30312|The Werewolf King has appeared!|
30313|Mia: "Mission accomplished! Let's rendezvous with the Eldest Prince and the others."|
30314|Mia's Eidolon deals a quick and deadly blow to the Werewolf King, interrupting the curse.|
30315|Although the Werewolf King is defeated, there's no joy in this victory.|
30316|The inscription has already been sent to the Winged Duke!|
30317|We're too late again...|
30318|Security is extremely tight here. The tablet must be somewhere up ahead.|
30319|It must be up ahead...|
30320|Defeat the Werewolf King's guards!|
30321|Another pack of werewolves! Defeat them!|
30322|Werewolf King: "You blithering idiots... I'll tear the sinews from your flesh!"|
30323|The Werewolf King has arrived with his guards, and he's chomping at the bit to get his claws on you.|
30324|With the their king destroyed, the werewolves scatter like scared puppies.|
30325|The Werewolf King is casting a spell! You can't move a muscle!|
30326|The Werewolf King has cast a spell on the area. Everyone is affected!|
30327|The Werewolf King has cast a spell on the area. Everyone is affected!|
30328|"Die, you filthy creature!" Just as Mia finishes talking, the Werewolf King begins to radiate a brilliant, white light.|
30329|The Werewolf King utters a few final words, then lies still. |
30330|The Enchanted Memory Sphere shines brightly as the inscription is completed.|
30331|The Werewolf Guards seem restless. Quickly, find a hiding place!|
30332|The Werewolf Guards have left the tablet unguarded. Something outside seems to be drawing their attention.|
30333|This is your chance to reach the tablet!|
30334|Yes, sir! (The guards are so frightened, they begin to leave the village.)|
30335|Did... Did someone get past us?|
30336|Or am I just being paranoid?|
30337|No one gets past us!|
30338|All hail the king!|
30339|The poison takes hold of Palo, sapping away his strength and decreasing his body mass.|
30340|Luckily, due to his smaller size, he's able to avoid being detected by the Werewolves.|
30341|The Werewolves are distracted by the commotion from outside. Quickly, get to the tablet!|
30342|The Werewolves walk right past you - hiding behind the bushes seems to have worked.|
30343|The Werewolf Guards are frantically repeating the Werewolf King's orders...|
30344|Looks like everything is going smoothly on the other side.|
30345|Monsters are coming through the portal and laying waste to the land.|
30346|You and Erika proceed deep into the Beastbone Plains to attempt to destroy the gate.|
30347|When you're ready, talk to Erika about destroying the portal.|
30348|The portal is just ahead. When you're ready, proceed to speak with Erika.|
30349|Locate the portal and destroy it before a stronger Monster emerges!|
30350|You found the portal!|
30351|Erika casts a spell on the Enchanted Energy Sphere, creating a Magic Circle of flames.|
30352|The Fire Spirit summoned by Erika bestows its powers upon you.|
30353|Warning! If you leave the Magic Circle, you will lose this power.|
30354|Erika: "Casting this spell will take some time. You'll have to protect me!"|
30355|Erika: "The energy accumulation has gone smoothly so far. Keep me safe - we can't let anyone interrupt the ritual!"|
30356|Erika: "I can feel the Fire Spirit power growing. I just need a little more time..."|
30357|Erika: "Just a little more..."|
30358|Erika: "These wretched Monsters interrupted the ritual! I have to start over..."|
30359|Erika: "Okay, we've accumulated enough energy. Keep a lookout for me."|
30360|A massive fire engulfs the portal, reducing it to ashes!|
30361|You hear Erika's voice as you slowly lose consciousness...|
30362|Suddenly, you hear a mysterious voice.|
30363|"Open your eyes."|
30364|"The Shadow Knight? Where am I..." Is this real, or just an illusion?|
30365|"Stop him!"|
30366|The unknown voice fades away, and your vision blurs again...|
30367|You can feel your consciousness slipping away...|
30368|The portal is destroyed!|
30369|Seeing that the portal is about to be sealed off, Monsters begin to leap through it.|
30370|Erika: "Excellent! The Energy Spheres are ablaze with flame. Now, the next attack has to be prepared a bit more carefully."|
30371|Another wave of Monsters! Soon they'll emerge from the portal!|
30372|A horde of Monsters is attacking!|
30373|The Sealing Spell is ready. A powerful blast of light instantly annihilates the Monsters!|
30374|A fierce beam of light descends from the portal.|
30375|The portal closes thanks to the Fire Spirit's attack.|
30376|You feel giddy with excitement... but Erika realizes that something is amiss.|
30377|You see the Shadow Knight, placing a flower upon the Icebound Sarcophagus.|
30378|A mysterious woman turns toward you. It seems as though she wants to say something...|
30379|An aura of relentless evil is flooding out the portal. Talk to Erika.|
30380|A mysterious, evil aura seems to hover just inside this portal...|
30381|The earth trembles violently, and the Fire Spirit appears!|
30382|Overwhelmed by the Fire Spirit's power, the Monsters are instantly turned to ashes!|
30383|Remain within the Magic Circle to acquire skills. Press 1 and 2 to use these skills to defeat the Monsters!|
30384|The demons are attacking! Finish the building upgrade to end the conflict.|
30385|To fight the demon protection shield, you must collect the weapons from the Artillery Tower.|
30386|Use Crystalline Ores, found deep underground, to build a fortress.|
30387|The Ancient Emerald Tree stands ahead: use it to upgrade the Artillery Tower and receive higher-grade weapons.|
30388|The fortress has absorbed the Mana Crystal Ore. More energy is needed.|
30389|The fortress' energy level is now above 25%. More energy is needed.|
30390|The fortress' energy level is now above 50%. More energy is needed.|
30391|The fortress' energy level is now above 75%. More energy is needed.|
30392|The fortress has absorbed enough mana. You can now proceed to Stage 2 and build more temporary bases to protect the troops.|
30393|The fortress construction is complete!|
30394|The bottom left Artillery Tower has absorbed elemental energy. More elements are needed.|
30395|The bottom left Artillery Tower's timber stockpile is now above 25%. More elements are needed.|

30400|Warning! The demons have torn open a hole in the middle of the battlefield!|
30401|Warning! The energy-gobbling demons are getting closer to the tree and crystal ore - you must stop them!|
30402|Warning! A powerful magic has accumulated! Hide inside the temporary base.|
30403|Attack successfully blocked. The temporary base is now closed.|
30404|Alarm: Warning! Demons are attacking!|
30405|A shrill alarm sounds as a demon horde appears on the battlefield.|
30406|Quickly complete the building construction and end this battle!|
30407|Up ahead you sense energy flowing from a cache of resources. Gather the resources and use them to build the fortress and Artillery Tower.|
30408|You have successfully gathered Timber, which is needed to upgrade the Artillery Tower.|
30409|You have successfully gathered Mana Crystal Ore, which is needed to upgrade the fortress.|
30410|The battle between humans and demons has only just begun. More demons have appeared!|
30411|Move the Magic Circle to the fortress or the front of the Artillery Tower to channel all resources.|
30412|Attention: The Demons' Turret is on the battlefield and is attacking the fortress.|
30413|Use the Mech Prototype skill "Absolute Defense" to block the attack.|
30414|The fortress has been breached! Close the Artillery Tower, shut down the robot, and open the Temporary Base to protect the troops!|
30415|Recovery succeeded! The fortress has opened the Artillery Tower.|
30416|The illusion fades, and the Giant Spirit Demon's arrival surely spells disaster for the humans. |
30417|Sensing the coming danger, the fortress activates its defenses and sends robots to the battlefield.|
30418|The Artillery Tower is now open! Enter the tower to acquire robot abilities.|
30419|Powerful demon energy has been detected. Do not enter the battlefield unless there are robots present.|
30420|Attention! The fortress raised its shield to protect itself from the curse.|
30421|Ashe has found a fuel tank. Help him blow it up!|
30422|The fuel tank has exploded! The demon is terrified of heat. Ignite a raging fire and raise the temperature!|
30423|Disappeared...  |
30424|Powerful demonic energy floods the area. Its force will weaken anyone outside the stronghold.|
30425|Robots and those within the fortress will be unaffected by the energy.|
30426|Protect the fortress! Access the arsenal and activate the robot!|
30427|You discover a fuel tank. Blowing it up will raise the temperature and eliminate demons and robots.|
30428|A sense of dark evil pervades this place, and the demon statues seem to call out to their comrades on the battlefield.|
30429|The statues can only be damaged by defeating the demons.|
30430|The demons are attacking - protect the stronghold! |
30431|Warning! Demons are attacking! The anti-demon robots await their orders.|
30432|Warning! Air Raid alert! The anti-aircraft robots await their orders.|
30433|The demon army is en route! Use the robots to destroy them.|
30434|The demons take to the skies, protected by crystals. Use the anti-aircraft robots to destroy the crystals!|
30435|The energy field changes abruptly. The demons are wreaking havoc throughout the area!|
30436|Warning! Hit by demon energy! The robots are forced to retreat.|
30437|Warning! Mana reaction destabilization. The demons will destroy everything!|
30438|Warning! Stronghold has detected demon reinforcements. Open the Artillery Tower and join the fight!|
30439|The demons' defeat has weakened the Giant Spirit Demons in the area!|
30440|The first Giant Spirit Demon has fallen, but more demons are coming!|
30441|The second Giant Spirit Demon has fallen! Help Ashe dispatch those demons!|
30442|The third Giant Spirit Demon has fallen! Time for us to make a come-back!|
30443|The fourth Giant Spirit Demon has fallen! Only one left....|
30444|We have annihilated every last Giant Spirit Demon and won the battle!|
30445|Uh-oh, a Hidden Demon has appeared, and it is healing the other demons!|
30446|A horde of demons has arrived at the base!|
30447|The left Artillery Tower's timber stockpile is now above 25%. More elements are needed.|

30458|The right Artillery Tower has absorbed elemental energy. More elements are needed.|
30459|More demons are here! Only robots can cause effective damage!|
30460|Every last demon has been destroyed. Just as the human prepared for victory...|
30461|...a dark, ominous creature drops from the skies! The Giant Spirit Demon is not through slaughtering humans.|
30462|Ashe is on the battlefield! Help him fight the Giant Spirit Demon!|
30463|A feeling a dread grips you; the imps must be back!|
30464|Ashe uses a force that neutralizes the demons' protective shield!|
30465|The fortress has been breached! Activate the recovery process, and close the Artillery Tower and fortress.|
30466|Demons are attacking! Hurry to the Artillery Tower and defend it!|
30467|The demons are back! Help Ashe destroy them!|
30468|Only one Giant Spirit Demon left! Victory is upon us!|
30469|This amazing underground area has an unusual magnetic field.|
30470|Go and talk to the Monster Research Director!|
30471|Use the summoning device that the Head of the Institute gave to you to summon the Monsters!|
30472|You sense a some magical power that has been teleported here along with the twisted space.|
30473|The Head of the Institute retreats to safety after distributing all the summoning devices.|
30474|Collect a summoning device from the Head of the Institute and summon the Monsters in the middle of the Research Institute!|
30475|Use the special summoning device bought from the Item Mall in the middle of the Research Institute to summon the Monsters!|
30476|A horde of Stone Golems are walking towards Aveline!|
30477|Aveline is not afraid of the approaching Stone Golems. She utters a spell to build up a barrier.|
30478|Defeat these Stone Golems and collect the Stone Guard Soul for Aveline, so that she can complete the ceremony!|
30479|The phantom that is Aveline turns real, and starts to attack!|
30480|You have been cursed by the Flame Serpent. Approach the Frost to break the curse.|
30481|You have been cursed by the Frost. Go close to the Flame Serpent to break the curse.|
30482|More Stone Golems appear from the ground!|
30483|Enraged to see that their brethren have been defeated, more Stone Golems have appeared!|
30484|The powerful shock created by the ceremony has defeated all the Stone Golems.|
30485|The ceremony has absorbed energy from the Stone Golems. Looks like more energy is needed.|
30486|The ceremony has transformed 20% of the energy. More energy is needed.|
30487|The ceremony has transformed 50% of the energy. More energy is needed.|
30488|The ceremony has transformed 80% of the energy. More energy is needed.|
30489|The ceremony has drawn enough energy from the Stone Golems. Aveline has completed the ceremony!|
30490|Aveline has summoned Frost and Flame Guardians while immune to damage.|
30491|Defeating Guardians will cause Aveline to lose this immunity!|
30492|When all the Guardians have been defeated, Aveline will be vulnerable again.|
30493|Aveline becomes angry and casts a powerful Draconic Curse!|
30494|You have defeated 100 Stone Golems. Help Aveline find the Stone Guard Soul!|
30495|You have defeated 150 Stone Golems. The number of Stone Golems coming from the underground starts to decrease.|
30496|You have defeated 200 Stone Golems. The number of Stone Golems coming from the underground decreases significantly!|
30497|You have defeated 250 Stone Golems. The Stone Golems don't have much energy left now!|
30498|Defeat all the Stone Golems. You will not be able to succeed with the illusion if the ceremony cannot be completed.|
30499|The Stone Golem energy in the illusion is going to dry up soon. The ceremony starts to take in large amounts of this energy!|
30500|The crystal with the sealed memory has appeared. Break it open to return the memory to Gram!|
30501|When attacked, the crystal will move into attack mode! Be careful!|
30502|The Crystal Guards descend! They are sending all the crystals up in the sky...|
30503|The crystals are being sent up to the sky under the protection of the Crystal Guards... |
30504|Defeat all Guards to bring the crystals back to the ground!|
30505|More Guards have arrived!|
30506|The Shadow Guard Chief has arrived! The crystals are sent up to the sky under his protection...|
30507|Defeat the Shadow Guard Chief in order to collect the last crystals.|
30508|You have defeated the Shadow Guard Chief. The crystals are back on earth!|
30509|Gram consumes his broken memories, seemingly responding to them in some way.|
30510|20% of the memory recall completed. More memory fragments needed.|
30511|50% of the memory recall completed. More memory fragments needed.|
30512|80% of the memory recall completed. More memory fragments needed.|
30513|Memory fragment recollection completed. Activating memory connection...|
30514|With a wrathful scream, the phantom Hel suddenly takes mortal form, and starts to attack!|
30515|Hel morphs into Fire Hel, summons Gram and starts to burn Purgatory!|
30516|Hel morphs into Wind Hel, summons Gram and starts sending strong winds!|
30517|Hel morphs into Ice Hel, summons Gram and starts to freeze the entire earth!|
30518|Fire Hel is oblivious to the damage she has caused. Defeat Gram to make her wake up and take responsibility for all the horrible things she's done.|
30519|Wind Hel is oblivious to the damage she has caused. Defeat Gram to make her wake up and take responsibility for all the horrible things she's done.|
30520|Ice Hel is oblivious to the damage she has caused. Defeat Gram to make her wake up and take responsibility for all the horrible things she's done.|
30521|As soon as Gram is defeated, Hel's transformation is lifted.|
30522|More Guards have arrived to this piece of mud!|
30523|These disrespectful galoots shall all be punished!|
30524|A large group of Shadow Guards is defeated, and the Memory Barrier starts to shake...|
30525|As broken memories start to be resolved, there is a sudden backlash of energy. When the surge subsides, the guards and the crystal remain sealed.|
30526|Four treasure chests are in front of you. Going at them without a good plan is probably unwise. They are likely to be sealed with protective curses.|
30527|Step into the Magic Circle, and use the godly power therein to break the curse.|
30528|Four curses for four sealing powers. Now it's up to you to decide.|
30529|This Magic Circle can give you power and break the curse.|
30530|You have received the power to withstand the ice curse.|
30531|You have received the power to withstand the fire curse.|
30532|You have received the power to withstand the dark curse.|
30533|You have received the power to withstand the light curse.|
30534|The fire curse has been removed, and the treasure chest disappears.|
30535|The ice curse has been removed, and the treasure chest disappears.|
30536|The light curse has been removed, and the treasure chest disappears.|
30537|The dark curse has been removed, and the treasure chest disappears.|
30538|All curses have successfully been removed. A job well done!|
30539|Scheel lets you know he is hostile, launching an attack.|
30540|Scheel disappears in front of everyone's eyes. It seems he has hidden himself away in another dimension.|
30541|"Guess where I'm hiding? Break the right crystal, and I will appear... Heehee!"|
30542|"You actually got it right! That's no fun..." Then Scheel reappears. |
30543|You guessed wrong! Prepare for a punishment! Hohoho!|
30544|An evil, cursed dragon! What do you think?|
30545|A dragon, created by swords and darkness. You're about to find out just how evil it can be.|
30546|Lucky you, you get to play with a little Hornwolf... one with a shocking amount of electrical power.|
30547|Scheel reappears as his phantom is defeated.|
30548|The Evil Spirits that protect the treasure chest have appeared.|
30549|You killed 50 Evil Spirits, weakening the curse.|
30550|You eat Evil Spirits for breakfast-- you've killed 100 of them!|
30551|You're the Evil Spirits' worst nightmare! The curse has been greatly weakened with the loss of 150 Evil Spirits.|
30552|Defeated 200 Evil Spirits! All the Evil Spirits have been eradicated, and the curse has been broken.|
30553|The elemental energy in your body is in a state of chaos. You are unable to use this energy now.|
30554|The phantom cannot possibly be stronger than the real thing. Crush Aveline! Give her a taste of an Envoy's wrath.|
30555|The phantom cannot possibly be stronger than the real thing. Crush Fenrir! Give him a taste of an Envoy's wrath.|
30556|The phantom cannot possibly be stronger than the real thing. Crush Gram! Give him a taste of an Envoy's wrath.|
30557|The Magic Circle seems unstable. It will need some time to regenerate.|
30558|The Malicious Spirit appears!|
30559|This Malicious Spirit will be more difficult to deal with than the other Evil Spirits, so focus on destroying it first!|
30560|30560|
30561|30561|
30562|30562|
30563|30563|
30564|Following the orders of the Grand Bishop, Gus appears in the holy city!|
30565|Envoys of Gaia, come to the Sky Tower.|
30566|"The Grand Bishop would like to announce some good news."|
30567|"Aura Kingdom was awarded a Gold Medal in the Best Online Game Category in Game Star 2014.|
30568|"Thank you, Envoys of Gaia, for your support, and for making it possible for Aura Kingdom to achieve this for the second time in a row."|
30569|"The Church will spend 50 million Gold to invite the best fireworks makers in Midgard to put on a fireworks extravaganza."|
30570|"And we are announcing that the City of Navea will hold a seven-day celebration."|
30571|"Every night at 7:30 PM, there will be fireworks at the Sky Tower!"|
30572|"Don't miss this opportunity to see these fireworks."|
30573|"The fireworks display will end soon. Don't miss your opportunity to see it."|
30574|"Good night, everyone. Thank you, Envoys of Gaia, for your participation. See you next time."|
30575|"Let the fireworks begin!"|
30576|A huge flow of energy rushes forward, Zephyrine is risen in the Guild Hall!|
30577|When Zephyrine vanishes, the energy flow subsides.|
30578|It's a trap! The Flametongues have been deployed!|
30579|The thorns have been burnt to the ground. There seems to be a switch to turn off the trap.|
30580|The trap is disarmed. You can proceed now.|
30581|Intruder detected. Activating defense system.|
30582|Rehia has activated an Ice Ward to protect you from the Flametongues. Follow him to keep advancing!|
30583|Corrupted Grass Kingdom Residents have appeared! Fend them off while you continue to advance!|
30584|The trap is disarmed. No more Flametongues have been deployed.|
30585|Destroy the device on the other side to stop the Flametongues from being deployed.|
30586|Moe has appeared! He's being controlled by an ancient evil!|
30587|Why are there so many Moes?!|
30588|Moe seems to have regained his mental clarity.|
30589|It looks like you have no choice but to take out the evil Moe first!|
30590|The Ice Field is demolishing part of the Fire Wall!|
30591|The Gaia Cube glowed with Eidolon Energy. It looks like something is going to happen.|
30592|The Gaia Cube has appeared at the Sky Tower... Come and look!|
30593|The connection to the Power of Gaia must have created it!|
30594|Hurry, Envoys of Gaia! The Gaia Cube is calling everyone.|
30595|Let's say farewell to the last day of the old year.|
30596|So many Gaia Cubes are circling around. This is amazing!|
30597|The Cube of Gaia shines with an almost blinding light.|
30598|Marina stands in the square before the Sky Tower. Something must be about to happen.|
30599|The Power of Gaia is coalescing in front of the Sky Tower...|
30600|Eidolons are appearing!|
30601|The Eidolons begin to gather around the Gaia Cube.|
30602|Let's welcome in the new year!|
30603|Here's to a new year with new hopes and dreams.|
30604|Let's prepare for the countdown!|
30605|No matter what happens in the year to come, we'll all face it together.|
30606|May this year be even better than the last one!|
30607|Happy New Year!|
30608|Thanks to all the Eidolons for accompanying everyone on their adventures!|
30609|The Cube of Gaia disappears as the event comes to an end.|
30610|Thank you, Eidolons, for watching over us.|
30611|Please guide us through this new year as you have through the old.|
30612|Let's prepare for the countdown!|
30613|No matter what has happened this year, the Eidolons will always watch over you.|
30614|May this year be even better than the last one!|
30615|Happy New Year!|
30616|Thanks to all the Eidolons for accompanying everyone on their adventures!|

30618|Thank you, Eidolons, for watching over us.|
30619|Please guide us through this new year as you have through the old.|
30620|Let's go! Help me protect them!|
30621|30621|
30622|Yeshe looks at you expectantly. It's time to find out what's happening.|
30623|The barrier has been removed and the path forward is clear.|
30624|You've acquired a mystical power that can lift the evil curse.|
30625|Barrier removed!|
30626|You've found Iron Moe!|
30627|You've found Rehia!|
30628|You've found Iron Cole!|
30629|You've saved the Grass Kingdom.|
30630|Use the power of the corresponding color to remove the seal.|
30631|Use the power of the corresponding color to remove the barrier.|
30632|The Princess is fighting against the ancient evil!|
30633|You must defeat it! And protect the Princess!|
30634|"Despicable! This is not over yet!" The ancient evil erupts into a swell of black smoke and vanishes.|
30635|One layer of the barrier has been removed.|
30636|The Test of Light starts. The link between Light Abyss and the Altar can last less than 15 minutes...|
30637|The apparition of Nalani appears!|
30638|You broke Nalani's apparition!|
30639|Crystal of Light appears. Be careful with the Light Blade!|
30640|The apparition of Nalani appears!|
30641|More Crystal of Light appears.|
30642|Nalani arrives -|
30643|You broke Nalani's apparition!|
30644|You have passed the Test of Light! Everything is back to normal, as if the Test had never happened.|
30645|More Crystal of Light appears.|
30646|Holy Apostle arrives from Aura Kingdom. He attacks the surrounding apostles and defeats them from long range!|
30647|After 5 minutes, the link of the Light Abyss starts to weaken.|
30648|It has been 10 minutes. The link o the Light Abyss continues to weaken.|
30649|After 12 minutes, the link of the Light Abyss becomes weaker... |
30650|One more minute and the Light Abyss will be completely closed...|
30651|The Light Abyss is completely sealed now... |
30652|Apostles arrive again!|
30653|A fissure into the Otherworld has opened, causing an abnormal compression...|
30654|With the power of the Otherworld diminishing, the crack has closed.|
30655|Unknown creatures from the Otherworld have entered through the crack!|
30999|30999|
31001|Go deep into the mine and find the Hell Rift.|
31002|Click on the Light-Marked Spots.|
31003|The Hell Rift has been sealed by the Holy Light.|
31004|I still haven't given you the tool to seal the Hell Rift! Come back first!|
31005|Venture inside to check - there should be be quite a number of cracks.|
31006|Monsters have already come out of this crack. Defeat them first.|
31007|Shane followed after you, after making sure no more dangers lurked within the crack.|
31008|Surprise! The cyclops spotted you.|
31009|Looks like another crack has opened not too far from here.|
31010|A hoarse howl echoes from deep within.|
31011|Arkham: There's a rat who's really making a mess here!|
31012|Arkham: Brothers! Bring me the corpse of that rat!|
31013|Shane: We're done for! The cracks in the deep have burst wide open!|
31014|Shane: The next enemy won't be a pushover. Be careful.|
31015|The next one's just behind the bridge. Go!|
31016|Arkham: I smell a rat. Go and get it!|
31017|Arkham: Those in the rear, provide support! Quickly now!|
31018|Other Side of the Crack: Boss! There are too many of us - we're all jammed in here and can't get out!|
31019|Arkham: It's all your fault, you dirty rat! I'm gonna enjoy crushing you!|
31020|A bloodthirsty Giant emerges from the crack.|
31021|The bloodthirsty Giant clambers back into the crack.|
31022|Other Side of the Crack: You up front! Don't move back; I'm sandwiched in here!|
31023|Set the Lamp facing it. (Right-click to use the Lamp of Love, Courage, and Hope.)|
31024|Feels like there's another monster coming out! Be careful!|
31025|This should be the last of them.|
31026|During the battle, cracks begin to appear on the Demon King's Eye Necklace.|
31027|Check in with Isaias and keep him safe as he searches for the Treasure Map.|
31028|Something strange is happening to all of the Crystal Ore.|

31031|Confirm the commission with Daisy.|
31032|Go deep into the Mine and look for Basil's tracks.|
31033|The egg on the ground looks like it could hatch into a bug at any time.|
31034|When you approach the egg, it hatches into a larva.|
31035|Basil: Hey! I'm in the deepest part!|
31036|Basil: Look at all these eggs. I'm approaching them now...|
31037|Basil: They look like they're about to hatch, but I won't bump into them.|
31038|Looks like a colossal creature rounding the corner of the passage.|
31039|Basil: He... Help! Come and kill them!|
31040|An intense battle shakes up the cave, raining down a flurry of stones that hit the queen bug.|
31041|Approach the area with the eggs and defeat the monster there.|
31042|A sharp shriek from the queen echoes from deep within the cavern.|
31043|Basil ran to the entrance of the mine with Daisy.|
31044|Basil: Aaaaagh! Bugs! Don't come any closer!|
31045|A group of bugs appears from behind and gives chase.|
31046|Basil: Soon...we'll be at that exit before we know it!|
31047|Daisy: Wait, seems like there's still something ahead!|
31048|The queen suddenly appears near the exit.|
31049|Basil and Daisy: Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!|
31050|Defeat the queen bug to help Basil and Daisy escape.|
31051|Finally...is it really over?|
31052|We should call the association and have someone study the bug eggs.|
31053|Haven't you seen enough of those bugs?|
31054|Daisy: Basil! Are you alright?|
31055|Sickle Spiderlings sprung up everywhere, blocking Basil and Daisy's way.|
31056|Basil: Thanks! I'll keep going, then.|
31057|Reid: They started the fight! Can you help the Lightning Gang beat the Ham League?|
31058|Shiloh: Don't be smug, Reid. The Ham League is just getting started!|
31059|Shiloh: The Ham League will never give up!|
31060|Shiloh: You guys are toast! Hogan can take down ten of you all on his own!|
31061|You see raging flames ahead, not far from here. Check out the situation.|
31062|Myria noticed you behind her. She turned, speaking with a smile.|
31063|Myria: Oh! Are you here to help get rid of the mollusks?|
31064|Talk to Myria to check on the situation.|
31065|Exterminate all mollusks nesting in this area.|
31066|Myria walked in after checking that no mollusks are nearby.|
31067|Two incubators sit in the corner, trying to hatch the mollusks' eggs.|
31068|Miriya: Hatched or not, we have to burn them all.|
31069|Miriya: Lucky us! This nest has no mollusks.|
31070|Many molluskss appear in the passageway.|
31071|Miriya: Mollusks are coming into the passageway! D-drive them off!|
31072|Miriya: A big, fat mollusk is blocking the way. Help me!|
31073|Venture further in and find the next nest.|
31074|This group ofmollusks realized that they're no match for you. Looks like they're gong to try something else...?|
31075|They fused together, and fused again...|
31076|And again...|
31077|A gigantic mollusk has appeared! If you don't kill it, Miriya will be in danger.|
31078|Miriya: Leave it to me! Just wait a second!|
31079|An intense vibration emanated from deep inside the burnt nest.|
31080|Along the narrow passageway, an endless stream of newly-hatched larvae come crawling out.|
31081|Miriya: There must be queen mollusks hatching them! We have to stop them!|
31082|A furious queen mollusk crawled out from the sea of fire.|
31083|Miriya: Dear Gaia! This one is mega-disgusting! Quick, get rid of it!|
31084|Miriya, hiding on the side, stepped out trembling.|
31085|Unsettling noises can be heard from deep within the cavern.|
31086|Oscar: Mina! I know you're in there! Just give me the treasure!|
31087|Oscar: Mina! Stop wasting time! Give yourself up and come out!|
31088|Oscar: Fine, be that way, Mina! I'm coming in after you!|

31091|The Dream Mage was surprised to see you. You should check with him to see if anything is amiss.|
31092|Go with Edward and help him defeat the monster.|
31093|Edward: Please defeat the monsters here!|
31094|Edgar hurried up to the altar.|
31095|You feel a steady stream of magical energy flowing from your body.|
31096|Continue delving deeper into the Ruins.|
31097|The mound in the corner has a strange shape, almost like something is buried beneath it.|
31098|Edward: We're finally here! This place is...|
31099|Edward: What? This shouldn't be a monster's lair!|
31100|Edward: You have to get rid of them! We can't let them desecrate these ruins!|
31101|A furious Enchanted Crawler squirms out and attacks you!|
31102|Edward: How can I ever thank you? Now we can truly enjoy these marvelous ruins!|
31103|Edward: Look at this spectacular mural!|
31104|Edward: And look at this majestic door!|
31105|Edward: And this exquisite sculpture... wait!|
31106|Edward: Is this a...corpse? Could this be...|
31107|Go over to Edward and take a look at what he's found.|
31108|Edward: This door must certainly be guarding some unbelievably sacred item.|

31121|The Ferocious Eclipse Rabbits on guard discover you and cry out, alerting their companions.|
31122|Ferocious Eclipse Rabbit: There's an intruder! Everyone, catch them!|
31123|Not good! Look at all of them... I'd better find a place to hide first.|
31124|The road here has been blocked by rotten tree trunks, with no way to pass through.|
31125|A Moonlight Rabbit is waving at you. Maybe she can tell you what's going on.|
31126|Luna seems to have heard something, and signals you to be quiet.|
31127|Shhh... I can hear the footsteps of a Ferocious Eclipse Rabbit headed this way.|
31128|You see an Eclipse Rabbit heading towards you, but it doesn't seem to have noticed you.|
31129|It looked this way, but didn't seem to see you at all.|
31130|Those are Ferocious Eclipse Rabbit guards. Don't go near them, or you'll definitely be caught.|
31131|I'll cast a guide spell - you can find the Moonlight Rice Cake if you follow the patches of light.|
31132|I'll wait for you at the other end of the cavern. Let's meet after you're done collecting Rice Cakes.|
31133|You hear noises ahead - a group of Moonlight Rabbits fleeing in panic.|
31134|You see a fat Eclipse Rabbit about to flatten the Moonlight Rabbits.|
31135|Quickly, defeat the Fat Eclipse Rabbit!|
31136|Thank you! We'd be goners if you hadn't helped us.|
31137|But...who are you exactly?|
31138|You explain the whole story, slowly, like you're talking to a five-year old.|
31139|So, you're here to take back the Rice Cakes? That's great!|
31140|I heard the Fat Eclipse Rabbit stored some of the Moonlight Rice Cakes in the big urn at the forked road. Go and take a look.|
31141|You see that the Eclipse Rabbits ahead seem to be holding a grand celebration.|
31142|They seem completely immersed in their celebration, dancing as though entranced.|
31143|You realize that some of them are glowing with golden light! Looks like they've got the Rice Cakes.|
31144|Use the Moonlight Mallet to deal a fatal blow to the glowing Eclipse Rabbits.|
31145|Just as you heave a sigh of relief, you see Luna waving at you from the underbrush.|
31146|Quick, go and see what she wants.|
31147|Just as Luna is about to speak, an earsplitting noise rings out.|
31148|Eclipse Rabbit King: "I can smell the stench of these INTRUUUDERS. Quickly, capture them!"|
31149|Eclipse Rabbit King: "Come, capture them quickly!"|
31150|You see huge numbers of Eclipse Rabbits charging at you. Defeat them all!|
31151|Eclipse Rabbit King: "Looks like you're not complete scrubs. I'll take care of you myself!"|
31152|Defeat the Eclipse Rabbit King!|
31153|Following the fall of the Eclipse Rabbit King, peace returned to the cavern.|
31154|Quickly, give Luna the Rice Cakes you've collected.|
31155|Talk to Luna first, then continue moving forward.|
31156|What you did has startled the Eclipse Rabbits - they started to cry out.|
31157|Eclipse Rabbit: "There's an intruder! Quickly everyone, catch it!"|
31158|Whining sounds drift from round the corner. Go take a look.|
31159|The foreman's loud scream catch the attention of many Guards.|
31160|Keep going deep within to look for others being oppressed.|
31161|Stop the sinister Dwarf and his robots from trying to conquer the world!|
31162|Intruder alert! Intruder alert! Deploy all personnel!|
31163|There are still people waiting to be rescued. Go back and save them first!|
31164|You managed to save everyone - now head deeper and destroy the sinister Dwarf's giant robot!|
31165|Rohm and his Robots have been defeated. After you shut down the Factory, you prepare to leave...|
31166|At the exit are people preparing to leave, and women who are looking for villagers.|
31167|A woman runs inside hurriedly.|
31168|There seems to be something moving behind the pile of boxes.|
31169|There's a child hiding in the box!|
31170|Defeat the foreman and save the people from their suffering!|

31188|The Black Mist here is making folks feel uneasy. Let's head back and talk to White Beard first.|
31189|A strange-looking creature is calling to you. Go and see what it wants.|
31190|The Guardian Spirit Floret rushed to the side, leaving a string of Lights on the ground.|
31191|Please follow the lights, and move forward.|
31192|Floret: Here it is! This is the Spirit Torch! Come, quick!|
31193|You ignite the Spirit Torch.|
31194|The Spirit Torch blazes with a dazzling golden light that burns back the black mist.|
31195|Help Floret defeat it!|
31196|Daq: Hah! I'll make you as huge as I am. Then let's see if you're so quick to bite me!|
31197|Villagers who were transformed into monsters have returned to normal.|
31198|Floret has too.|
31199|Follow the lights Floret left on the ground, and keep onward.|
31200|Floret: This is the second Spirit Torch! Ignite it now!|
31201|Continue to follow the lights Floret left on the ground and move ahead.|
31202|Defeat Daq and his Dark Servants.|
31203|The Black Mist obscuring the Spirit Torch has now dissipated. Ignite it!|
31204|Under the dazzling golden light,  the black mist and the phantoms vanished.|
31205|Suddenly, Floret is transformed into a bug!|
31206|Daq: How could I just let you transform back to your original form? Heh heh.|
31207|Daq: Floret, you just keep on bugging me, so really, this form suits you best!|
31208|Daq's real self must be hidden on the Altar.|
31209|Follow Floret's instructions and defeat it!|
31210|Daq: Humph! You think you can change back to normal if you defeat me?|
31211|The dark mist gathers, coalescing into a being.|
31212|Daq launches a fierce attack!|
31213|You sense, almost instinctively, that a great threat lies ahead.|
31214|Heading back to White Beard to analyze the situation seems like a good idea.|
31215|The Village Chief and the villagers hurriedly rush over.|
31216|It seems like they've all changed back to their original forms.|
31217|Quickly, light it!|
31218|Be careful! Something seems to be lurking in the dark.|
32001|It might be threatening, but not really dangerous. Continue onward and find the treasure!|
32002|Security is quite tight here. I'll bet the treasure's not far!|
32003|Help Eddie out of his predicament!|
32004|You hear the faint sound of battle in the distance...|
32005|An evil aura emanating from the Crystal Ore stops you in your tracks.|
32006|Damn, the sneak-attack failed!|
32007|Surely you've heard of me, peeps - Eddie the Exorcist, demon destroyer extraordinaire!|
32008|Defeat the Crystal Shadow that has appeared.|
32009|Whoa-ho-ho! Did you see that? That's my TRUE STRENGTH, muchachos.|
32010|You're probably all excited to see me in action, I know, so let's go!|
32011|I can feel the Crystal Shadow's presence, like the lingering stench of a musty fart. Keep on your guard!|
32012|Yeah yeah. Piece of cake, yo.|
32013|Help Eddie eradicate the evil Crystal Shadow in the Mine.|
32014|I'm glad you've come. It saves me the trouble of hunting you down!|
32015|You humans are actually pretty good. Who knew?|
32016|If you have the guts to show your face, you ought to be prepared for death!|
32017|Where are you running?!|
32018|Don't just stand there slack-jawed! You came here to eradicate the Crystal Shadow, right?|
32019|I guess I'll have to take you on as my loyal sidekick. C'mon, sidekick!|
32020|......|
32021|Mwahaha... If we pop up in front of Callisto again, what do you think he'll say?|
32022|I'll let you in on a little secret. I haven't even been using my FULL POWER.|
32023|What a trifling attack! You're not nearly good enough!|
32024|Indeed, I don't normally talk this much. I'm just trying to soothe your nerves. I hope you appreciate the effort.|
32025|Hmmph! You think you can trap me like that?|
32026|Hee...|
32027|The evil aura before you hasn't dissipated. You can't easily pass through.|
32028|Let's go. This time, we'll bust up Callisto for sure!|
32029|Don't ask me where I got this staff. It's a MYSTIC SECRET.|
32030|Hah! Mere child's play.|
32031|If it was me, I'd definitely set an ambush on that bridge. Too bad they're too dumb to think of that, haha!|
32032|... Die!|
32033|Ah! My Dark Flare Crystal Ore...No!|
32034|See, I told you it was just a trap!|
32035|Mmm... After walking this long, my knees are...|
32036|Hmph, that despicable Callisto is still sending minions to try and wear me down.|
32037|Even if the staff's magical might has been exhausted, I'll fight to the very end!|
32038|Alright, it's your time to shine... Terminate Callisto at all costs!|
32039|Stand in for Eddie and eliminate Callisto, the Crystal Shadow Lord.|
32040|Exterminate Crystal Shadow Lord Callisto.|
32041|Callisto will send out powerful shockwaves to the surrounding crystals.|
32042|Watch carefully and dodge these shockwaves!|
32043|The Dragons in front keep attacking. Help the soldiers resist their attacks!|
32044|Kill the ferocious Triceragon on the front lines!|
32045|Searing flames are blocking the way forward.|
32046|The situation looks grim. Keep going as quickly as you can!|
32047|Get rid of the Bloodthirsty Triceragons!|
32048|Head up to the highlands and save the Captain!|
32049|Please! You must help the Captain!|
32050|There are Triceragons causing mayhem all over the place! We've lost several soldiers already.|
32051|We have to hold the line!|
32052|I'm sorry Captain, I tried my best...|
32053|A Bloodthirsty Triceragon noticed your presence and is charging straight toward you!|
32054|Eliminate the Violent Ticeragons.|
32055|Eliminate the Bloodthirsty Triceragons.|
32056|Head up to the highlands and save the Captain!|
32057|The Captain is safe, right?|
32058|The Captain would be proud! We've taken down a big one!|
32059|Why do the Triceragons keep attacking the village?|
32060|You need to get rid of the Bloodthirsty Triceragons before you can deal with the barricade up ahead.|
32061|The howling of dozens of Triceragons echoes all around.|
32062|When Arlo's HP drops below half, he will summon a Triceragon Egg and sacrifice it to regain health.|
32063|Destroy the Triceragon Egg before Arlo can absorb it, otherwise he'll recover a huge amount of HP!|
32064|You hear the patter of hurried footsteps all around.|
32065|Destroy the Triceragon Nest|
32066|Quick! You must get out of the Abandoned Mine right away!|
32067|Heeeey! You totally laid the smackdown on Callisto! With my solid-gold help, of course.|
32068|Captain... save him...|
32069|Oh, what's that...pungent smell? Get away from me!|
32070|Don't you dare bring that flower anywhere near me, you hear?|
32071|Go away!|
32072|Sneak by while the Wild Wolf is distracted by pollen.|
32073|Dad, don't leave Annie!|
32074|Lucy: "Keep pushing forward! I believe Robin is waiting for us."|
32075|The howling of wolves continues all around, sending shivers down your spine.|
32076|Defeat Sadlei and rescue Robin.|
32077|The clear sounds of flowing water seemed to call out, beckoning you closer.|
32078|Showering in the Spring of Hope fills you with vigor and energy.|
32079|Showering in the Spring of Eternity surrounds you with comfort and relaxation!|
32080|Lucy: "Mmm? There seem to be something moving behind us."|
32081|Lucy: "What!? Why is it you, Robin? How could this have happened?"|
32082|It seems Sadlei used black magic to transform Robin.|
32083|After Lucy administered aid, Robin stood up, almost as if a man reborn.|
32084|Looks like Sadlei's subordinates have been dealt with - move ahead with Lucy.|
32085|Hahahaha! How does it feel, striking down your beloved by your own hand?|
32086|After defeating Sadlei, you noticed he was carrying a potion. Could this be an antidote?|
32087|Lucy: "Careful, it's an ambush! Watch out for those two werewolves!"|
32088|Lucy: "Watch your surroundings! It's another ambush!"|
32089|Lucy: "Go on and take the Spring Water Bath."|
32090|Help Lucy defeat the Werewolves first.|
32091|Take out the Werewolf and Wolfdog first.|
32092|Lucy caught up - keep moving ahead with her.|
32093|Help Lucy deal with the Werewolf as fast as you can!|
32094|First, check with Sylvia about the current situation.|
32095|There seems to be some commotion up front - go hear what they have to say.|
32096|Defeat Hermano Ladron, then keep going forward.|
32097|Venture deeper and defeat Cult Leader Dabo to rescue Ganara.|
32098|First, borrow the Cultist ID from Sylvia by the entrance, and then talk to the Ticket Checker and enter.|
32099|Sinister Cult Bouncer: "You think you can get in without your Cultist ID? Get outta here!"|
32100|Ganara ran over, pursued by the cultists.|
32101|Cultist: "Once Hermano has finished his questioning, you can pass - not before!"|
32102|Defeat Hermano first, then continue onward.|
32103|I really want to become the Main Character's Friend! Let's go!|
32104|Feed the Tanuki at the door to get started!|
32105|Only 1 minute remaining!|
32106|Please give the Steak to the 5 monsters at the end of the corridor within 2 minutes!|
32107|It turns out that being the Main Character's Friend isn't all that fun...|
32108|Defeat the Treasure Chest to obtain gifts! Hurry up!|
32109|Knock down the big house using only one skill within in 5 minutes.|
32110|With Vachnam's sacrifice, Aveline was finally able to defeat Tavana!|
32111|She gently says something gently to the crushed gravel that was once Vachnam.|
32112|Tears stream down Aveline's face.|
32113|One of her teardrops falls onto the remains of Vachnam.|
32114|The gravel, wet with tears, seems to respond to Aveline, as it starts to emit beams of bright light.|
32115|The light disappears all of a sudden.|
32116|Aveline travels across the continent, searching for energy crystals or energy stones.|
32117|Aveline travels to all parts of the continent without resting, and collects quite a few crystals.|
32118|Aveline brings these crystals with her as she arrives in an unusual realm.|
32119|She puts down some of the crystals in the middle of this realm, and then recites an incantation.|
32120|The surrounding crystals seem to respond to the spell as energy starts to gather.|
32121|The smoke dissipates, and a Stone Golem appears in front of Aveline.|
32122|Aveline attacks the Stone Golem after finishing her sentence, and the Stone Golem turns into a stone.|
32123|Just then, Aveline feels the trembling caused by the energy.|
32124|Aveline runs towards the center of the energy.|
32125|A floating crystal is emitting the energy.|
32126|The crystal seems to sense Aveline's presence as she approaches it.|
32127|Aveline places Vachnam's remains below the crystal, and then the rest of her crystals.|
32128|Aveline recites an incantation, and the energy seems to respond to it as starts to gather.|
32129|Just as Aveline finishes casting the spell, a powerful beam of light strikes her in the heart.|
32130|???: "Let me see your dreams."|
32131|Aveline falls asleep, and the lights slowly start to extract her dream.|
32132|The crystal continues to shine as Aveline appears before everyone in the dream.|
32133|The crystal shines once more, and shows an image of a couple having a picnic.|
32134|Margaret speaks and leaves afterwards, leaving Hank to figure things out by himself.|
32135|As Hank runs towards Margaret, the image becomes blurry.|
32136|Aveline's memory slowly turns into beams of light, which gather around the crystal.|
32137|The crystal takes in the memories while emitting a pale yellow light, and then travels to the source of the voice.|
32138|A scarecrow form is drawn in the air, and in the next moment a real scarecrow appears from the portal.|
32139|The scarecrow then passes through the gate.|
32140|Just as the gate disappears, Aveline slowly wakes up.|
32141|Aveline becomes restless and stands up as she tries to find Hank, but all she can find are scattered pieces.|
32142|Aveline smiles sadly as she looks at these pieces.|
32143|More Stone Golems appear as the previous Stone Golems have been defeated.|
32144|The Stone Golems look at Aveline with much animosity.|
32145|???: "Come here."|
32146|In a quiet, shady corner, a female Hornwolf looks lovingly at her sleeping baby.|
32147|(My dear Little Fenrir, mama will protect you.)|
32148|The expedition team is making some noise nearby.|
32149|(Mama has to leave you now. Stay strong, my love)|
32150|Agnes uses branches and leaves to cover Fenrir.|
32151|Agnes takes one last, longing look at her child, then runs out defiantly towards the direction of the voice.|
32152|A female Hornwolf appears in front of the expedition team.|
32153|The team has subdued Agnes. With several members of the team pinning her down, one of the members quietly walks towards her with a menacing, haunting look.|
32154|He gently recites an incantation to tie up his captive.|
32155|With Agnes now unable to move, the team ties her up and stuffs her into a sack.|
32156|The expedition team members can be seen pottering around the camp.|
32157|Fenrir quietly tries to get closer to the large bubbling cauldron without being noticed.|
32158|Oh no! He's caught their attention. Fenrir is quickly surrounded by a group of men, bristling with weapons.|
32159|After a quick battle, Fenrir is pinned down by the team.|
32160|Fenrir recharges, trying to transform once more.|
32161|???: "You want to recharge, do you? Why don't you pass some of that energy to me?"|
32162|From above, a crystal appears, shining with a intense light.|
32163|Once the light fades, everyone including Fenrir is asleep.|
32164|The scarecrow waves, and Fenrir disappears.|
32165|The scarecrow waves again, and this time a portal appears.|
32166|After the scarecrow and the portal disappear, the expedition team members gradually wake up.|
32167|The still-groggy expedition team clears its things and moves on, the sack still in tow.|
32168|The scene shifts to a forest.|
32169|The scarecrow waves, and Fenrir slowly floats down onto the forest floor.|
32170|The scarecrow waves again, and this time a portal appears.|
32171|The scarecrow speaks and then disappears through the portal, which closes up in a flash behind him.|
32172|Realizing that the humans who had caught him are gone, Fenrir looks puzzled.|
32173|Soon, Fenrir appears to have gotten over his puzzlement, but now he is ravenously hungry.|
32174|Fenrir, now famished, smells food and takes off in the direction of the scent.|
32175|Torian puts down his food and goes to the creek nearby to wash his hands.|
32176|Fenrir sneaks up quietly, picks up the food and quickly leaves.|
32177|Torian begins looking for the thief who took his dinner. He finds several footprints in the surrounding area and studies them intently.|
32178|The image seems less clear now...|
32179|The expedition team continues its journey through the forest.|
32180|In the middle of Helheim, Hel is talking to a sword.|
32181|Jormungand, standing besides her, seems full of sadness for his sister.|
32182|Jormungand has come all the way to the inner region of Helheim.|
32183|He slowly walks towards the center. As he walks approaches, bookshelves begin to appear, seemingly out of thin air.|
32184|Jormungand walks to the bookshelf in the center.|
32185|He picks up a book, flips through it, and then slowly begins chanting an incantation written on one of the pages.|
32186|As Jormungand recites the incantation, Gram's Phantoms start to take shape around him.|
32187|The incantation is complete. One of the Phantoms slowly moves in a swirling haze towards a dark corner.|
32188|The spell summons a flood of phantoms and Shadow Guards.|
32189|Jormungand continues to gather and guide these phantoms into defensive positions to protect him from the impending Shadow Guards' attack.|
32190|As the phantoms gather, the figure of Gram's begins to take shape in an ethereal glow.|
32191|A sudden beam of light appears. A holographic form in the shape of Gram has appeared in front of Jormungand.|
32192|Jormungand and the shape converse for a spell. At the end of the discussion, Jormungand quickly turns and leaves the room.|
32193|Gram keeps quiet for a moment, as if considering his options. Finally, he decides to follow Jormungand.|
32194|Now Jormungand is back in the center of Helheim, with Gram by his side.|
32195|Hel runs towards Gram as in disbelief.|
32196|Jormungand suddenly spots a long sword on the bookshelf.|
32197|Hel's sadness causes a great cloud of dark energy to form.|
32198|The dark energy continues to build in intensity, increasing Hel's grief exponentially. Finally, she loses all sanity, and with it, any semblance of humanity.|
32199|Hel, in her outpouring of anger and terror, destroys nearly half of Helheim. She then collapses from exhaustion.|
32200|The following scene is inside Hel's chambers.|
32201|Gram is quietly looking down at the sleeping Hel.|
32202|Gram is puzzled to hear Hel talking in her sleep.|
32203|???: "Well, let me help you!"|
32204|Scheel does not reply, but he waves.|
32205|Hel's dream appears in front of Scheel and Gram.|
32206|Observing Hel, who seems to be dreaming uneasily, Gram looks unusually sad.|
32207|Scheel waves, and a mysterious crystal appears above Gram.|
32208|The crystal emits beams of black light, sucking in the phantom.|
32209|After absorbing the phantom, the crystal slowly reveals its secret character.|
32210|Scheel waves again. This time, Gram appears inside Hel's dream.|
32211|After the dream ends, Hel slowly comes to.|
32212|Under the effects of the Power of Gaia, the memories slowly bubble back up to the surface.|
32213|In a suburb far removed from the hubbub of city life, a couple looks at each other with sad expressions.|
32214|The scene shifts... now a grand house appears.|
32215|In front of the house, a man is seen desperately beseeching an elderly person.|
32216|At this moment, Ethel rushes from inside the house to Scheel's side.|
32217|The old man feels deep regret as he looks upon his daughter beseeching him.|
32218|Soon afterwards, Scheel is off on a treasure hunting expedition.|
32219|After a difficult journey, Scheel finally arrives in the legendary realm.|
32220|Four treasure chests appear in front of Scheel.|
32221|As Scheel attempts to move closer, he touches the seal on one of the chests.|
32222|The chest shines, and the Evil Spirits that once died here now reappear!|
32223|Using all his strength, Scheel finally breaks the seal on the treasure chest.|
32224|With the seal broken, the Evil Spirits surrounding Scheel disappear.|
32225|Scheel cannot believe what he has seen in the treasure chest.|
32226|He immediately picks up as much treasure as he can carry, and starts to make his way back home.|
32227|The scene shifts once more to the front of the grand house.|
32228|Scheel places the treasure at the Archduke's feet.|
32229|Having heard rumors that the Archduke might renege on his promises, Ethel screams out a warning to stop the transaction.|
32230|Soon after, Scheel and Ethel are married. They live happily ever after.|
32231|Suddenly, the beautiful image is cut short as a voice is heard.|
32232|???: "Who's that? It's very impolite to trespass in a person's memories."|
32233|Scheel: "There's a price to pay if you peek in the memories of others..."|
32234|A cloud of Reaper Energy freezes the whole space, and Scheel slowly appears.|
32235|The Reaper Energy which was holding the whole place in stasis suddenly dissipates.|
32236|Scheel: "Heh! I'd say that's probably enough of a price. I've had enough of all of you..."|
32237|After finishing his speech, Scheel quickly traces a line in the air and a portal appears.|
32238|Scheel: "I'll be seeing you... just wait..."|
32239|As Scheel takes his leave, the remaining memories begin to display once more.|
32240|The reaper appears in front of Scheel.|
32241|It swings its scythe menacingly, plucking Ethel's spirit away.|
32242|The reaper raises its weapon once more, and a box appears at Scheel's feet.|
32243|Scheel opens the box without any hesitation.|
32244|A thick fog of Reaper Energy slowly rises from the box, enveloping Scheel.|
32245|The thick fog dissipates. When Scheel reappears from the cloud, he looks like the reaper himself.|
32246|The reaper gently waves, gently beckoning away Ethel's spirit.|
32247|The reaper leaves after saying his words.|
32248|Tears begin to stream down Scheel's face, a face now hauntingly stuck in the twisted grimace of the reaper.|
32249|The remaining memories stop here.|
32250|The Mirror Orb shines again, and a portal suddenly appears in mid air.|
32251|???: "Heh! My dear friends, I'm back!"|
32252|???: "Yes, as promised. I. Am. Back."|
32253|Scheel: "Do you want the secret treasure chest? Alright then. Just give me a bit more of your Power of Gaia."|
32254|Scheel's phantom flickers into focus as soon as he finishes speaking.|
32255|Scheel: "Ah! Okay. That's enough. I will return the secret treasure chest to you."|
32256|Scheel: "See you next time, my dear Envoys of Gaia."|
32257|Sensing people nearby, the Mirror Orb begins to glow.|
32258|A palace from the Eternal Night frontier slowly fades into view in front of you.|
32259|Seated in the center of the hall, Thanatos admires the Light Orbs floating around him.|
32260|A man with a striking resemblance to the Reaper appears in the hall.|
32261|As he enters the palace, the Light Orbs instantly disappear.|
32262|As Thanatos is about to leave the palace, he has a sudden thought and turns to look at Hypnos.|
32263|After he speaks, Thanatos enters the Portal and leaves.|
32264|In front of the chair, a floating sphere sparkles with radiant light, attracting Hypnos' gaze.|
32265|Hypnos approaches the floating Light Orb, and, forgetting Thanatos' warning, reaches out to touch it.|
32266|The orb suddenly emits a bright light, making Hypnos cry out in shock.|
32267|The Light Orb seems to respond and the souls collected within begin to appear one after the other.|
32268|Hardly has his voice faded when wandering souls emerge in front of everyone.|
32269|The Mirror Orb once again emits a blinking light and phantoms of Thanatos and Hypnos appear.|
32270|After accepting the souls, Thanatos looks on helplessly at the chaotic palace and heaves a heavy sigh.|
32271|Thanatos waves his hand and a number of Light Orbs instantly appear around him.|
32272|The light orbs emit a faint light that appears to attract the wandering souls.|
32273|Thanatos, no longer paying any attention to Hypnos, turns to inspect the orbs.|
32274|The scene gradually becomes blurry.|
32275|Sparked into life by the Power of Gaia, the Mirror Orb emits a dazzling light.|
32276|A soul resembling Ethel floats within space and time.|
32277|Following the direction of the soul's gaze, light orbs gradually appear, forming a path.|
32278|At the end of the light path you see a warehouse filled with dolls.|
32279|Ethel's soul passes through the closed gate and approaches an exquisitely crafted doll.|
32280|Ethel's soul gradually transforms into a light that illuminates the entire warehouse before attaching itself to the doll.|
32281|Lulu's eyes gradually come to life and she stands up.|
32282|But at the same time, she discovers that the nearby dolls, influenced by the Puppet Hearts, are also gradually awakening.|
32283|They slowly approach Lulu...|
32284|The phantom then gradually transforms into a material body.|
32285|The Mirror Orb once again emits a radiant light. Shattered dolls appear all around.|
32286|After a short while, only Lulu remains intact.|
32287|The sound of hurried footsteps can be heard coming from outside, and Lulu can only pretend she's become an ordinary doll.|
32288|A terrified merchant comes running into the warehouse.|
32289|Out of the corner of his eye, the merchant catches sight of the Lulu Doll.|
32290|The merchant hurriedly stuffs the remaining dolls into a bag.|
32291|When the bag is full, the merchant heads off in the direction of the market.|
32292|The memories for this floor stop here...|
32293|Affected by the Power of Gaia, the Mirror Orb emits a blinding light.|
32294|With phantoms coming and going in the market, a doll merchant is busy selling his wares.|
32295|The scene changes to a businessman returning home, carrying a gift.|
32296|He approaches a girl lying on her sickbed and takes out the gift.|
32297|After saying something, the businessman leaves at once, paying no heed to the look of disappointment on Vicki's face.|
32298|Vicki holds the doll she has just received tightly to her face, and buries her face in it.|
32299|Tears of sadness begin to flow, falling on the doll's face.|
32300|The businessman never came back to see Vicki.|
32301|Darkness falls and Lulu Doll quietly approaches her brother's bed.|
32302|As she approaches her brother she happens upon the businessman's wife.|
32303|In an instant, Lulu Doll's material form appears.|
32304|The Mirror Orb once again emits light, causing the apparitions to reappear.|
32305|Lulu is captured by the crowd. In the center of the village they prepare to burn her to death.|
32306|Vicki charges in, but the businessman blocks her path, preventing her from approaching Lulu.|
32307|Vicki faints in front of the businessman.|
32308|(Really? It's because of me? Vicki won't get any better...)|
32309|(But if I were to disappear, then Vicki would get better, right?)|
32310|At that moment, time and space condense, and a portal appears.|
32311|Scheel notices the doll on the fire rack and is filled with a feeling he can't describe.|
32312|Scheel waves and steps forward to save the doll.|
32313|Scheel waves once more, erasing everyone's memory of him.|
32314|Scheel enters the portal with the doll.|
32315|When the portal disappears, Death's Call is immediately removed from the space.|
32316|The record of the Mirror Orb stops there...|
32317|The Mirror Orb slowly emits rays of light and the phantoms stored in the orbs begin to appear.|
32318|It is in this way that Lulu and Scheel come to live together.|
32319|But, now living a peaceful life, Lulu would often wonder about Vicki.|
32320|(Vicki, I wonder if your health's improved? I wish we could play together...)|
32321|(If only I could see her again...)|
32322|After Scheel has left, Lulu gazes blankly at the idle portal, when suddenly she has an idea.|
32323|Excited, Lulu hurries over to the portal.|
32324|The aura inside the portal is heavy and Lulu can't help but screw her eyes shut.|
32325|When she opens her eyes once more, Lulu finds herself in an unfamiliar suburb.|
32326|Not far away, the sound of sobbing can be heard.|
32327|The villagers are surrounding a box and crying, preparing to bury it.|
32328|Lulu senses what's going on and a dark aura descends on her.|
32329|When the aura disperses, you're shocked to see a demonized Lulu.|
32330|The orb once again emits rays of light, projecting images of dormant memories.|
32331|Lulu is taken back to the village and bound so she can't move.|
32332|The air condenses and a portal materializes from nowhere.|
32333|???: "Stop!"|
32334|The record of the Mirror Orb stops there...|
32335|The Mirror Orb suddenly emits a blinding light and the memories stored there gradually begin to manifest.|
32336|Shackled by Death's Call, the villagers can barely speak.|
32337|In a flash, Scheel's phantom takes on its material form and appears.|
32338|The Mirror Orb again emits its rays of light and the stored memories are replayed.|
32339|Unwilling to harm the villagers to protect Lulu, he can only try to withstand the villagers' attack.|
32340|Scheel dispatches all of the guards.|
32341|The villagers, seeing that Scheel is not resisting, quickly tie him up together with Lulu.|
32342|The blaze spreads, and a raging inferno fills the sky.|
32343|Before long, the doll and the scarecrow are burnt to a cinder.|
32344|Once the smoke clears, the villagers all begin to leave the center of the village.|
32345|A hand slowly appears, and then a foot...|
32346|finally, Scheel re-emerges from the ashes.|
32347|???: "There you are!"|
32348|Thanatos pokes the remaining ashes and a few of Ethel's souls appear.|
32349|Thanatos, pleased with himself at getting back the souls so easily, takes them and leaves.|
32350|Scheel once again cries silent tears, and turning around, he opens the portal and leaves.|
32351|Peace is restored to the village once more, almost as if nothing had happened there at all.|
32352|Vicki: "Please don't bully my friend! Boo hoo hoo..."|
32353|Vicki has charged into the room to protect her friend.|
32354|Hurry and put on the ghost costume to scare her!|
32355|Vicki: "Boohoo, I hate ghosts..."|
32356|Change into the ghost costume to scare Vicki.|
32357|placeholder_32357|
33001|Defeat the guards in front protecting the wild boars!|
33002|The wild boars have already been released. A Sprout is diverting them away.|
33003|The Sprout will take care of things here - keep on going.|
33004|The Grass Kingdom Elder is waiting for you in front.|
33005|The Grass Kingdom Elder sent Sprouts to sneak into the Village first.|
33006|Let's hit the road! The Princess is depending on you to rescue her!|
33007|After the wild boars left, you found Moe unconscious!|
33008|You find the unfortunate Rehia in a huge mound of poo to the side!|
33009|You hear the sound of battle up ahead. As you draw closer, you hear screams...|
33010|You heard numerous Trolls roaring up ahead.|
33011|The Trolls are furious about the runaway wild boars!|
33012|The Trolls have found you, and they're running toward you!|
33013|Rehia casts Furious Rage on the wild boars, making them bigger and stronger!|
33014|The King of Gluttony has appeared, turning the wild boars into slabs of ham with a single strike!|
33015|You defeated the King of Gluttony in time and rescued the Princess.|
33016|Some wild boars have not been released yet. Search for them in the village.|
33017|Awaiting you is the Grass Kingdom's Eternal Elder, Yeshe.|
33018|The Eternal Elder incants a powerful spell that will allow you to enter the nightmares of his people.|
33019|The gate to the dreamworld is open. Hurry and enter!|
33020|Yeshe has placed a powerful aura around you that will protect you from the effects of the nightmares.|
33021|The aura protecting you from the nightmares has dissipated...|
33022|You find yourself inside of Cole's nightmare.|
33023|Cole is trapped in a nightmare of the time she was attacked by a Troll and several Mudlings.|
33024|The Troll is calling out more and more Mudlings. Defeat it and rescue Cole!|
33025|You've freed Cole from her torturous nightmares. The surroundings begin to swirl as you're pulled into another nightmare...|
33026|You find yourself inside of Rehia's nightmare.|
33027|Rehia is dreaming of when his tryst with the Sealand Princess turned sour.|
33028|Help Rehia escape by stopping the Sealand soldiers pursuing him.|
33029|You've freed Rehia from his torturous nightmares. The surroundings begin to swirl as you're absorbed into someone else's nightmare...|
33030|You find yourself inside of Moe's nightmare.|
33031|Moe is surrounded by the insects he's most afraid of.|
33032|Help Moe overcome his fear by destroying the bugs!|
33033|You've freed Moe from his torturous nightmares. The surroundings begin to swirl as you're transported to someone else's nightmare...|
33034|Only Zinnia remains.|
33035|Something is wrong. You don't seem to be in the dream of anyone you recognize.|
33036|Ah! So you're the one messing with my dreamworld!|
33037|So, you want to save this Sprout? Hah! Keep on dreaming!|
33038|I'll show you just how powerful this nightmare is!|
33039|King of the Dream Eaters: No! How is this possible?|
33040|As the nightmare dissolves, you find yourself back in reality.|
33041|Zibo: Barlo! I'll never forget this!|
33042|Zibo: Next time, you're dead!|
33043|This place seems to have a very high energy density.|
33044|A lady dressed in white stands silently before the tablet. What is she doing?|
33045|In the depths of the Mineral Lake, the energy's density grows even greater.|
33046|Suddenly, you feel the energy rushing towards you, and it makes you feel giddy.|
33047|Your vision blurs, and you begin to lose consciousness.|
33048|When you come to, you have no idea where you are.|
33049|Looking around in panic, you see a lady dressed all in white.|
33050|She walks slowly towards the tablet.|
33051|Then, turning towards you, she bows.|
33052|Confused, you call out to her, but realize that you have no voice.|
33053|Your vision blurs once again.|
33054|As it returns, you realize that you are still at the Lake.|
33055|It is as if everything you saw just a moment ago had never happened.|
33056|At this point, you are no longer sure what's real and what isn't.|
33057|You decide the best thing to do is to find Cambel and tell her about all of it.|
33058|This is the Mineral Lake zone. You stop for a while to take in the surroundings.|
33059|Mia inspects the tablet, and casts a spell to see if it will react.|
33060|Divine Power spreads everywhere as a beam of holy light descends, covering the entire tablet.|
33061|You sense a wave of golden warmth wash over you as the evil energy begins to recede from the tablet. It should be fully purified soon.|
33062|Suddenly, the ground shakes as a roar sounds from afar.|
33063|You feel a huge flow of evil energy swirling and gathering force.|
33064|A horde of demons is on their way to this place. They must be annihilated so that they do not disturb Mia before the spell is complete.|
33065|With no warning, Isai is suddenly enveloped in a cloud of black vapor.|
33066|Isai emits a powerful shockwave of energy that kills all the demons in the area.|
33067|The holy light dissipates. It seems that the purification ritual is complete.|
33068|Mia turns towards the tablet and mutters an incantation.|
33069|A crystal-clear pearl is pushed out from the tablet.|
33070|The pearl slowly floats towards Mia, who carefully takes it in her hand.|
33071|The silhouettes of Mia and Isai are visible, sprinting in your direction.|
33072|Mia concentrates as she casts her purification spell.|
33073|The demons continue to pour in en masse. They show no sign of slowing.|
33074|Maya and Isai are both engaged in the thick of battle, as more and more demons join the fray.|
33075|Isai winces, a great pain washing over his body.|
33076|Another horde of demons circles around from the back, trying to surround Mia.|
33077|Isai and Maya are completely pinned down by a mass of demons. You can't leave Mia behind. You must go protect her.|
33078|Mia is under attack by the demon horde. Quickly, go help her!|
33079|Everyone decides to heed your advice and leave before the demons can mount another attack.|
33080|Isai wears a resigned, yet peaceful expression as he collapses. He seems to know that he has used up all his power.|
33081|Mia recites the incantation on the tablet once again.|
33082|You can feel the evil energy wafting over from the throngs of demons. You steel yourself, knowing they may attack at any time.|
33083|You aren't safe here. You shout out a warning -- you must hurry up and leave before the demons attack.|
33084|Even though the demons have been eliminated, you still feel anxious. You decide to check the area.|
33085|You nod a greeting to Mia and Isai, who have just arrived.|
33086|You give your word to Mia that you will protect her.|
33087|Step into the halo on the ground to randomly replace a skill.|

33113|My power is out, I can't keep going!|
33114|You can't leave the halo. Your casting failed.|
33115|My energy will only last for 2 minutes. You've got to get rid of all Skeleton Ghosts before then.|
33116|The ceremony's destroyed by the zombies. Strong energy stopped it.|
33117|One minute has passed! Hurry up!|
33118|Use the Exorcism Talisman to stop the zombies.|
33119|Return the five gems...|
33120|I've guarded these five gems for a long time, why'd you take them?|
33121|Hahahahaha! The seal is finally broken.|
33122|No one can stop me now.|
33123|Give the Exorcist gems to Phantom Mage.|
33124|Take to Phantom Mage to understand what's happening.|
33125|I need someone to stand in the halo with me. Don't leave the halo until the ghosts have been driven away.|
33126|Don't leave the halo! The Skeleton Ghosts have not been fully driven away yet.|
33127|I have to use a Ghost Warding spell to stop the Skeleton Ghosts, before I can finish them off with an exorcism.|
33128|Ahead there are 5 Sorrows, and each of them has 5 gems.|
33129|With their 5 gems I'll be able to seal the haunted house completely.|
33130|They each will give up their gem for one specific item from the box.|
33131|Here's the key for the treasure box...|
33132|I'm going to use the power of the gems to seal the haunted house.|
33133|I'll need your protection during the ceremony. Don't let any ghosts come in and wreck it.|
33134|The mechanism is open. Have a good look around.|
33135|If you cannot unlock the mechanism within 3 minutes,|
33136|Kingdom City's magic will teleport you out...|
33137|Two minutes remaining...|
33138|One minute remaining...|
33139|A real pity. You need to go back and use your brain more.|
33140|You have opened the mechanism! The iron gate in front of you immediately disappears.|
33141|Continue forward to the next stage.|
33142|You have succeeded! Well done!|
33143|I will go up ahead and scope out the situation...|
33144|Watch out for those robots up ahead...|
33145|Step within the red detection area and you'll be captured.|
33146|If 3 people are captured, after 1 minute, Kingdom City's magic will be activated.|
33147|Use the super-strong tool set on the Electric Core to switch modes.|
33148|Close 6 electrical cores, and you'll be able to shut down all of the robots.|
33149|To get through this stage you need to work together.|
33150|You accidentally step into the detection area and are captured by the spy plane.|
33151|Now you cannot move. All you can do is believe in your teammates...|
33152|A real pity. You need to go back and practice more.|
33153|Three people have been captured, and you only have 1 minute left to free the Electric Core...|
33154|After an epic struggle, you finally arrive at Kingdom City's Hall...|
33155|However, Forlan is looking tense...|
33156|??: "You're finally here, Verne..."|
33157|??: You might possess other people's bodies, but I can still sense you.|
33159|The magical power of Kingdom City condenses around Norton...|
33160|and the powerful magic completely distorts his appearance...|
33161|Although you are unsure who on earth this Forlan up ahead is...|
33162|please help him defeat Kingdom City's King Norton...|
33163|Pay attention to Forlan's HP, you cannot let him be defeated.|
33164|Dark magic has prevailed and you are powerless...|
33165|Make good use of the Artillery Batteries, they possess formidable firepower.|
33166|Forlan slowly falls before you...|
33167|When King Norton falls, the magic instantly dissipates...|
33168|The fourth prince, after expressing his gratitude, leaves Forlan's body...|
33169|The magic gradually disappears, and the whole city starts to shake...|
33170|Hurriedly, you follow Forlan and flee Kingdom City...|
33171|Led by Forlan, you finally arrive at the final room...|
33172|The room emits a tantalizing golden glimmer...|
33173|You only have 5 minutes to get your fill of valuables...|
33174|Different treasure chests carry different valuables.|
33175|You are moving too slowly ...Kingdom City is collapsing!|
33176|Hurry up, there are only 3 minutes remaining!|
33177|One minute remaining ...Give it all you've got!|
33178|The top floor exit is open. Hurry and get out of there!|
33179|It's pitch black and the last of the magical power teleports you out...|
33180|Carry the valuables to the top floor exit...|
33181|The top floor exit is open.|
33182|Hurry and get out of there!|
33183|This isn't enough, hurry back and get some more!|
33184|Forlan has been seriously injured. Hurry and treat him!|
33185|An iron gate has opened somewhere in the city...|
33186|Use the corridor! Hurry and tell Mr. Butler the good news!|
33187|See through the bottle's lies. Hurry and tell Mr. Butler the good news!|
33188|Wait a second!|
33189|Placate Ms. Piano!|
33190|Ah, you chose the fake bottle and Mr. Butler asks you to leave...|
33191|Hey, there's not much time! The remaining squirrels rush up and bump into you...|
33192|There's not enough time to calm Ms. Piano down. She is furious with you...|
33193|Castle Master: "Come back when you have practiced your dancing moves, okay?"|
33194|Welcome, welcome! Congratulations on getting this far...|
33195|Come, choose a dance partner... finish with some nice slow dance steps...|
33196|Entertain me!|
33197|Keep dancing...|
33198|Excellent... You're a natural...|
33199|Enjoy the last dance of the day.|
33200|No, no, no! What kind of dancing is that?|
33201|One more time and I'll ask you to leave the floor.|
33202|Ms. Piano: "Humph, you don't think it matters?"|
33203|Ms. Piano: "Humph, I won't tell you again!"|
33204|Ms. Piano: "It's just unforgivable..."|
33205|Use your wisdom and your powers of reasoning to figure out which bottle is okay to drink.|
33206|When the time's up the squirrels will go on the rampage.|
33207|Hurry and use all of your skills to calm the squirrels down...|
33208|If Ms. Piano is angry for too long, she will lose patience and drive people out...|
33209|Hurry and use your skills to calm her temper...|
33210|After choosing a dance partner and stepping onto the dance floor, dance on the colors under your feet...|
33211|Before the colors disappear... You need to achieve at least dance level 8 before you're considered a good dancer.|
33212|Poor Little Turtle is being bullied! Hurry over and help the guy out.|
33213|Use the surrounding Oval Dumplings to distract the other animals.|
33214|After all, it's tough to harass others while eating dumplings.|
33215|Thanks to you, Little Turtle is saved. Time to bring him on home...|
33216|Saruroji is awake! Protect Little Turtle!|
33217|Shake off the apes and monkeys and see Little Turtle to safety. Stay along the road leading home...|
33218|Pass through the gap in the cyclone, and after opening four mechanisms, talk to the center crystal.|
33219|To pacify the Sarpa Princess, toss the ore in your hand to her.|
33220|Pay attention to her status, and use the corresponding skill at the temple.|
33221|"Come closer, my child. I can grant your wish..."|
33222|Yeesh! So ugly!|
33223|You didn't manage to distract the animals in time...|
33224|Poor Little Turtle has suffered their wrath...|
33225|You didn't manage to open all of the mechanisms in time...|
33226|Everyone has met their end as a ceremonial vessel to the Sea Lord...|
33227|The Sarpa Princess angrily kicks you out of the Ocean Palace...|
33228|You have a hazy recollection of being made sacrifice before everything went black...|
33229|After a violent shaking, the stale, sulphury smell of the ocean assaults your nostrils...|
33230|You have successfully used the four mechanisms. Hurry and talk with the crystal.|
33231|Affected by the mechanism, you find yourself temporarily unable to move.|
34001|You sense an evil aura ahead. Act quickly and find out what happened!|
34002|The Demon Captain seems to have noticed you!|
34003|Defeat the Demon attacking you!|
34004|To find out what happened, ask Watson, an injured, former Knight of the Light.|
34005|Two residents of the wasteland stand before you.|
34006|Use Holy Power to find out if any demons have snuck in!|
34007|Continue ahead and mingle with the wasteland's residents.|
34008|There seems to be a family living not far from here. Pay them a visit.|
34009|A strange look covers the old woman's face, beads of perspiration gathered on her forehead.|
34010|The Holy Power in your body suddenly begins to surge!|
34011|You see a suspicious-looking villager.|
34012|Follow him to the patch of light and find out what happened.|
34013|Before you realize it, you've been surrounded!|
34014|We've kept you waiting for so long!|
34015|As long as I attend to this matter personally, we have nothing to fear from them!|
34016|Mayin is just ahead! Follow Watson and move toward the patch of light!|
34017|Mayin's demonic minions congeal from the shadows, one after the other.|
34018|Haha, do you feel the grave calling out to you, old man?|
34019|A deep and mysterious voice bellows from the gorge.|
34020|I'm afraid it's you, Mayin, who's on a one-way trip to hell!|
34021|A different voice, higher pitched, matches the first voice word-for-word.|
34022|A mysterious figure appears suddenly, suppressing all the demonic minions with ease.|
34023|Defeat Mayin together with Watson!|
34024|Mayin escaped from the battle with his minions.|
34025|Try talking to this family.|
34026|Just as you were surrounded, you heard Watson calling out.|
34027|Move forward with Holy Radiance, and talk to the residents of the wasteland.|
34028|Please talk to Ali and help him solve his problem.|
34029|Mama Armordillo's vigilance range has grown!|
34030|Follow Doctor Crow, and help him solve the park's problems.|
34031|Talk with Reggie and help him solve his problem.|
34032|Go to the nest and steal the armordillo's egg, carefully avoiding the Mama Armordillo.|
34033|Mama Armordillo appears to have realized that something's amiss.|
34034|Hand the egg to Tilde while still carefully avoiding the Mama Armordillo.|
34035|The Mama Armordillo has spotted you, and is enraged by your suspicious moves!|
34036|For safety's sake, it's better to retreat for now.|
34037|Kurska sniffs the ground, and finding the non-toxic plant.|
34038|Walk to the designated location and place the feed, waiting for the Thieving Rex to appear.|
34039|Continue on to the next site to place the feed.|
34040|You sense something moving around the corner of the cottage in the park district.|
34041|A huge pack of Thieving Rexes has appeared!|
34042|Capture them before they wolf down all the feed!|
34043|The feed's been eaten, and the Thieving Rexes have dispersed.|
34044|Move on to the next district and look for Doctor Crow.|
34045|Shut the Dizzy Thieving Rexes you've just captured into the cage!|
34046|Keep capturing the Dizzy Thieving Rexes before they finish all the feed.|
34047|Talk to Reggie and keep placing bait for the Dizzy Thieving Rexes to capture them.|
34048|Outdoor survival isn't as simple as it might seem.|
34049|The following course will explain everything you need to know in a handy presentation.|
34050|Follow Donna's instructions closely.|
34051|Guide the Ancient Panthera to pass the training exercise.|
34052|Knock down the nearby plants and drink their sweet sap.|
34053|Hunt nearby animals for food.|
34054|Pick medicinal herbs to salve your wounds.|
34055|As the herbs' effect kicks in, you fall into a deep sleep...|
34056|Be careful not to eat poisonous plants.|
34057|Try to defeat the weaker enemies first.|
34058|Speak with Donna and help her solve her problem.|
34059|Kurska tries to challenge the opponent standing before him.|
34060|Continue on to the next district and find Doctor Crow and Principal Hamon.|
34061|Let's take a little jaunt upstream on the river of time.|
34062|A hundred years ago? Hmm...too close.|
34063|Maybe a thousand years ago... No, I need to go further back.|
34064|Ten thousand years ago! Almost there, but I need just a liiiiittle more.|
34065|Here we are, 13,000 years ago... Back when the Giant Mountain Dragon ruled this land.|
34066|Hold off the Giant Mountain Dragon to buy Principal Hamon some time.|
34067|Your fierce offensive temporarily stunned the Giant Mountain Dragon!|
34068|Yeaaahh!|
34069|As Principal Hamon's roar thunders through the hills, several Iron Cages swooped down from the sky.|
34070|In the blink of an eye, the gigantic Iron Cage captured the Giant Mountain Dragon.|
34071|Hmm... Seems like it'd be best not to take too many of these Iron Armordillo Eggs at one time.|
34072|Well, right now might not be the best time to challenge this opponent.|
34073|This opponent looks like he's almost there.|
34074|Preparations are going well! We just need a little more time.|
34075|Preparations are almost complete! Just a bit longer...|
34076|Miner's Ghost: Who's that?! How dare you take my ring...|
34077|Escape Master: Obtained 10 Mirabelle's Blessings!|
34078|Miner's Ghost: Is that you? Give me the ring......|
34079|The ring may be hidden in the depths of the mine. Go see if you can find it!|
34080|This place is about to collapse... We'd better skedaddle before we become permanent occupants!|
34081|Cassidy: Ouch! That smarts!|
34082|Miner's Ghost: Who's that? You dare to take my ring...|
34083|Cassidy: No... no it wasn't me! I don't have it! Stay away from me!|
34084|Miner's Ghost: If I can't find the ring, you will never leave this place!  |
34085|Boy: See? He admitted that he's the Miner's Ghost!|
34086|Boy: I don't think he saw us. Is he just a phantom?|
34087|Boy: I was right!|
34088|Boy: It seems like he won't stop following us... It's a little bit creepy...|
34089|Boy: Hmm... you can defeat that ghost with just one attack, right?|
34090|Boy: I'm familiar with this place! I think we're almost there.|
34091|Stop it! You shout.|
34092|Please go to (785, 791) to charge the Guiding Device.|
34093|When the color of the aura beneath your feet turns the same color as the Barrier, press "Activate Magic Barrier".|
34094|The Magic Barrier has been completely dispelled.|
34095|4 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34096|3 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34097|2 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34098|1 Magic Barriers yet to be dispelled.|
34099|"Rooooaaarr!"|
34100|The Guiding Device's energy reserves are completely charged. Go to the Magic Barrier Switch to remove the barrier.|
34101|The Guiding Device's energy reserves are completely exhausted. Please find the Energy Furnace Guiding Device to recharge it.|
34102|"We have to destroy their ritual! Charge!"|
34103|"Hahahaha!"|
34104|You have been trampled by wild boars, and are stunned.|
34105|Use your torch to thaw the Frostbitten Catseye Sailors.|
34106|You successfully saved a Frostbitten Catseye Sailor.|
34107|You were trampled by wild boars, and the Church Warlocks brought you back to the entrance.|
34108|You have found Frost Crystals!|
34109|You summoned a Mining Robot.|
34110|Nothing found. Try again at another spot.|
34111|Go to (120,560) and use the Portable Drill.|
34112|You have reached your destination - now eliminate the Ghostspinners!|
34113|You have gained "Lively Blessing" for 3 minutes.
Follow the Magic Circles to reach the Ghostspinners.|
34114|Charm Queen: Well well, looks like you decided to show up after all!|
34115|Charm Queen: Unfoooooortunately...|
34116|Charm Queen: You're always one step too late!|
34117|Charm Queen: Why don't you amuse yourself by playing with this?|
34118|Charm Queen: Alas, beset by rabble-rousers once again!|
34119|Charm Queen: Now I'm bored, and you know what that means.|
34120|Charm Queen: You can help me kill some time!|
34121|Charm Queen: Oh! I think I actually broke a sweat back there.|
34122|Charm Queen: I understand you're here to stop me from breaking the seal, no?|
34123|Charm Queen: Well then...catch me if you ca~an!|
34124|Charm Queen: How about...|
34125|Charm Queen: Soon, the seal will be broken.|
34126|Charm Queen: Heehee...|
34127|The winds from the cyclone lash up and down. You realize that the Sky-Dragon King's tremendous energy is beginning to dissipate.|
34128|The energy has dissipated... only the empty Earth Seal remains.|
34129|With a colossal roaring noise, the earth itself pitches and churns.|
34130|In the name of God, release the imprisoned Bisolen!|
34131|Bisolen: I shall harvest the souls of all beings...|
34132|Alex: Look out! Bisolen has been released - get ready to fight!|
34133|After an intense battle, Bisolen lies in a pool of blood. The deep voice begins speaking again...|

34151|The guardian of the ceremony has blocked your path!|
34152|A battle could break out at any moment. Move forward to support Odum and Para!|
34153|The Priest suddenly appears and creates a new barrier around the Energy Furnace Guiding Device!|
34154|After the priest dies, the magic barrier collapses.  |
34155|There's an energy fluctuation similar to that of the wisps in the Haunted Passage.|
34156|The fallen Warlocks' life force has been stored in those devices. Destroy them to interrupt the ritual!|
34157|The device has been damaged. Many of the Warlocks are unable to cast spells!|
34158|The device has been damaged. The flow of energy has been interrupted!|
34159|The device has been completely destroyed. You have successfully halted the ritual!|
34160|The Duke is shielded by a magic barrier, which blocks you from advancing.|
34161|Help Odum stop the ritual!|
34162|The Duke absorbs several of the sorcerers' souls, as the others try to escape.|
34163|Hurry onward and stop the ritual!|
34164|Catch up with Odum!|
34165|Take the Guiding Device and rendezvous with Odum!|
34166|If you and Odum work together, there's no way they'll complete that ritual.|
34167|The Second Prince has gone missing! How could we have let this happen?  |
34168|We must save the Second Prince!|
34169|Use the skill that matches the barrier switch color to remove the barrier.|
34170|The barrier has been disabled. The Warlock King and the Avian King are blocking the path to the ritual!|
34171|The Duke smiles and disappears at the entrance to Titan's Root.|
34172|The entrance to Titan's Root is suddenly charged with powerful magic!|
34173|Go forward and attempt to enter Titan's Root.|
34174|You've been bound by magic and drained of your power!|
34175|Press onward so that Odum and the Second Prince can stop the ritual!|
34176|Charging complete. Use tje magic barrier switch to remove the barrier.|
34177|Destroy the devices to interrupt the ritual!|
34178|Priests have appeared to thwart your efforts. Defeat them and destroy the devices! |
34179|There seem to be loud noises up ahead. Go investigate.|
34180|The Winged Duke is gone, and the power that controls the Magic Circle begins to dissipate.|
34181|The Winged Duke voraciously absorbs the life energy from the soldiers.|
34182|The power raging all around gives Odum a burst of strength, and he manages to break free of his bonds.|
34183|Help Odum save the others!|
34184|Enraged that things are not going as planned, the Winged Duke casts a spell and quickly leaves.|
34185|The path ahead is blocked by fire. Looks like you'll need to get around it somehow...|
34186|Let me help you, Odum.|
34187|Odum gives you the Divine Power. Use it to save the others...|
34188|The troops have suffered serious casualties, and you and Odum decide to return the injured soldiers to base.
You must wait for a better time to continue pursuing the Winged Duke.|
34189|Thank you for saving me.|
34190|Ow! My head still hurts.|
34191|I'll never forgive what the Winged Duke has done!|
34192|Why... why does it feel like the ground is shaking...?|
34193|I don't feel well.|
34194|You have saved three soldiers. Go and save the rest!|
34195|There aren't many captured soldiers left. Go and save them!|
34196|You saved all the soldiers!|
34197|Upon learning that his plans were sabotaged and all the captured soldiers were saved, the Winged Duke became furious.|
34198|Odum: I shall give you the power to save them!|
34199|You arrived just in time! Thanks to you, the Winged Duke's plan was foiled.
Odum is deeply grateful for your efforts.|
34200|The Winged Duke... how dare he do this to my people!|
34201|Caresha is worried that Odum can't defeat the Winged Duke alone. She asks you to help him on the front lines.|
34202|Do-re-mi, ahem... Ooh-wah-ooh, one little bunny is all alone.|
34203|Ooh-wah-ooh, two little bunnies can't find their way home.|
34204|Ooh-wah-ooh, three little bunnies won't sit still... has anybody seen the bridge?|
34205|Someone is trying to eavesdrop on Cesela's song rehearsal.|
34206|Duplicitous types who don't follow instructions ought to be punished!|
35001|The Abandoned Robot has blocked the entrace of the factory. Can you find a way to move it?|
35002|The destroyed Armor collapsed, then converged on you, encasing you in a powerful suit!|
35003|This advanced armor can perform feats of incredible strength. Use it to get rid of Abandoned Robots blocking your way!|
35004|You heard strange flapping sounds, but didn't see anything unusual.|
35005|Geshara the Nightmare Maverick's shadow power is well-suited for assassination and covering your tracks!|
35006|Vladimir the Ferrous Maverick's fiery power can scorch any target!|
35007|Montague the Gale Maverick's ice power can freeze everything in the area!|
35008|Talwagen: Target identified. Prototype machine armor Rockman. Status: AAA-class threat.|
35009|Talwagen: Hostile status confirmed. Maximum alert! Destruction Mode engaged!|
35010|After defeating Talwagen, the armor suddenly detached from your body.|
35011|Dr. Wright: Thank you. You fulfilled Rockman's mission and stopped the Iron Maverick Army.|
35012|A special target appears on the Armor's Radar - it seems that an engine that emanates a special energy is nearby.|
35013|Red Alert! Area C has been invaded! Maverick Overlord program has been activated!|
35014|Blue Alert! Area A has been invaded!|
35015|Yellow Alert! Area B has been compromised!|
35016|Dr. Wright: It's painful to see all these robots, twisted by hatred and bent on destruction.|
35017|Dr. Wright: You know, these Robots were originally produced to make the world a better place.|
35018|Dr. Wright: Dr Willie and I once worked together, studying artificial intelligence. Our hope was that robots could improve the quality of peoples' lives.|
35019|Dr. Wright: After one went out of control, everything spiraled downward. These robots now call themselves 'Mavericks' and care only for killing...|
35020|Dr. Wright: Please use Rockman's strength to stop these Robots. Perhaps in doing so, you'll understand why we originally made them.|

35032|Join Fenrich in the investigation and try to find out if the magnetic anomaly is originating from the Icebound Sarcophagus.|
35033|Surprised, you try to think back to the illusion from earlier. Could you have missed anything? You are deep in thought, when...|
35034|The Frozen Sorcerer casts a vicious spell, and a blast of cold air traps everyone where they stand.|
35035|You feel yourself growing colder and colder, until you begin to go numb.|
35036|Then, at the last moment, you feel the Power of Gaia flowing through your veins. You are revitalized!|
35037|The Power of Gaia vibrates around you, creating a powerful magnetic field.|
35038|As it expands, you pull Fenrich out of the danger zone.|
35039|Gaia's Magnetic Field grows even larger as you pour more Power of Gaia into it.|
35040|Then, you are hit with an Ice Energy spell, and the Magnetic Field contracts.|
35041|Your Gaia's Magnetic Field approaches maximum force - it is nearly ready to break through the Frostbite Energy!|
35042|The field's energy has reached its limit. Use the energy to destroy the Frost Spell!|
35043|Use Gaia's Ascendancy 5 times in a row to strengthen and expand Gaia's Magnetic Field.|
35044|If you do not use Gaia's Ascendancy for 25 seconds or more, the Frostbite Energy will shrink your Gaia's Magnetic Field.|
35045|The Frozen Sorcerer is finally gone. You and Fenrich begin to make your way out of the forest.|
35046|Use Gaia's Ascendancy to counter the Frozen Sorcerer's frost spell attack.|
35047|A bright light suddenly whizzes past, and the Frozen Sorcerer appears in front of you.|
35048|The weather turns cold again, and a freezing gust of air breezes past you.|
35049|Just as the battle is about to start, a witch suddenly appears nearby.|
35050|The situation is very tense... aside from the cold, there's something mysterious in the air that no words can describe.|
35051|At last, you and Fenrich are ready to venture into the Ice Crystal Forest to find the reason behind the magnetic anomaly.|
35052|As you return to the teleporter, you ask about the latest developments regarding the magnetic interference.|
35053|On Silverash Shore, you can catch cod to make Fish 'n' Chips.|
35054|After equipping a fishing rod and bait, catch cod to make Fish 'n' Chips and then give it to Club Cook Jose!|
35055|Fishing items can be purchased from an Anglers Anonymous Merchant (590, 176).|
35056|Please ask the Assistant Referee nearby about getting a Club Membership Card.|
35057|Oh no - the beer has been left out too long! Please abandon this quest and try again.|
35058|Wow! That's correct! You are the master of the World Cup!|
35059|Defeat Alpine Snails to obtain Superior Snail Meat. It's the best kind for barbecuing!|
35060|Sorry, that's incorrect. Please think it over and try again.|
35061|Deliver beer within 60 seconds.|
35062|Answer the question correctly|
35063|The Demon's Blood and Demon's Will clash, causing a momentary reaction.|
35064|Now is the time! Take this opportunity to damage the Demon's Will.|
35065|You shall die along with me!|
35066|You are infected while attacking the Demon's Blood - you can't move any faster!|
35067|You are infected while attacking the Demon's Blood - your spirit is damaged!|
35068|You are infected while attacking the Demon's Blood - your defense is significantly weakened!|
35069|The Demon's Blood has found its way inside Shirley's body, and she can't withstand the contamination.|
35070|You have taken command of Shirley's consciousness. Attack the Demon's Blood and Demon's Will!|
35071|The Demon's Blood, enhanced by Demon's Will, will soon appear!|
35072|Occasionally, Demon's Blood can obscure Demon's Will, and the Will is damaged by the ensuing reaction.|
35073|Successfully subdue a significant amount of Demonic Poison, ensuring that won't reappear for 5 minutes.|
35074|You have successfully thwarted infection from the Demon's Blood. For a short time, you receive Demon Antibodies.|
35075|The Demon's Will is about to expend a significant amount of Demonic Poison.|
35076|Ashe is under attack by an enemy cannon. Be careful not to stand in the firing zone!|
35077|Investigator: Ashe has activated his defensive stance, and it's protecting the demons.|
35078|You have critically damaged Shirley, and now Ashe is furious. He's in Rage Mode!|
35079|Investigator: Separate the two to break the defensive stance!|
35080|After 5 seconds, move to the bottom right - it's the place not under fire.|
35081|After 5 seconds, move to the top right - it's the place not under fire.|
35082|After 5 seconds, move to the bottom left - it's the place not under fire.|
35083|After 5 seconds, move to the top left - it's the place not under fire.|
35084|Shirley is in danger! When her HP is below 50%, Ashe protects her.|
35085|While in Guardian Mode, Ashe will protect Shirley at all costs.|
35086|Shirley is in danger! When her HP is below 50%, Ashe enters Fortitude Mode.|
35087|While in Fortitude Mode, Ashe's defensive capabilities increase significantly.|
35088|Tread lightly: After 10 seconds, Ashe will operate a different weapon for another minute.|
35089|The Demon's Blood is here! Only this can destroy the demons' Protection Shield, so make sure not to weaken it!|
35090|Help Grandma ask Berluti about all the things she just sold next to the big boat.|
35091|Kentuk is next to the Port Culinary Master. Help the guards there buy Roast Chicken.|
35092|Abbott checks the damaged flying drone and quickly discovers that the problem lies with the circuit board.|
35093|You scared the penguins away. Tell the captain that the coast is clear.|
35094|You've swallowed some blue crystal powder, but your body does not seem to react to it. Take more!|
35095|You swallow some more powder. A bit of hot air gushes to your brain, but it isn't very strong. Try once more!|
35096|You swallow more powder for the third time, and this time, it has a strong effect on your body!|
35097|As requested by the guests, go to the stall indicated by the arrow and collect the food.|
35098|I would like fried noodles. Thanks!|
35099|Cotton Candy! Give me some sweet, sweet Cotton Candy!|
35100|Get me a juicy grilled octopus kebab.|
35101|The beach up ahead is overflowing with trash. Pick up 10 trash items and give them to Jeanne.|
35102|Bring Rennes, who is injured, back to Rogers within two minutes.|
35103|You weren't in time! The teammate is pronounced dead on arrival.|
35104|You completed the customer's request. Good job!|
35105|You delivered the wrong food. You've lost a customer!|
35106|Use the Ice Bucket and complete the challenge!|
35107|The Mage up ahead looks worried. Seems like he might have dropped something.|
35108|The boy up ahead looks very sad. Go see what's the matter.|
35109|It seems the three men up ahead are sailors seeking help, although there don't appear to be any monsters attacking them.|
35110|Sorry, you failed to help Marta take care of the stall. Try again later.|
35111|Your appearance has frightened the little penguins who have been walking around the sailors.|
35112|Elric mixes the venom with the medicine and quickly drinks the concoction.|
35113|You are surprised to find that the skeleton is actually nothing but a costume disguised by a little girl.|
35114|Angela seizes on your distraction and takes off in a flash.|
35115|You have unlocked an ancient mechanism, and an elderly man appears.|
35116|Mitty immediately activated the magic memory ball. Suddenly, a translucent figure appears in front of the boy.|
35117|You have defeated the thief who captured Ilsa, and saved her.|
35118|The mechanism is still operating. You can operate it again after two minutes.|
35119|Click on Ilsa to bring her back to Tanya.|
35120|There's nothing in this mound.|
35121|With this useful tool set, Abbott was able to repair the damaged flying drone in an instant.|
35122|Hand the toolbox over to the Handy Adventurer Leader.|
35123|You are wrong. He does not have any stolen goods. Try again!|
35124|It's him! You have recovered the stolen colored diamond from the gardener.|
35125|The cooking fire has gone out. Try again.|
35126|The cooking fire is a bit weak. Add more firewood.|
35127|The cooking fire is just fine. Keep it at this level.|
35128|The cooking fire is a bit too strong. Pour some water over it.|
35129|The cooking fire is so strong that it's burnt the food. Try again.|
35130|You failed to control the fire properly, and the dish is ruined. Please try again!|
35131|Perfect! The fire is just fine. Click on Ada to start a fire.|
35132|The cooking fire has just been kindled. Now use the firewood and the water bucket as necessary to adjust your fire.|
35133|The cooking pot is in use right now. Please start a fire when no one is using it.|
35134|Stallkeeper Quest failed: You were unable to complete requests from three customers within a minute|
35135|Paper strip: A Sea Monster is attacking the sailors on a small island east of Spinel Shores. Please help.|
35136|Those lives need to be saved quickly. Head to that island now!|
35137|Tony must be worried, as he has not received the gift and the letter from his family. Go back to Mortonville and find them!|
35138|Use the key to open Abbott's Toolbox at the shipyard to collect the required tool set.|
35139|Complete requests from three guests in order to finish the quest given to you by Marta.|
35140|You abandon the quest. Marta is disappointed.|
35141|The water bucket has an inscription on it written by Jennette the Mage. With this, it should be possible to find out where the mage lives.|
35142|Go to the Blade Settlement and search for the whereabouts of the investigation team member on the nearby hill.|
35143|You carefully search for the gift box that was left behind, and for the letter from Tony's family.|
35144|The inner part of the Marble Ruins is up ahead. Use the pickaxe to help Marvin dig for three blue crystals!|
35145|Rogers thanks you, then quickly sends the injured investigation team member back for treatment.|
35146|Wasn't I just here? Am I seeing things?|
35147|Tony quickly opens the letter and the gift box, and is relieved to learn that his father is doing well.|
35148|You are scared! Grandma drinks the Miraculous Dew and finds herself turning into a maiden.|
35149|Use your skills again to deliver food to the guests.|
35150|The hot and sizzled fried noodles are ready!|
35151|The sweet cotton candy is ready!|
35152|The delicious octopus kebab is ready!|
35153|When the HP of the Ogreface Snake drops below 50%, use the empty bottle to collect its venom.|
35154|Use the snare trap when the Big Gray Wolf is nearby, then place the colorful goat into the trap to lure the wolf.|
35155|Go north of the Krampus Altar and find the skeletal remains that Coleman mentioned.|
35156|You pick up the Demonslayer Staff from the chest, and feel an huge surge of power coursing through it.|
35157|It seems that a powerful creature is trying to call upon the Demonslayer Staff.|
35158|Go to the Sidewinder Bandits hideout, located in the west and look for Ilsa's whereabouts.|
35159|Listen to the statements of the four people, and deduce which one is the culprit!|
35160|Ga, ga, ga... Seems like it really opened that crystal.|
35161|The trap will stand for 30 seconds. If the Colorful Goat was caught, collect its body to get Colorful Mutton.|
35162|You acquired the "Water Bucket". Please bring "Firewood" and look for Ada, to teach you the basics of starting a fire.|
35163|Fill up the bucket with water and bundle some "Firewood", then find Ada to ask about starting the fire.|
35164|You doublecheck the Treasure Map. This doesn't seem to be the right place.|
35165|You check the area carefully. It feels as though some sort of energy is approaching.|
35166|Use the power of the Demonslayer Staff to destroy all the vermin in the area.|
35167|Select the brotherhood that you wish to join and collect the item.|
35168|You have found the investigator at the entrance of the Sidewinder Bandits base. Now proceed to the Tocha Base.|
35169|You have found the investigator at the entrance of the Tocha Base. Now proceed to Windmill Ranch, the final destination.|
35170|The hand holding on to the staff seems to be pointing towards Candetonn.|
35171|Go to the Sidewinder Bandits base and find Mitty's grandfather's treasure. It should be buried in the earth mound.|
35172|Looking at the treasure map, it seems that Mitty's grandfather's treasure should be close by, but you can't be sure.|
35173|The mechanism is in operation. Crack the code within two minutes, or the mechanism will automatically be switched off.|
35174|Quickly put on the equipment, and then look for the investigators located at the gates of the Sidewinder Bandits base and at the Tocha camp for your confirmation.|
35175|Finally, go to the Windmill Ranch and find the judge of the Tortoise and Hare Race to complete the trial.|
35176|Attention: You must transform into a hare or tortoise in order to pass the checkpoint.|
35177|You are representing the Hare Brotherhood in the battle. As a hare, you have two skills.|
35178|One is to accelerate, and the other is placing a lobster on the route in order to stop the tortoise from advancing.|
35179|You have a strong feeling that only one out of the four people is telling the truth.|
35180|Select the real thief based on their statements and conduct a body search.|
35181|It's Ilsa who has been tied up. Defeat the guard in order to save him.|
35182|You take out Tanya's token, and Ilsa follows closely behind you.|
35183|The healing process begins, as Elric starts the long road to recovery.|
35184|As soon as he's finished speaking, Elric slips through the open portal in a flash.|
35185|You try to channel your thoughts through the Demonslayer Staff, and find that the staff responds well to your concentration.|
35186|You feel a huge surge of power enter your body from the staff.|
35187|You are representing the Tortoise Brotherhood in battle. As a tortoise, you have two special skills.|
35188|One is to accelerate, and the other is to place vegetable obstacles on the route to block the hare.|
35189|As you look at the twin girls' happy faces, you are sure that everything was worth it.|
35190|You pick up "Firewood". If the Water Bucket has been filled up, you may start the fire as soon as you've spoken to Ada.|
35191|Thanks to your expert cooking skills, Ada is able to enjoy a sumptuous picnic!|
35192|Elric casts a spell to open the portal.|
35193|Swallow the blue crystal powder and enjoy that magical feeling!|
35194|It's paralyzed. This is how it feels to be frozen.|
35195|Coleman tears up and leaves after saying these words.|
35196|As a hare, you are so entranced by the delicious vegetables placed on the ground that you are completely unable to move.|
35197|As a tortoise, you are so entranced by the fresh lobster placed on the ground that you are completely unable to move.|
35198|Looks like that's the skeleton that scared Coleman to death. Try using a magic potion.|
35199|That monster that you mentioned... is a penguin?|
35200|You pour the remaining ice water in the bucket over yourself.|
35201|Jennette picks up the bucket and pours the ice water over her head.|
35202|Tony opens the gift sent by his father - it's clothing! He puts it on straight away.|
35203|Does this blue crystal powder really let me teleport?|
35204|Abbott is waiting for the toolbox. He has no time to fight with you.|
35205|Fenrir is angry and very dangerous. His hard shell makes him a difficult target.|
35206|The adventure team quickly sets a trap. Lead Fenrir to the trap to quell his anger and restrict his movement.|
35207|The trap can quell Fenrir's anger while also restricting his movement.|
35208|Fenrir's anger has been quelled-- he's back to normal.|
35209|You've already brought back 8 pieces of beef. You really are a skilled hunter!|
35210|Cow hunters, I have 15 pieces of beef with me now.|
35211|25 pieces of beef! That's almost enough for the whole team. Keep up the good work!|
35212|30 pieces! That's enough beef for this dish.|
35213|I'm impressed! You actually managed to get 8 eggs from these fearsome birds!|
35214|15 eggs. Wow, you're really leaving your mark on this bird population!|
35215|25 eggs collected. The birds must be really angry about this.|
35216|30 eggs collected. That should be enough.|
35217|You've already collected 8 corn? That's really good!|
35218|We must be really good at collecting corn! Now we have 15 juicy ears!|
35219|I have 25 ears of corn with me right now. You're really fast!|
35220|You collected 30 corn. This dish doesn't need any more corn.|
35221|The adventure team is heating up the hotpot. Your job now is to collect all the ingredients needed for the whole team.|
35222|This delicious hotpot recipe asks for 30 pieces of beef on the bone plus the same number of Raptor Eggs and Giant Corn.|
35223|Quickly go to the location in front of Lilo indicated by the arrow and hand in the beef on the bone.|
35224|Don't leave your teammates hanging! As a member of the Yolo Adventure Team, you'd better start gathering the ingredients and complete the dish ASAP.|
35225|Use the rope twenty times in a minute to capture Fenrir.|
35226|Quickly go to the location in front of Tanro indicated by the arrow and hand in the Raptor Eggs.|
35227|Your clumsy, noisy egg collecting immediately caught the attention of the birds.|
35228|Fenrir tries to break free from the bonds you've placed on him.|
35229|Fenrir is critically injured and losing strength quickly. Now is your chance to catch him.|
35230|Collect the rope from within the circle indicated by the red arrow and use it on Fenrir.|
35231|Fenrir's regained his energy after taking a nice rest.|
35232|What a good start. The adventure team has hunted 50 animals.|
35233|That's some excellent hunting. 100 animals have been caught.|
35234|That's 150. Are you sure you're an adventure team, or are you just a bunch of psychopaths? All the animals in these grasslands are going to be extinct soon...|
35235|Obtaining sufficient food through hunting can actually help in completing the adventure team's mission.|
35236|The smell of the delicious meal cooked by the adventure team spreads across the grassland, attracting Fenrir.|
35237|As the adventure team mercilessly hunts down prey in the grasslands, the animals run away in fear.|
35238|Fenrir's been spotted. He picks up the human scent and goes into Battle Mode.|
35239|The well-trained adventure team quickly lays traps all around Fenrir.|
35240|I am taking charge of beef collection. So hand over all your high-quality beef.|
35241|I am in charge of collecting fresh eggs. Give me all your eggs.|
35242|I'll take charge of the corn. Give me all the corn.|
35243|As the adventure team explores more regions, the team discovers new animals that can be hunted.|
35244|The adventure team has completed exploring all the regions, discovering all prey in the grasslands.|
35245|Along with your Adventure Team, you have successfully captured Fenrir, the Little Hornwolf. A job well done!|
35246|Quickly head to the location in front of Cairo as indicated by the arrow and hand in the Giant Corn.|
35247|Not only does he manage to wriggle free, he also appears to have recovered from his injuries.|
35248|Emergency! Head to the bridge north of the Plateau Hunting Village immediately and ready the defenses!|
35249|You have set up the Magic Barrier!|
35250|You have ignited the firewood at the Beacon Tower!|
35251|You have set up the defensive measures. Go back and report to Greene.|
35252|Mario is reloading the ammunition that you have brought back.|
35253|Mario encourages you to fire a cannon. Try it!|
35254|The old cannon is unable to hold firepower this strong. It explodes!|
35255|The earth shakes. Even the scorpions are quickly destroyed. So that's the real power of a Mastery!|
35256|It appears that the Greatest Mastery can be achieved through non-stop practice and trials!|
35257|You have fulfilled Grandma Laila's wishes. She is now directing her thoughts up to Tomas in heaven.|
35258|After practicing five times, you will obtain knowledge about the Mastery. Go back and look for the Mysterious Person to obtain further knowledge.|
35259|Go back and look for the Mysterious Person so you can learn to perfect the Mastery.|
35260|The little tree grows under your gentle care. It's starting to look a bit healthier now!|
35261|The little tree has grown strong under your careful attention and can now survive in the desert on its own.|
35262|Suddenly, an old dryad appears next to the young sapling.|
35263|Sparrow quickly picks up the bandage.|
35264|Pay attention to the little tree's demands and give it the proper care it needs within two minutes.|
35265|Find Grandpa's box in Gelu Village and take out the supplies.|
35266|Proceed to Oland Village and purify the Wandering Lost Souls there.|
35267|Try to quickly learn the fundamentals of Masteries. Use this to start basic training!|
35268|Holt watches as his friends struggle against the Dryscale Lizards and decides to ignite a bomb!|
35269|The scorpions pick up the scent of a Bigear Primate and start crawling towards it.|
35270|The Bigear Primate is about to leave the path when it senses the danger and starts to look around worriedly for an escape route.|
35271|The Bigear Primate breathes a sigh of relief as it finally escapes the scorpion-infested valley.|
35272|The Bigear Primate, freshly escaped from its close call with the scorpions sees you as it prepares to take its leave.|
35273|The adorable primate bounds over to you in excitement.|
35274|Quickly take it out of the tree valley.|
35275|You must throw the bomb at the Dryscale Lizards within 15 seconds, otherwise it will explode in your hand!|
35276|The Bigear Primate bids you a fond farewell, then quickly runs away.|
35277|Holt passes the ignited bomb on to you!|
35278|The Dryscale Lizards scatter in panic when they see the bomb you've thrown towards them. Holt roars his approval.|
35279|Click on the Bigear Primate to escort him out of this infested place!|
35280|You put the banana into the Bigear Primate's mouth, and it gobbles it up happily!|
35281|You have injected a powerful potion into the Bigear Primate, which should help it to recover quickly.|
35282|Use the syringe to inject the Bigear Primate while it is focused on eating the banana!|
35283|The eating competition for the opening ceremony is about to begin. Go and get ready!|
35284|The robot has uncovered some Unknown Ore. Go collect it!|
35285|You have found the Mining Robot left behind by the Caravan. Use it at an abandoned Excavation Site, and you could find some surprising items!|
35286|Looks like this is the item left behind by the Caravan. The Caravan Member who dropped it might still be at the Excavation Site, or they may have returned to the base.|
35287|You dug an ancient magic scroll out of the mud. The scroll looks like it could contain the incantation that summons the Rock Monster!|
35288|Read the formula carefully, and then go to the designated place to collect the ingredients necessary for the summoning spell.|
35289|Eat 5 Roast Chickens in under 30 seconds to complete the challenge and win the "Hungry, Hungry" title.|
35290|3, 2, 1! Start!|
35291|After getting the youth potion, Sandra immediately quaffs it down.|
35292|Audy has sprinkled all the spices that you brought back over all his body.|
35293|There's a crystal clear sky-blue lake and a large lush green field here. This must be the beautiful place that Rich always wanted to see.|
35294|You recite a long incantation, just as indicated on the grimoire, and a Magic Circle appears around you!|
35295|Looking at the rock monster's strong physique, you can't help but feel proud of your accomplishment. Maybe you're naturally gifted in magic spells!|
35296|Suddenly the rock monster collapses and breaks into a pile of powdery, fine dust. The summoning power was a complete failure.|
35297|Congratulations! You ate up all the chicken within the required time.|
35298|Today must be your lucky day!. Congratulations!|
35299|Today's not looking like your day... Why don't you try what Silvestre suggested to change your luck?|
35300|Your luck has changed for the better!|
35301|You've found a special flower growing on the side of a stone, but it doesn't seem to have the scent that you were hoping.|
35302|You take out the fresh meat you got from Gloria and shake it in front of Dearie, who immediately runs up to you.|
35303|It seems the owner of this tombstone left behind a diary. Flip through the journal to see if you can find out to whom you should return the items. |
35304|The Bigear Primate is injured and cannot move around right now. Find a doctor in the Temporary Camp to help.|
35305|You collected some unknown minerals. Find Ore Expert Damien at the Temporary Camp to appraise them.|
35306|Not just anyone can be a Mage.|
35307|The critically injured Bigear Primate is losing strength quickly. Give it some bananas before it passes out!|
35308|All that time spent practicing has paid off. You've perfected the Mastery!|
35309|Learn the Advanced Mastery by using the Mysterious Person's Sandbag for practice.|
35310|Learn the Final Mastery and try it out during the final battle against the scorpions.|
35311|The bomb that you were holding has exploded! You're lucky no one was injured! Still, the explosion hasn't helped the Goblins scare away the Dryscale Lizards.|
35312|The robot conducts a thorough check, but finds no special minerals.|
35313|The ancient magic instrument loses its power after you use it three times. Return with three bandages and look for Sparrow.|
35314|The incantation does have somewhat of an effect -- you've managed to summon a strong rock monster!|
35315|You enter the correct password and the metal box opens. You can now collect the items stored inside.|
35316|You enter the correct password and the metal box opens. You can now collect the food stored inside.|
35317|Seeing all the scorpions moving about, the Bigear Primate lets out a yelp of terror and retreats to its original hiding place.|
35318|You have not taken the proper care of the sapling. Now it is all withered and dying.|
35319|What a shame! Challenge failed. Look for Kentuk to try again.|
35320|The little tree doesn't need any water right now!|
35321|The little tree doesn't need any fertilizer right now!|
35322|The little tree doesn't need any bug killer right now!|
35323|The Bigear Primate is back to peak condition and ready to go back into the wild!|
35324|You've neglected the Bigear Primate so much that it decided it was better off alone and left.|
35325|You've abandoned your job, leaving Greenie to take care of the little tree alone.|
35326|The young girl shyly confirms the book is hers.|
35327|The Dwarf Elder suddenly cries out, a ferocious look in his eyes.|
35328|Light dances in the tears of the Dwarf Elder.|
35329|You decide to reveal what really happened.|
35330|Furious, the Dwarf Elder runs off.|
35331|You decide to protect the girl's secret.|
35332|You decide to protect the girl's secret.|
35333|There is a hint of yearning in the Dwarf Elder's expression.|
35334|You decide to protect the girl's secret.|
35335|Scientist Renlay tosses meat into a pot, before adding a few peculiar ingredients.|
35336|Scientist Renlay hungrily looks at the ribs and wastes no time setting upon them.|
35337|Gremian has suddenly changed into a human!|
35338|You follow Harmus deep into the forest.|
35339|All of a sudden, four mushrooms come charging out.|
35340|After sharing some good times, you send Harmus back home.|
35341|In the blink of an eye, the Dodgeball Team get into position.|
35342|The Dodgeball Team walk around, enthusiastically discussing tactics.|
35343|A strange crocodile is approaching. Try giving it some food.|
35344|The crocodile suddenly starts to speak.|
35345|The crocodile is shedding its skin. Crocodiles shed? Who knew?|
35346|McKinley puts on the crocodile costume and leaves.|
35347|Will: "Aha! Got you! The strange animal suddenly begins to speak!|
35348|McKinley: No! I'm human!|
35349|You're about to speak, but say nothing, and feeling a little strange, you just leave through the portal.|
35350|The pocketbook has a woman's handwriting on it. There are several women in the village, go and ask around if anyone has dropped it.|
35351|Gormin Redroar: Ask Rinnis and Brulwinn, my daughter's friends.|
35352|Speak with Gormin Redroar within 30 seconds to complete the hidden quest.|
35353|Edward the Third: Scientist Renlay is busy with an experiment in Tanglevine Village. My masterpiece is depending on you.|
35354|Gremian: Wilfried has the best hair! Please get it for me.|
35355|You notice a young boy behind the Waterwheel and hurry over to investigate.|
35356|Rinnis talks to you in a low voice.|
35357|Looks like Halkyl is the key, hurry and find him!|
35358|After eating the mysterious meat, your body starts to change.|
35359|You see a tombstone, which appears to belong to James. Leave some flowers and a message.|
35360|James Botter: Thank you...|
35361|You stepped out of the Arena, so the training failed.|
35362|You were hit 5 times. For your sake, this round of training will finish early.|
35363|Start training in 5 seconds. Training will fail if you're hit 5 times, so do your best to evade for 30 seconds!|
35364|Start training! Keep on your toes! If you're hit 5 times or step out of the red area, training will be declared a failure.|
35365|You've been hit! Try to evade!|
35366|Let's start! Getting hit once doesn't matter.|
35367|But if you're hit 5 times, training will finish early.|
35368|Just hang in there for 30 seconds.|
35369|Don't step out of the circle!|
35370|Don't show any mercy! Give it all you've got! The Hot Bloods must win!|
35371|The Hot Bloods must win!|
35372|Are you alright? You've been hit 5 times.|
35373|Looks like an internal injury...|
35374|You don't want to become like Fisher!|
35375|Then let's end this training.|
35376|It's such a pity!|
35377|Everyone take a rest.|
35378|Are you wearing the legendary skateboard shoes?|
35379|You really are just like Fisher! It's a devilish pace!|
35380|You missed all of them, you're way worse than Fisher.|
35381|I'm injured, shut up!|
35382|Aren't we strong?|
35383|We may as well take a rest.|
35384|I still want to throw a few more balls!|
35385|Fisher's unhappy and wants us to practice.|
35386|Get ready for the Dwarf Dancing trial! After 5 seconds, follow the instructions and we'll see what you've got!|
35387|Give me that "wild" feeling! You move like a robot!|
35388|Now let's bring it down. Show me your smooth moves. As light as a feather!|
35389|Give me some strength! Show off that dwarf tenacity!|
35390|Great! That's it! A little more!|
35391|No good! Try again! Let's see your talent!|
35392|Looks like there's nothing else that I can teach you!|
35393|You've mastered the art of dancing.|
35394|Promoting the art of dwarf dancing!|
35395|You're keen, but you're a little uncoordinated.|
35396|No problem, just practice some more.|
35397|Seeing the innocent mushrooms and children playing together makes your heart sing. |
35398|Do you remember how long it's been since you laughed so much?|
35399|Gremian: I also need a piece of rotten meat. Renlay should have plenty.|
35400|Lily Botter: James' tombstone is in Paradise Passage. Have a good look around and you should see it.|
35401|Fisher: I've finally found someone to take my place. Prepare yourself, Michael!|
35402|Edward the Third The last time I saw Wilson was at the lake in Crystal Forest. Please go and look for him.|
35403|Edward the Third You'll find Saiko in Tanglevine Farm. I hope you'll be able to learn dwarf dancing!|
35404|Banorg: Thank you Harmus!|
35405|Gremian has turned into a dwarf again!|
35406|"Ding... ding... ding..."|
35407|Press Skills to choose your destination and you'll be able to fly there.|
35408|You recall seeing an exotic merchant by the waterfall near to the village. Could it be him?|
35409|Didn't you once hear there was a merchant selling books by the waterfall? Go over and take a look!|
35410|You see a self-proclaimed Makar inventor on the way to the waterfall. Why not go over?|
35411|Isn't that a ring in the underbrush? Go over and take a look?|
35412|Looks like there really is no ring. You'll just have to go and tell Granny you can't find it.|
35413|Go slightly to the east of Granny's location and search for a ring.|
35414|Knock out Jeszan! Stop him from quitting Dreamleaf status!|
35415|Guthug starts to eat the food you gave him|
35416|You're beginning to change in a fantastic way. That's the power of science for you.|
35417|Mooo|
35418|Moooo... moooo...|
35419|Moooo... moooo... mooo!|
35420|You fly higher and higher...|
35421|higher and higher...|
35422|After what seems like forever, you finally land.|
35423|You look around, but apart from allowing you to fly very high, this invention doesn't seem very useful.|
35424|Does that interest you at all? It's my latest invention!|
35425|A traveling artillery battery... just needs a good target.|
35426|It can fly to wherever you want it to go!|
35427|Give it a try, but if you don't use it within 30 seconds it'll be ineffective.|
35428|"Meteoric Fried Rice" is made of rice, soy sauce, egg, vegetables and shredded pork...|
35429|I use a very special method to prepare it...|
35430|I toss it high up into the air and when it comes down, it creates such intense friction, it gets cooked.|
35431|Atmospheric cooking you could say!|
35432|Just like a shooting star! It's the...|
35433|the one and only legendary Meteoric Fried Rice!|
35434|I've heard so much about it, could you help me?|
35435|I asked an inventor I just met if I could use his invention to launch the rice.|
35436|But I need someone to help retrieve it at the point of impact.|
35437|Thank you.|
35438|Marvin absentmindedly hands you the plate.|
35439|Ready? Mr. Inventor!|
35440|Bring it on!|
35441|Three!|
35442|Two!|
35443|One!|
35444|Fire!|
35445|The plate of food goes flying into the sky and quickly disappears from view.|
35446|By my calculations the point of impact shouldn't be too far away. Probably somewhere off in those rocks to our right.|
35447|In 20 seconds, go to coordinates (800, 407) to retrieve the fried rice.|
35448|You see a shower of rice grains falling from the sky.|
35449|With no other option, you collect the rice and place it on the plate for Marvin.|
35450|You give the dish to Marvin.|
35451|So the recipe even thought of this step?|
35452|Sneaky Jack places the egg on a pyre, then sets it alight. So this is how to hatch an egg.|
35453|The egg suddenly cracks. Is it hatching!?|
35454|The sky darkens with a shower of rice grains, and the famous dish seems to disintegrate in mid-air.|
35455|Pick up all the rice and put it on the plate for Marvin. A third should just about fill it.|
35456|All of a sudden there is a gust of wind...|
35457|You hear Eternia's voice speaking in your head.|
35458|"I live in the ebb and flow of time itself. All of history is open to me. I see all."|
35459|"Eons ago, there existed several humans whose Books of Destiny were but a blank page, however..."|
35460|"They were labeled heroes. Their destiny was locked, and there was no changing it."|
35461|"Their Books of Destiny could not be edited."|
35462|"You however... Your Book of Destiny is unique."|
35463|"You have a profound effect on all who cross your path. You have the power to rewrite anyone's destiny."|
35464|"Hmm... Perhaps...?"|
35465|Vault of Eternity: "Birth of Destiny - Duality"|
35466|"You were awoken by a dream of prophecy. You were awoken to become an Envoy of Gaia."|
35467|"You were also awoken by another Envoy of Gaia."|
35468|"His thirst for power... Your kindness and selflessness..."|
35469|"Did destiny throw the dice in your direction... or his?"|
35470|"Brian... Did he have the same dream?"|
35471|"The details don't make sense..." "Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35472|Vault of Eternity: "Past, Present, and Future"|
35473|"You are fated to meet."|
35474|"Odum... the mysterious Makar..."|
35475|"Perhaps he lost himself in his quest for power?"|
35476|"Or perhaps... the Templar in him was stronger than his desire for power?"|
35477|"Was it because you inspired Odum? Is that your power?"|
35478|"I think I'm starting to understand." "Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35479|Vault of Eternity: "The Seal"|
35480|"You see a sealed creature."|
35481|"Just as you're about to break the seal, it dawns on you."|
35482|"He was once an Envoy of Gaia, too."|
35483|"You hear the roar of Sonjuno."|
35484|"You can't tell if it's repressed fury or hatred of one's own weakness."|
35485|"Even if you've seen one of your own possible fates as an Envoy of Gaia..."|
35486|"You must overcome the terror in your heart. Perhaps..."|
35487|"This is the reason that the Power of Gaia chose you."|
35488|"Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35489|Vault of Eternity: "Faint Light"|
35490|"The Power of Gaia is dangerous, but it will guide to an even greater world."|
35491|"You see worlds that were once hidden. Even if you want to use halo energy to separate your Eidolon from you..."|
35492|"The Eidolon at your side will never betray you."|
35493|"When you return to Gydaie Glen..."|
35494|"You and your Eidolons will be impressed by the knowledge of the ancient dwarves."|
35495|"When you receive the halo energy, you will think: Is the adventure finally over?"|
35496|"The Spirit Separator will never achieve the expected results."|
35497|"You look at the Eidolon following you. What is it thinking?"|
35498|"Is it disappointed or rejoicing?"|
35499|"Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35500|Vault of Eternity: "Miracles"|
35501|"You obtain the miracle crystal from Maggie in the dark mine tunnel."|
35502|"Many years ago, the Shadow Knight was named the most powerful Envoy of Gaia, the top fighting force for the church."|
35503|"If he was so powerful, why did he need the miracle crystal?"|
35504|"Do miracles actually exist? Everything should be determined by destiny."|
35505|"Does an Envoy of Gaia even need miracles? Or will you overcome all?"|
35506|"Maggie... looking at a smart-looking fool."|
35507|"Some things are impossible, but deep down in your soul, do you still hope..."|
35508|"For a miracle?"|
35509|"Is hope itself the real miracle?"|
35510|"Write it down. I have an unlimited amount of time to think about it, but you don't."|
35511|"I'm sorry to keep you waiting for so long. "Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35512|Vault of Eternity: "Belief"|
35513|"In the long-lost great lands, the demon god Argus gradually disappeared in the ebb and flow of history."|
35514|"However, his followers in the Triatio Highlands continued to search for him. However..."|
35515|"What does it matter if this is true or false? In their world, their wishes had already been granted."|
35516|"In your world, who can serve as your spiritual foundation?"|
35517|"Are you still searching for this answer? Or do you already know?"|
35518|"After they saw Argus on the ground, you were called a hero by the people."|
35519|"I'm curious, what did you call yourself that time..?"|
35520|"Protector? Or one who was manipulated by destiny?"|
35521|"Did you want to become a hero? Or did the people make you their hero unwillingly?"|
35522|"No... your Book of Destiny is blank. I can't read it."|
35523|"Please leave me alone and proceed to the next chapter."|
35524|Vault of Eternity: "The Seeker"|
35525|"People who are controlled by destiny..."|
35526|"They pursue their goals with unwavering resolve. These goals, however, are illusory."|
35527|"The Sarpa Queen set out on a mad quest for power."|
35528|"She achieved her goal for a time, but then ran into you..."|
35529|"You were her destiny. If she hadn't encountered you, what type of seeker would she have become?"|
35530|"Alex... He is a seeker."|
35531|"One who once worshiped, became an enemy..."|
35532|"Would he have any regrets? Or would he walk firmly on his path?"|
35533|"He seems to have cheered up since he ran into you."|
35534|"Your presence can calm one's heart."|
35535|"Is this what makes you so unique? "Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35536|Vault of Eternity: "Heart of Chaos"|
35537|"The resting place of angels... in chaos."|
35538|"Your fate must be connected to this place, right? Let me say something."|
35539|"... Frederic's kind-hearted spirit once had a darker side."|
35540|"After he was enchanted, he yearned to transcend his physical form."|
35541|"Will he able to overcome the weaknesses of his own heart?"|
35542|"How about you? Why don't we go into Frederic's heart and see what we find?"|
35543|The time stream twists and distorts in front of you.|
35544|When you open your eyes, you find that you are back in your own body.|
35545|It seems... you can't stop Frederic's descent?|
35546|"Wrathborne Temple was once a haven of justice. It brought the immortal angels to Terra."|
35547|"They then felt the flow of time because they were shackled to it..."|
35548|"Is this what gave them such enthusiasm for life?"|
35549|"Time is limited. We must make the most of it while we can."|
35550|"... After seeing your fighting spirit, I am gradually beginning to understand."|
35551|"Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35552|Vault of Eternity: "Immortality"|
35553|"Immortality... Talamund, the immortal demon, was once a noble dragon.|
35554|"... Different from the other souls in Wrathborne Temple, he only felt fear when faced with the transitory nature of existence."|
35555|"After achieving eternal life, he let his mortal body decay."|
35556|"Is it a tale of sorrow..? "To sacrifice one's pride and buy eternal life..."|
35557|"Or revel in the glory of this world?"|
35558|"It is difficult to understand the desire for eternal life."|
35559|"You and the allies of the sacred dragon defeated the immortal demon. The roars of the dragon were heard..."|
35560|"You must have some new insight..."|
35561|"I originally didn't think that your thoughts were important."|
35562|"It looks like I must amend this."|
35563|"Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35564|Vault of Eternity: "Great Hall"|
35565|"Your consciousness has been affected. If this continues, you'll be in great danger."|
35566|"As for me... I still have some unfinished business here."|
35567|"I'm gonna have to organize your files..."|
35568|"That's it for today. Thank you."|
35569|"I think I understand why your Book of Destiny is blank."|
35570|"It's because you make your own destiny."|
35571|"Please allow me to continue to watch your battles for eternity."|
35572|"After setting foot down this path..."|
35573|"We will encounter the Scion of Fate."|
35574|Shadowstones have appeared. The Shadowstones will empower Bloodface Titanus and detonate in 3 seconds. Both you and your enemy will sustain damage from the explosion.|
35575|Prevent Talamund from reversing destiny. Should Wrenna be defeated, you will suffer dire consequences from the Force of Destiny.|
35576|If <Reversible Destiny> is destroyed, Talamund will suffer heavy damage; if <Determined Destiny> is destroyed, Wrenna will suffer heavy damage.|
35577|Talamund's attacks may destroy both <Reversible Destiny> and <Determined Destiny>.|
35578|Talamund has reversed his destiny and defeated the Divine Dragon! As a result, destiny has punished you and inflicted significant damage.|
35579|You successfully stopped Talamund! Talamund has been rebuffed and punished by destiny.|
35580|Take a look at Holden's list. It'd be better to start from the dragon's egg first!|
35581|There is a flyer in the chest. Please go to the woods in the west.|
35582|These girls are actually Cannibal Magic Flowers! If you don't defeat them, they will resume in 90 seconds.|
35583|You cover Ronny's eyes and bring him here discreetly.|
35584|Ronny is a bit nervous, but still follows you.|
35585|The relationship between Ronny and his parents is not as bad as you expected.|
35586|Seeing them interacting makes you happy as well.|
35587|Perhaps you should head home when you have time too.|
35588|The pretty girl that Diesel told you about seems to be somewhere with a lot of round platforms...|
35589|Looks like there are some potential candiates here? Look carefully.|
35590|You have to find Bennett for Maddison. He should be near the horde of rhinos.|
35591|The troupe locates in somewhere in the mountain. And the Butterfly Fairy is in somewhere even farther away. Which one to go first?|
35592|What do the soldiers prefer? You wonder how each choice could affect the soldiers.|
35593|Let's go and find more people to join the troupe!|
35594|It seems that Barbosa and Edward the Third are also around here.|
35595|Marvin seems to be closeby.|
35596|Uncle Tom seems to be nearby.|
35597|Where is Nicole's flower? You'd rather go get some water first.|
35598|Perhaps you should ask Nicole what's going on afterwards.|
35599|Ronny should be near the lake. Go take a look.|
35600|Ronny's parents are probably in the city. It won't be any trouble to find them.|
35601|Now you get them. Go find Ronny.|
35602|Where is Princess Aubrey? Would she be in the city?|
35603|Princess Aubrey seems to be around here.|
35604|Walden, you are ours, forever!|
35605|If you are kissed 20 times, your mana will be completely drained.|
35606|If you cross the line, you'll lose. Be careful!|
35607|Can you stand for 30 seconds?|
35608|The stand-in for Walden, here we come!!|
35609|We won't lose!!|
35610|No one can escape my Kiss of Life.|
35611|My love cannot be dodged.|
35612|Love is wonderful.|
35613|What a disappointing stand-in.|
35614|Go improve a bit before you come again, ok?|
35615|Looks like somebody cannot stand our love anymore.|
35616|You lose. Please come back and try again later.|
35617|Kiss of Life will begin in 5 seconds. You'll lose if you get hit 20 times.|
35618|Game starts now! Be sure to evade the kisses, if you're hit 20 times or step out of the red area, you'll lose.|
35619|You've been kissed. Walden's mana is draining...|
35620|The Holy Water will purify the ghosts on the battlefield. But where is he?|
35621|It's suddenly chilly...|
35622|The Eduardo's wraith disappears... Go fulfill his last wish.|
35623|You and Don Quixote arrive at a strange place.|
35624|You see is the giant enemy he mentioned...|
35625|And the so-called giant enemy turns out to be a statue...|
35626|But to be considerate, you keep quiet...|
35627|You tell yourself that you don't always have to speak up.|
35628|You and Pasnatte follow the leader to go watch the show.|
35629|You wonder what kind of a show it will be.|
35630|Yeshe is waiting for you. Go ask him about the current situation.|
35631|Rehia is surrounded by a group of fierce-looking sprouts. Hurry over and figure out what's happening.|
35632|Humph, I only took a nibble's worth of food to test out the grill. Why'd they have to get so uppity about it?|
35633|Fine. There's no need to supervise me. I will find the Princess on my own.|
35634|Everything seems fine with Rehia. Next, find Moe and see how he's doing.|
35635|The Grass Kingdom Civilians take the money and leave with satisfied expressions.|
35636|The Grass Kingdom Civilians leave reluctantly, grinding their teeth and muttering insults under the breaths.|
35637|Thanks to you I can continue delivering these vegetables.|
35638|No worries. I personally washed these vegetables. I will deliver them to the Princess without fail.|
35639|It looks like nothing more needs to be done for Moe.|
35640|Both Rehia and Moe should be on their way to rendezvous with Zinnia. You'd better hurry over, too.|
35641|The competition is about to start. Ask Zinnia if she's ready.|
35642|Zinnia vs Cole! The conclusive cooking competition will soon commence! Prepare yourself!|
35643|Victory will be mine! I am the Grass Kingdom's greatest champion!|
35644|My victory will be swift and effortless. Let's just finish this quickly so I can fit in an afternoon nap. (Yawn.) |
35645|The match starts in 5 seconds. Get ready!|
35646|The match starts in 3 seconds. Get ready!|
35647|Start!|
35648|I need some vegetables. Preferably some cabbage.|
35649|Find Moe a Fresh Cabbage.|
35650|The color isn't right. Get me some mushroom!|
35651|Find Moe a Fresh Mushroom.|
35652|Hmmm, the soup could use additional flavoring. I think mushrooms would do nicely.|
35653|Find Moe a Fresh Mushroom.|
35654|The aroma and taste are lackluster. I need Nutmeg, pronto!|
35655|Find Moe some Nutmeg.|
35656|Now's the perfect time to add some milk.|
35657|Find Rehia a Jug of Milk.|
35658|I need eggs! Eggs! EEEEGGS!|
35659|Find Rehia a Fresh Egg.|
35660|There's still something missing. Hmm... how about some bone?|
35661|Find Rehia an Unknown Beast Bone.|
35662|Now it's time for bacon. Bacon! Bring me the bacon!|
35663|Find Rehia some Savory Bacon.|
35664|A touch of shellfish will really round out this soup.|
35665|Find Rehia some Fresh Shellfish.|
35666|Now I need Fragrant Dew! Don't ask why, just get it!|
35667|Find Yeshe some Fragrant Dew.|
35668|I need some vinegar to alter the taste. You heard me! Vinegar!|
35669|Find Yeshe some Fermenting Vinegar.|
35670|I need something to bring out some of these flavors. Sugar? That's perfect! Get me some sugar!|
35671|Find Yeshe some Powdered Sugar.|
35672|Now I need some salt to enhance the taste. Hurry!|
35673|Find Yeshe a Salt Block.|
35674|Now I must prepare the noodles. Find me some flour!|
35675|Find Yeshe a Bag of Flour.|
35676|This isn't what I need! You must have misheard me!|
35677|Come back with what I asked for! And make it quick! We're in the middle of a competition!|
35678|The Grass Kingdom Civilians have fled.|
35679|The Grass Kingdom Civilians become belligerent upon learning they won't be receiving the money they demanded.|
35680|Ahhhh! Stop them! It's the last cart of vegetables! We must protect it at ALL COSTS!|
35681|Cole suddenly lies down on the ground and begins snoring within seconds.|
35682|It's done! The unrivaled ramen from the champion, Zinnia!|
35683|A beam of golden light shoots out from the noodles. As it ascends it transforms into flying. serpent. |
35684|Zinnia: What the!? What happened!?|
35685|Zinnia: Hahaha! Everything is under my control. That was a demonstration of my first-rate cooking skills.|
35686|What? The competition is over? |
35687|Too slow! You must hurry!|
35688|Please pay close attention to the sprouts' instructions and react as quickly as possible.|
35689|Yeshe tosses the ingredient to Zinnia after casting a mysterious spell on it.|
35690|Moe tosses the ingredient to Zinnia after swiftly chopping it.|
35691|Rehia tosses the ingredient to Zinnia after conjuring something on it.|
35692|Now let me add this... That seems right.|
35693|Huh? What did you just give me? Think it'll work? Whatever, I'm running out of time. Just toss it in.|
35694|Competing with you is such a waste of my time. (Yawn.)|
35695|You there! I, Zinnia, am the grand champion of the Grass Kingdom. I won't lose to you!|
35696|I'm taking a nap now, wake me up when you're done. (Lying down.)|
35697|Ughhh! He's so arrogant! Wake up already!|
35698|Zinnia's ramen looks absolutely perfect, whereas Cole's looks overcooked and dry.|
35699|Zinnia is the clear winner.|
35700|How is that possible?! How could I lose to you?!|
35701|Malevolent energy billows out from Cole. As it envelops people they drop to the ground in a dead faint.|
35702|I refuse to accept this! Prepare to meet your end! All these sprouts are belong to me!|
35703|You've defeated the ancient evil and the wicked aura seems to have disappeared with it.|
35704|Ramen seems deceptively easy to prepare, but it takes serious dedication to make it well.|
35705|However, as long as you learn the basics, you should be able to whip up a decent ramen bowl.|
35706|Are you interested in ramen? If you call me Master, I may consider teaching you. Now listen!|
35707|The first thing you need to prepare is the soup base. There are three elements to a good soup.|
35708|You need bones, tea or flower dew, and mushrooms.|
35709|The reasons being... never mind, that's a bit advanced for you.|
35710|For the next step you need some shellfish. At this point, the soup base should be solid.|
35711|Then we'll add in some meat. Traditional ramen requires meat.|
35712|Finally, toss the noodles into the pot and boil it really quickly! It can't stay in the pot too long! If you follow my instructions to the letter, you're guaranteed to make great ramen!|
35713|Yes, I got it. Then what?|
35714|Humph! I could have done it myself!|
35715|But it seems like you were sincerely trying to help, so, thank you. This time.|
35716|They just lost consciousness. I can take care of them myself. You may leave now.|
35717|Though there are some flaws, you still find it enjoyable.|
35718|Watching a show is surely relaxing.|
35719|Did Kumaj really commit a crime? To prove that he's innocent...|
35720|You decide to stalk him. But you'll need a disguise...|
35721|Please follow Kumaj and collect the clues sequentially. You'll have to report to Selena after 70 seconds, no matter if you have finished collecting the clues or not.|
35722|Kumaj's behaviour looks strange... You wonder why he's acting like that.|
35723|What Kumaj said is weird too... You'd better continue to follow him.|
35724|Kumaj left some hair before he left... Could it be evidence of the crime?|
35725|Kumaj is suspicious. You decide to give all the clues collected to Sienna.|
35726|Thank you! This should do it. Ha ha ha!|
35727|Princess Aubrey and Marvin should be in the Expedition Camp. Go take a look.|
35728|You think you saw a fat mouse somewhere on the bridge, but you decide to go find Barbosa and Edward the Third before checking it out.|
35729|Bring Pasnatte to watch a show with you. It's in the Tempest Village.|
35730|Try to talk to the girls in the village. Perhaps you can gather some important info.|
35731|You've collected all clues. Go back to find Samy.|
35732|You wonder what kind of things Kumaj wants to have. Ask the people in the village.|
35733|The Herb he mentioned can be found in Tempest Village. Hurry over!|
35734|You think you saw her in Tempest Village... You've need to tell her this...|
35735|Go get him some water. There are other things that can quench his thirst as well.|
35736|Let's play robots. Try to press every button.|
35737|Kumaj disappears after entering the room. You have 10 seconds to find the clue.|
35738|Report to Sienna if you have collected all the clues. Otherwise, please try again.|
35739|The flash almost blinds you. But you wonder when Princess Aubrey hid there.|
35740|Princess Aubrey has put Prince Charlie in it...|
35741|You can now find the Fatty Rat. It should be on the bridge.|
35742|You arrive at the place mentioned on the flyer. You wonder why there are three girls there. Hide in the bush nearby.|
35743|You arrive at the lake. Hurry up and find Ronny. Make sure to look everywhere.|
35744|Ronny is bullying a turtle. Stop him.|
35745|Vault of Eternity - Dragon Tyrant Taloc|
35746|"Dragon Tyrant Taloc, the legendary third dragon..."|
35747|"Don't forget in your scurry to catch the Shadow Knight that he aims to summon Taloc..."|
35748|"You haven't any hope of stopping him... After a long and arduous battle, you'll finally see the depth of your own weaknesses."|
35749|"Don't get full of yourself, I've only been going at half-speed."|
35750|"If you're going to have any chance of passing you better pay attention to the polarity."|
35751|"This is the last reminder you'll get. Scattered power is gathering to return as we speak."|
35752|"Take down Taloc as soon as you can, it's the only way to avoid a disaster."|
35753|"A new challenger? Come on then! Let's see what you got!"|
35754|"You shouldn't have come here, now I have no choice but to fight you."|
35755|"Are you really going to hide outside and wait?"|
35756|"Fine. I'll have to show you what my true power looks like."|
35757|"At least you're putting up enough of a fight to entertain me."|
35758|"Have you ever played Hide or Seek Your Doom? I was told all Humans know it."|
35759|"You run and hide. I'll seek to send you to your doom."|
35760|"I particularly like the doom part. You should hope I don't find you."|
35761|"Ready or not, here I come!"|
35762|Take advantage of this moment to deliver the final blow to the Sky Dragon King.|
35763|"Hmph, too easy. You dare to waste my time?"|
35764|"From today on, the Sky Dragons will not return to this land."|
35765|"As for you, Wind Rider, be a good little pawn!"|
35766|The tablet in front of you once sealed the Queen of the Waters, Lianne Riverwalker.|
35767|It looks like someone tried to break the seal. The power surrounding it is becoming more and more unstable.|
35768|The seal breaks and you feel a surge of magic as mist fills the area.|
35769|The mist Lianne Riverwalker summons will render you unable to attack. It's probably a good idea to avoid it...|
35770|With all the magical mist around, there's sure to be ice bombs nearby.|
35771|"What do you hope to accomplish by treating me this way?"|
35772|"It doesn't matter anyway. You won't exist much longer!"|
35773|When an ice bomb explodes it will leave behind a water source. If you pass through it you will be filled with an unstable energy. Be careful with it...|
35774|You successfully interrupted Lianne Riverwalker's gathering power.|
35775|It seems you've passed the trials. I'll have to deal with you myself..."|
35776|"These Lightning Orbs will be the last kindness I show you."|
35777|"Pay attention to the way they bond to each other."|
35778|"You won't be able to put a scratch on me anyway!"|
35779|Lianne Riverwalker focuses her energy on repelling outsiders. Who woke her up though?|
35780|The Thunder Dragon is about to switch from positive to negative. Watch out!|
35781|Protective powers have faded.|
35782|Lianne Riverwalker takes the opportunity to recover her strength.|
35783|Lianne Riverwalker won't take any damage until all of her clones fall.|
35784|Once knocked down, Lianne Riverwalker will split in two. Her power may waver, but she is still dangerous...|
35785|"The Thunder Dragon has finally fallen."|
35786|"I'd like to congratulate you for triumphing over your fear today."|
35787|"But you must know that fear doesn't come from the outside."|
35788|"It bubbles up from within you. To truly defeat it you must shine a light on the darkness inside."|
35789|"I look forward to the day when you finally vanquish it."|
35790|Lianne Riverwalker memory fades and reveals treasure chest.|
35791|Where are the team members? We'll just have to do a thorough sweep search.|
35792|Three people have been found but Marvin's whereabouts are still unknown. It doesn't matter, we must go back to the camp right away.|
35793|Snowbank needs Snowdrift, time to go find some.|
35794|Snowbank is complaining that these Snowdrift are not good enough, where else can you find other Snowdrifts? Does anyone know?|
35795|Use the water that Marvin gave you to pour it on the legendary ice.|
35796|Here it is, should you eat it or let Marvin eat it?|
35797|Help Pounder gather the opinions of the villagers. Ask the young, old, and strong as well.|
35798|That should be enough intel, report back to Pounder.|
35799|Rudi hopes to talk to other reindeers. Look for a reindeer or ask someone else.|
35800|McKinley put on a Reindeer Outfit! Hmm, time to head back.|
35801|The reindeer is missing, it's time to ask around the village.|
35802|That should be enough intel, time to report to Santa Claus.|
35803|Follow Ellie's instructions and shovel some ice, then place it on the Snowdrift.|
35804|Huh? The snowdrift has turned into a snowman! Go tell Ellie the good news before global warming leave its mark!|
35805|There's only three minutes left, hurry up and tell them your experience!|
35806|What a shame that you can't answer this. Try harder next time.|
35807|Bring Sam to look for large seals around here.|
35808|There's only three minutes left, teach Sam how to swim!|
35809|I never thought we'd run out of time. Well, I guess we'll have to give it another try.|
35810|Collect the items on Barbosa's list and come back here.|
35811|Barbosa blindfolds you and takes you to a strange place.|
35812|You open your eyes and all you can see is a large standing ice block.|
35813|Barbosa's heart sinks as he realizes the ice demon king in his dreams is only an old man...|
35814|You come back with Barbosa and hope he doesn't plan to conquer the world again.|
35815|A game that only hot-blooded men are interested in, go ask around!|
35816|Hmm, the letters have been sent and the tokens have been received. Go back and talk to Belmas.|
35817|Time for a test!! I'll fight you to the death!|
35818|Yosef must be furious about drawing rubbish, try again next time.|
35819|Wowww!! Give the card to Yosef.|
35820|Assist Prince Charlie in choosing a gift. It seems like his mind is set on a ring..|
35821|The materials that Princess Aubrey requires are on the list. It seems like the end result is a whip...|
35822|Lend a hand repairing the robot, even though it's nearly old-fangled.|
35823|The materials are all set, fix him and solve this problem...|
35824|He just needs to take a dip in a lake or river to overcome his fear. Where should we head then?|
35825|Would it be possible for Muinn to make Holy Fire out of this wood?|
35826|Muinn's soul has disappeared and the Holy Fire is on you, look for Lanni before it goes out!|
35827|That sword over there? Try to pull out the sword wearing the gloves he gave you.|
35828|Oh... The legendary sword snapped, what now?|
35829|Gosh! I think you'll need to pay for that.|
35830|It's a syndicate after all, I think you'll get fined for that.|
35831|According to Dragon Wood, the lumber thieves must be punished using the power of the Tree Spirit!|
35832|The lumber thieves have been taught a lesson, pass on this good news to Dragon Wood!|
35833|I kind of remember him eating weird things before, it's dirt this time... what a kooky!|
35834|Um, time to get Marvin to eat dirt!|
35835|Hmm, what is this place? What kind of secret is hidden within?|
35836|The totem has emitted a signal. The goddess must be awakened in three seconds or everything will be for naught.|
35837|The goddess is awake!! I finally catch a glimpse of her!|
35838|It's just like a dream...|
35839|Is that a Wobbling Chicken hidden within the Goddess? It must be an optical illusion...|
35840|All the totems have been activated, you'll just have to touch the goddess statue.|
35841|You can't face Yosef and run away...|
35842|You hand over the card to Yosef.|
35843|Sam swims forward!|
35844|Sam swims backward!|
35845|Sam swims to the left!|
35846|Sam swims to the right!|
35847|Devilhorn Dragon is gathering the source of the storm! Destroy the Magic Stone around you as soon as possible, otherwise we will be hit by the storm!|
35848|Devilhorn Dragon is gathering the source of the flames! Destroy the Magic Stone around you as soon as possible, otherwise we will be consumed by the flames!|
35849|Devilhorn Dragon is gathering the source of the ice! Destroy the Magic Stone around you as soon as possible, otherwise we will be hit by the ice!|
35850|A frenzied monster is roaring wildly on the platform. Defeat it quickly and clear the road as soon as possible!|
35851|The ground is covered with mud. If you step on it accidentally, you will be slowed down. Avoid it by all means.|
35852|Rawr!! Rawr!!|
35853|The Sandstorm Crystal's energy has successfully affected Devilhorn Dragon!|
35854|The Fire Crystal's energy has successfully affected Devilhorn Dragon!|
35855|The Ice Crystal's energy has successfully affected Devilhorn Dragon!|
35856|Thanks so much for your help! Leave the Gates of Hell to me!|
35857|We must first stabilize the Gates of Hell. It looks like we need the Grand Bishop to come here...|
35858|What is with this quake...!|
35859|A strong shockwave occured a short distance away and caused a large earthquake.|
35860|Maybe a powerful demon has appeared nearby... Quickly go and investigate!|
35861|An evil presence has appeared in the square. It seems to exude hatred...|
35862|???: Hmm... We meet again, Envoy of Gaia.|
35863|This is obviously the Winged Duke, whom you've fought before, but something seems different...|
35864|Hahahahahaha!!|
35865|Winged Duke summons Tunnelers. Watch out, and don't get too close to them.|
35866|I'm late! Darn it, I've been fooled!|
35867|Some have been infected by the Tunnelers' slime. Anyone who gets close to the infected will be infected themselves!|
35868|The Tunnelers have released an energy that makes the Winged Duke stronger.|
35869|This weirdo in the bandage must be the one bothering the fishing villagers! Take him out!|
35870|Eh? What's that? Mister, have we met somewhere before? You look so familiar...|
35871|There are some scattered parts ahead, could they belong to the machine that Petersson needs?|
35872|Argh! What do you think you're grabbing!|
35873|You hear a strange scream and a robot appears!|
35874|You stumble across a tombstone... John Doe?|
35875|John Doe vanished long ago, it's good that he'll be able to return home.|
35876|Three ghosts dance excitedly, you assume as a thank you.|
35877|Grandpa was broken down and yelled at you to move along. You think you remember seeing him somewhere before.|
35878|You might find a suitable container near the Holy Knight's Camp.|
35879|Look around nearby and collect the parts that Aku needs.|
35880|Find a usable wood pile nearby.|
35881|Look for the old man near the waterfall.|
35882|Solve the riddle to find the treasure.|
35883|After putting Alii into the urn,|
35884|you moved Alii closer to the lake.|
35885|Collect flowers near the tombstone.|
35886|As small snowflakes descend, you enter a silent winter.|
35887|"You... Treasure your last moments, before your lives end."|
35888|The crazy mumblings start again. Suddenly the snowflakes become ice picks raining down on you!|
35889|"Mere humans... You dare challenge my existence!!"|
35890|"Wait, I smell fear on you."|
35891|"Yes, tremble in fear!"|
35892|"Your fear will fill my belly!"|
35893|"Humans, how... how..."|
35894|"What lured you here?"|
35895|"Even thorns can't stop you!"|
35896|"I'm sad to see you all hurt!"|
35897|"Don't worry, I'll end your suffering!"|
35898|"Even the prettiest flowers wilt..."|
35899|"To preserve my beauty..."|
35900|"Your fresh blood is important to my cosmetics!"|
35901|Snow is falling again, washing away the horrors of war...|
35902|Von's willpower inspires you deeply...|
35903|The tree protection is defeated. His body smashes onto the flowers...|
35904|"My double is gone!"|
35905|Charm Queen has cast mirror images 3 times and is out of magic power! Now's the time to defeat her!|
35906|An alluring, flowery fragrance lingers in the air...|
35907|"If you can't even destroy these totems, you'll be no match for Misaena."|
35908|"Die, termites! You are not fit to stand before Master Von!"|
35909|"Shut up and sacrifice yourself to me!"|
35910|"Master, I never imagined we would meet here again."|
35911|"You lead me on the path of righteousness and helped me achieve this glory."|
35912|"Witness my growth and show me your powers!"|
35913|Odum Ryan's Wildness is preparing to cast "Shadow Blaster".|
35914|"Aether Bombs" appear on the ground.|
35915|"Glorious Temple Protection" Region has appeared.|
35916|"So, your power is still growing."|
35917|"It's an honour to follow your direction."|
35918|"I hope to uphold this honour and lead people into the light, just like you!"|
35919|"You have seen a familiar Seal Magic Stone."|
35920|"When the Seal was opened, you gained greater power and understanding..."|
35921|"Envoys of Gaia are powerful, but only human..."|
35922|"Select a volunteer to enter the fallen zone and bind with Sonjuno's weak Power of Gaia..."|
35923|"Be wary of the corruption that might overcome you, don't forget to use the Holy Water to cure yourself."|
35924|"After seeing the possibly-fated future of the Envoys of Gaia..."|
35925|"You know in your heart that some problems can't be solved alone..."|
35926|"Remember to look after each other, even amidst the harshest misfortunes."|
35927|"Please proceed to the next chapter."|
35928|"The holy water is purifying the evil aura on you. Please select another Envoy of Gaia."|
35929|You have to search for the true Bloodthirsty Panther to remove Brian's protection shield...|
35930|Bloodthirsty Panther is defeated. Its death creates a ring of light...|
35931|There's not enough energy for the Gaia Halo...|
35932|Brian's defense is down temporarily! Attack him now!|
35933|The Brians have a weird symbiosis when close together... Don't let them get near each other!|
35934|Brian's defense is too strong, maybe you can use the Halo on the ground again...|
35935|"This is the beginning of everything..."|
35936|"Feeling the pull of power, you've made your first choice..."|
35937|"You will never forget Brian's voice..."|
35938|"You must face your original self straight on, only then can you move past whatever blocks you."|
35939|"If you had a second chance, how would you answer?"|
35940|"Looks like the answer is in your heart..."|
35941|"Then, please proceed to the next chapter."|
35942|Odum Ryan's Wildness enters "Torrent of Time" status, will revive again after 15 sec.|
35943|Odum Ryan's Awakening enters "Torrent of Time" status, will revive again after 15 sec.|
35944|Odum Ryan's Glory enters "Torrent of Time" status, will revive again after 15 sec.|
35945|After 1 minute, all the Odum Ryan will enter "Enraged" mode.|
35946|After 30 seconds, all the Odum Ryan will enter "Enraged" mode.|
36001|Nelly: Soon your mouth will be muuuch wider! Hehehe! Don't worry, it won't hurt at all...|
36002|Simpson: Ah! Finally, someone saw the request. Quickly, quickly, come over here!|
36003|You drink the transformation as Simpson instructed. Suddenly you turn into a flying pumpkin!|
36004|Simpson: Dash it all! Something's after us! Quick, we must hide. We mustn't let her find us!|
36005|Nelly: Huh? Oh, is this the new small-type pumpkin? Maybe I was wrong! Hehe! I must have been a bit overexcited.|
36006|You will be released when the transformation spell wears off. Before this happens, try to touch the Light Orb to get Mirabelle's Blessing.|
36007|The pumpkin potion has worn off! Now that you're back to normal, the pumpkin monsters around you go dead silent.|
36008|Nelly: Run, everyone! Don't let them catch you! I'll try to save you all!|
36009|Nelly: Hmph! You annoying humans! I will not let you lay a finger on even one of these small pumpkins!!|
36010|Nelly found us! We need to retreat if we want to make another attempt at sneaking into the Haunted House.|
36011|We've lost Nelly, she was just too far away... We better head back to Simpson now to discuss what's next.|
36012|Nelly: Grr! Why can't I defeat you! This is soooo annoying!|
36013|Nelly: Aah! Look behind you! What is that!??|
36014|Nelly is about to turn around! Hide yourself now by using the hiding skill. (Hotkey: 1)|
36015|Looks like Nelly is heading towards the village - hurry and catch up with her!|
36016|Nelly: Aha! It looks like we have a new little pumpkin arriving! Come on now, stop playing hide and seek! Come here!|
36017|Nelly suddenly got mad and started to run. Now's not the time to hide - quickly, follow her!|
36018|Nelly runs into the depths of the Ghost House. Hurry up!|
36019|Nelly vanished without a trace! You had better tell Simpson what happened.|
36020|Simpson: You have to be very careful when you follow Nelly. You can't be too close nor too far away.|
36021|Simpson: If he looks like he's about to turn his head, use the hide skill to avoid detection. If you get caught, then hurry on back to me.|
36022|Tracking failed... hurry back to the hiding spot and wait for another chance.|
36023|Nelly: Pumpkin Power Activate! Hehe! Now you will never defeat me!|
36024|Nelly: Oh no... I've turned into Merrilee... I guess I'm much better looking!|
36025|Nelly: Aaaaaaand...shazam! With this much power, I'm not going down today!|
36026|Nelly: Hmph! I can't see out of this silly helmet! No, this just won't do...|
36027|Nelly: Abra-kadabra! Look at me.... Uh, wait, where is this wind coming from?!|
36028|Nelly: You...you didn't see anything, right? Who would wear such a flimsy skirt!|
36029|Nelly: Trans..form! Now you can't see me anymore!|
36030|Nelly: What is this... Powder? My nose feels terrible... Achoo!|
36031|Nelly: More than meets the eye - Transform! Hehe! Aren't I beautiful?|
36032|Nelly: Wa...wait a minute, I'm always the cutest. Don't you forget that!|
36033|Nelly: With your powers combined, I aaam.. Aaaargh?!.... Aaaargh...|
36034|Nelly:I.... I don't even wanna bother anymore. Just finish me off!|
36035|Transformation Potion time remaining: 40 seconds. Please be careful.|
36036|Transformation Potion time remaining: 20 seconds. Work harder!|
36037|Transformation Potion time remaining: 10 seconds. Hang in there!|
36038|Saint Nicolas: Excellent! I'll start repairing the sled straightaway! Just wait a bit while I go to work.|
36039|As Saint Nicolas was repairing the sleigh, the sky grew darker. The residents of the Small Winter Village went back home from the event too.|
36040|Saint Nicolas: The sleigh has been repaired, my young friend. Let's get this show on the road!|
36041|Jump onto the sleigh and then talk to Saint Nicolas to trigger the event.|
36042|The sleigh lurches forward with an unexpected heave! Aim carefully at the target and use the "Deliver Gift" skill to complete the mission.|

37001|Sonia is following you. You must bring her to the main hall of the castle to offer her tributes to the Bandit Leader.|
37002|As soon as Sonia sees the Bandit Leader, she braces herself and bravely approaches.|
37003|That's all? Don't you think it's a bit pathetic?|
37004|The adjutant turns around and commands Sonia to follow him into the underground vault.|
37005|Opening a heavy vault door, the adjutant walks you both deep inside the castle into an area chock full of treasures.|
37006|Along the way, Sonia tried to gather information about Redd from the adjutant.|
37007|Come along! We'll be there after we climb these stairs.|
37008|My husband stopped by to offer tribute a few days ago but has not yet returned. Perhaps you remember seeing him?|
37009|Lady, so many people come and go here each and every day. How would I even know which one was your husband?|
37010|He would have been carrying two large boxes. I haven't heard from him since...|
37011|Listen. I told you, I don't know. Maybe he left you to get away from all the nagging!|
37012|Alright, find a spot and set down your tribute!|
37013|Is... Is that Redd?|
37014|Sonia notices a few people locked up near the corner of the room. One of them looks like Redd!|
37015|You... You awful people! I thought we had an agreement that if we offered tribute you would leave us in peace!|
37016|Break the fence so Redd and the other villages can escape.|
37017|Let's go! I'll get you to safety.|
37018|Hurry, try to get out of the castle!|
37019|Quickly! Run before the bandits find you!|
37020|You lead the villagers out of the underground vault, following the path you followed upon entering.|
37021|Thank you for getting us out of there.|
37022|Defeat the troops guarding the hall so that the villagers can escape.|
37023|After clearing the troops, the villagers continue rushing towards the exit.|
37024|That was awesome! If you didn't show up, we'd still be stuck back there for who knows how long.|
37025|Suddenly everyone hears the sounds of footsteps and laughter.|
37026|Oh, my dear little country bumpkins, you know you'll never escape!|
37027|The exit is dead ahead! Everybody, run!|
37028|Waiting for you at the entrance of the castle, the bandit leader and his troops prepare to recapture all the villagers all at once.|
37029|Sonia is following you. You must bring her to the main hall of the castle, and give the Tributes to the Bandit Leader|
37030|Be silent and follow me.|
37031|If you keep on speaking nonsense I will shut your mouth for good!|
37032|Chateau Valentine (Dungeon)|
37033|Chateau Valentine - Main Castle Hall|
37034|Adonis and his troops join in the chase, trapping the villagers in the corner.|
37035|Sonia: There are so many tough looking bandits in front, I'm so scared!|
37036|Enter Chateau Valentine with Sonia to find the missing Redd.|
37037|You ask the villagers to stay where they are while you eliminate the bandits in the lobby.|
37038|Leader Adonis found out that the villagers are escaping! He immediately sends his troops out to recapture them.|
37039|The villagers, surrounded, see that the Guard Captain at the front door is defeated and start to run towards the exit.|
37040|Sonia: Look out, behind you! The bandit leader and his troops are gaining on us!|
37041|Fend off the bandits blocking the exit so that the villagers can find their way out.|
37042|Zinnia is waiting; go report to her.|
37043|Accompany the people of the Grass Kingdom into the mountains and find the old woman!|
37044|Wild Boars are attacking the Princess up ahead!|
37045|After a hard battle, the Wild Boars have been defeated.|
37046|Zinnia grows quiet, as if in thought.|
37047|Continue into the mountains.|
37048|A little girl appears at your door. Perhaps something's wrong...|
37049|Ask the little girl what happened.|
37050|Go with everyone to find the girl's Grandma.|
37051|There are many Wild Boars in the area, blocking your path.|
37052|There are too many Wild Boars - finishing them off would take too long.|
37053|Don't touch the Wild Boars, or they'll get angry!|
37054|You made the Wild Boars angry! Quick, find a hiding place!|
37055|You've caught up with the Grasslanders, who still haven't found Grandma.|
37056|Suddenly, a Wild Boar charges!|
37057|Help defeat the Wild Boar King!|
37058|At last the Wild Boar King was defeated, and the old woman came out of hiding.|
37059|Help defeat the Wild Boars.|
37060|Go around them and up the hill.|
37061|You woke the sleeping boar! It starts attacking!|
37062|The forest is slipping into chaos. Defeat the Starlight Golems in the forest.|
37063|The fire wall that was blocking the path ahead has now been extinguished. You can now safely make your away out of the forest.|
37064|Follow the indicators to leave the forest.|
37065|Soreth: These Envoys of Gaia are such troublemakers. Stand back! Watch and witness my power!|
37066|If you are hit by the Meteor Whirl, you'll lose consciousness, so try to avoid it while following the indicators leading you out of the forest.|
37067|Soreth: Hmph! Hmph! This ain't over yet! Come! My minions!|
37068|The bridge to the exit has been blocked by the fire wall, and there's a Giant Cliff Demon standing guard in front. Defeat the Demon first.|
37069|Defeat the Giant Cliff Demon who is guarding the bridge.|
37070|Just as the defeated Giant Cliff Demon crashes to the ground, you hear a familiar voice ring out from the bridge.|
37071|Approach the fire wall to see if you can identify the source of the voice.|
37072|At the other end of the fire wall, there's another familiar voice that keeps calling your name.|
37073|Sounds like it is Victoria. You immediately call back.|
37074|Victoria: Excellent! It's you! Stay where you are! I'm coming to save you!|
37075|Victoria casts the holy light spell to remove the fire wall.|
37076|Go, quickly! The Lavalord is waiting for you up ahead. Now's your chance to settle the score with him once and for all!|
37077|Go with Victoria to challenge the Lavalord.|
37078|Soreth: As if someone as scrawny as you could cause me any grief. Come on then! Let's get this over with. Let's have a fair fight!|
37079|Suddenly, you sense a strong sense of evil, and you feel yourself falling, as everything around you turns black.|
37080|A Charred Forest Fairy suddenly appears as if from nowhere and casts a spell that stops Victoria from moving.|
37081|Defeat the Charred Forest Fairy to save Victoria.|
37082|Soreth: You fools! It's not her you were supposed to catch! You've brought me the wrong person!|
37083|Soreth: Never mind! You're nothing but a bunch of thick skulled oafs! I suppose I'll need to fight this battle myself. Prepare to meet your doom!|
37084|Soreth charges the Glittering Stone with a huge infusion of power, summoning the Meteor Whirl.|
37085|Soreth: You fools! You incompetent sods have ruined my plan! Die! Die, all of you!|
37086|Soreth: Hmph! Never mind, you take care of them. Just don't make me wait too long! I have things to do.|
37087|Demon corpses and traces of the mechanism can be seen scattered everywhere. It seems the demons have already invaded here.|
37088|Oh no! The demons have invaded. We need to hurry up!|
37089|Looking at all the dead demon bodies lying around, you shudder and tell yourself that it's lucky you didn't force yourself into the mechanism.|
37090|Arliss is under attack by some unknown creatures. He needs help!|
37091|This... What is going on? They shouldn't be attacking me!|
37092|Rabisu: How's it feel to be attacked by the Sword Spirits? Haha! I'll let them have a bit of fun with you first before I finish you off!|
37093|It seems like there's something behind the mysterious magic barrier on the left...|
37094|Rabisu: Hmm, looks like those spirits were only halfgrown runts... What a bunch of useless weaklings!|
37095|Rabisu: Oh well. I guess I'll just have to finish this myself!|
37096|Fern, Riley: Die! You wretched little...!|
37097|The demons seem to be controlling the Sword Spirits and using them as weapons.|
37098|All of a sudden, bolts of Dark Lightning shoot out from the sky!|
37099|Just as you are diving for cover, a beam of holy light appears and blocks the Dark Lightning.|
37100|Watch out!!|
37101|Keres: Hey! I have no time to bother with the likes of you, I've got other things to do.|
37102|Just despicable... Now she's escaped!|
37103|Isai! Are you alright?|
37104|Isai!|
37105|Yes, I'm OK. I just need to rest. I'll be fine.|
37106|Keres runs further into the depths. We must stop her from getting the holy sword at all costs!|
37107|There are no obstacles along the way. Everything seems eerily quiet...|
37108|Arliss is up ahead! He has a problem with the hurricane!|
37109|The wind on this vast square is getting stronger and stronger!|
37110|Suddenly, the Storm Overlord Manticore appears in the midst of the strong winds!|
37111|You must defeat it! And stop Keres from getting the holy sword!|
37112|Two great rifts suddenly appear in the sky, out of which pour a vast swarm of demons.|
37113|But, just in time, Fletcher and Freddy arrive with their warriors!|
37114|Go and chase after them! You mustn't let the demons get the holy sword!|
37115|Be careful when killing the Sword Spirits, as they will release a mass of disgusting, venomous demon worms!|
37116|Just despicable... Who dares interrupt me while I am in the middle of casting a spell?!|
37117|Well done, Mia! I'm going to hit you, you wretch!|
37118|Can't... let... the demon... get... that...|
37119|Thanks for your help back there. Now let us take care of these demons!|
37120|Leave this to us! You must go quickly and stop Keres!|
37121|Curse you! How dare you try to bully my little girl!|
37122|If it wasn't for this nice lady caring about you, you'd already be dead!|
37123|Come! Servants!|
37124|Go! You must stop them!|
37125|Argh... Help me... We can't let them win...|
37126|Scram!|
37127|Let's see about waking up those Sword Spirits. I'll go in and meet you later!|
37128|You spot Keres up ahead. She is walking up towards the holy sword altar.|
37129|Oh... So this is the holy sword? It doesn't look so special.|
37130|Stop! I won't let you get away with this!|
37131|The time has finally come to fulfill the tribal oath that was put into place for the treaty...|
37132|Revive! Protection statue!|
37133|You just refuse to give up, huh?|
37134|Looks like I'll have to teach you a lesson!|
37135|I'll shred you into nice little pieces!!|
37136|No... How can this be...|
37137|Keres: Why, you little... How dare you try to bully my little girl!|
37138|Keres: You have this nice lady to thank for your lives! Without her, you'd already be dead!|
37139|Head inside and stop Keres from getting the holy sword!|
37140|You! You're such a bother!|
37141|You can see demons pouring out through great rifts torn in the sky. These demons will enhance Keres's abilities.|
37142|In 20 seconds, more demons will emerge from the sky rift.|
37143|The mushrooms that have been mutated by the evil power dash towards you in anger!|
37144|Mushroom Elder: Now I'll use my power to destroy all of you vermin!|
37145|"My dear! Who's been hurting you? Tell me!"|
37146|Grandma Piero rushes out in anger!|
37147|"Let's dance, shall we!" A beautiful voice sounds in your head.|
37148|The elegant Mushroom Queen appears!|
37149|"I didn't expect you all to just appear after I conquered this place!"|
37150|The earth shakes, and with a huge explosion, King Chinopi appears!|
37151|Chinopi the Mushroom King glares at you angrily.|
37152|After much hard work, you have finally restored peace to the Emerald Marsh in the Otherworld!|
37153|Rabisu is forced to revert to her original form! Now do away with her once and for all!|
37154|Caution: Being infected by Ice and Flame Poison simultaneously will cause severe injury and damage.|
37155|Ohh, you...|
37156|Just as Keres is defeated, a mysterious figure appears...|
37157|Keres... You have lost...|
37158|Euronyme...|
37159|Say no more. The Queen isn't yet ready to give up on you. That's why I've been sent here.|
37160|You bunch of weaklings...|
37161|We will see you again...|
37162|Caution: If you defeat just one of them and then leave the battle, the enemy you defeated will recover.|
37163|It's you again!|
37164|Thank you for successfully protecting the holy sword.|
37165|Hoo! Our lifelong mission has come to an end today!|
37166|As a strong wind whips around, the secret treasure chest suddenly appears in a cloud of dust and smoke.|
37167|Hansel and Gretel: "Wait!"|
37168|Hansel and Gretel appear in the midst of the strong wind.|
37169|Gretel: "I found the secret chest first!"|
37170|Hansel: "That's as maybe... But you can't take it!"|
37171|Ladies and gentlemen! Card Duel warriors near and far! If there are no other challengers...|
37172|I am happy to announce that our top three winners for today are...|
37173|Wait a second! I want to issue a challenge!|
37174|Hmm. Sure. It's a bit late, but I suppose we can make an exception, just this once.|
37175|Just to spice things up a little bit. Okay, let's see what you've got, challenger!|
37176|First, just a simple breakdown of the rules: You must defeat all opponents one by one, then claim the corresponding rewards!|
37177|You only get three attempts for each challenge!|
37178|Come on! Give it your best shot!|
37179|Hey! I want to be the first one to take you out! I warn you, I've been practicing!|
37180|Let's get this over with quickly! I can't stay long! My grandchildren are waiting!|
37181|"With greater power comes greater responsibility! Let's see your skills!|
37182|"Hoho! You are better than I expected! I'll be your next opponent!"|
37183|Dang, kid. Have you been practicing in secret? Come play with me!|
37184|See how long you can last against a real opponent!|
37185|It'll be a day to remember - the day you ALMOST beat Captain Starling."|
37186|"'Manners maketh the man.' Did you know that? No? Well then, prepare for a beating!|
37187|I don't care who you are, where you're from, or what you did, as long as you bow before the terrible power of my incomparable might!|
37188|Disappointed, you leave the venue. Looks like the Duelists' Temple isn't an easy place to fight!|
37189|You clinch the top prize and leave the venue, the crowds' adoring applause still ringing in your ears!|
37190|Come at me, bro! Bring it on, my dude!|
37191|Click-on the Third Place winner to start a card duel|
37192|Click-on the Second Place winner to start a card duel|
37193|Click-on the First Place winner to start a card duel|
37194|Host: You have two chances remaining. Try again!|
37195|Host: You only have one chance left. Be careful now!|
37196|The audience cheers wildly!|
37197|You discover a man changing in the bush.|
37198|Jann vanishes into the bush.|
37199|You did not find anything in the bush.|
37200|House on Shore|
37201|A Birdbrain emerges.|
37202|McKinley jumps out from the bush, and scarfs down all the food before you can say "boo".|
37203|Capture the Birdbrain and put it in the Burlap Sack.|
37204|The Birdbrain wasn't tempted by your attempts to entice it.|
37205|Quack, Quack... So disgusting! Quack! Quack!|
37210|You put on Dr. Pybb's armor.|
37211|You shoot Dr. Pybb's magic enlargement ray into the ant colony.|
37212|By enlarging one of the ants and shrinking yourself, you're able to jump onto the ant's back and control it. Giddyap!|
37213|The enlargement ray struck the beetle. It starts to grow larger. Now that's a mount! You reverse your ant and jump onto the beetle.|
37214|Suddenly a parrot flies out from the tree, and eats the still-ballooning beetle. Luckily, you're able to hop off just in time and return to your normal size.|
37215|Bzzz... You can't see me! You can't see me, but you can hear me! I am a cicada, bzzz bzzz! Cicada! Cicada! Rah rah rah! Bzzz bzzz!|
37216|There are a few baby beetles next to the tree, you could try shooting them.|
37217|Ha! Bugs! Delish! Ha!|
37218|You shoot the baby beetle with the beam.|
37219|Nothing happens. The beetle runs off, giving you an angry look as it scuttles away.|
37220|When you shoot the beetle, something suddenly drops from above, blocking your beam.|
37221|The experiment is complete! Now go back and report to Dr. Pybb.|
37222|Some special energy field seems to be surrounding Dr. Pybb and interfering with the beam.|
37223|Lulu is affected by Punishing Nightmare. You are currently unable to deal her any damage. If you distract her, you may be able to remove the status.|
37224|Take the torch from the campfire and use it to set Vicki's coffin on fire.|
37225|You use the torch to keep the fire in Vicki's coffin lit.|
37226|The blaze in Vicki's coffin has gotten out of hand and Lulu is busy trying to repair it. Repairing the coffin releases her from Punishing Nightmare.|
37227|Vicki's coffin is damaged beyond repair.|
37228|Lulu is enraged because Vicki's coffin has been burnt to a crisp. Punishing Nightmare has been removed and Lulu's fighting power has been boosted.|
37229|Get away! Nobody's going to stop me!|
37230|When Scheel gets close to Lulu he will cast his Time Shield to deflect damage. Find a way to divert his attention while you attack Lulu.|
37231|Scheel has put up his Time Shield to protect Lulu. Attack him and distract his attention so you can dispel the Time Shield.|
37232|Scheel has been distracted and the Time Shield has disappeared. Hurry and get him away from Lulu before he can put up the shield again.|
37233|Scheel has cast Dimensional Shift to return to Lulu's side and is continuing to cast the Time Shield for her.|
37234|Scheel has cast the Time Shield for himself, resisting all damage.|
37235|Lulu's Punishing Nightmare has disappeared and she has gone back to her previous state.|
37236|Scheel contains his anger and returns to Lulu's side.|
37237|Lulu seems to have regained some of her consciousness and discovers Scheel standing there.|
37238|Lulu's injuries are too much for her to bear. It's pointless continuing the attack.|
37239|Scheel, realizing that he has been unable to protect Lulu, loses his power to resist. Now's your chance to crush him!|
37240|Scheel, unable to recover from his injuries, is at the mercy of the villagers.|
37241|You sense something unnatural in the movement of the air at the Magic Barrier up ahead.|
37242|Kalussoz: Humph, do you really think I didn't know you'd charged in?|
37243|Even if you do destroy the Magic Barrier, it's too late...|
37244|The final part of the plan is already underway...|
37245|We will seize the Marsh regardless of the cost and kill every last dwarf. Bwahaha!|
37246|Looks like we need to pick up the pace.|
37247|Hee hee...|
37248|The defeated conjurer flashes a cryptic smile.|
37249|As the conjurer breathes his last breath, the Magic Barrier spell also disappears.|
37250|Titus Snaipe: Competition starts in 10 seconds.|
37251|Titus Snaipe: Get Ready!|
37252|Titus Snaipe: Go! Light your inner fire!|
37253|Terrible, just terrible! It's a fake Treasure Chest!|
37254|Simmond casts a spell at the medal, opening up a rift to another dimension.|
37255|You enter the dimensional rift, and after a short time you arrive at the Magic Barrier barricading the entrance to the dimension.|
37256|The fake Tresure Chest slowed you down for 3 seconds!|
37257|Titus Snaipe: Game Over! Someone hits the finish line in the cheer!|
37258|Titus Snaipe: What a game!|
37259|Titus Snaipe: Let's start the award ceremony!|
37260|Titus Snaipe: Don't be frustrated because you didn't win! Next time!|
37261|Skill acquired: Beebis Stimulant - Move SPD +5 sec after use.|
37262|Skill acquired: Set Fake Treasure Chest - stuns for 4 seconds after 3 seconds of touching it.|
37263|Skill acquired: When it strikes a target, the lightning wave explodes, damaging nearby targets.|
37264|Titus Snaipe: One round down, two more to go, great job!|
37265|Kalussoz opens a black Magic Barrier around himself, while Simmond is suddenly trapped inside a cage.|
37266|The Magic Barrier is absorbing Simmond's strength. Defeat the guards, then break the Magic Barrier.|
37267|The Magic Barrier has disappeared. Seize your chance and defeat the conjurer with Simmond.|
37268|Oh no!|
37269|I can only take you this far. Stopping the giants is all down to you.|
37270|The giants keep close watch over their territory, so getting into the ruins isn't going to be easy.|
37271|They're not going to allow you to interfere with their ceremony.|
37272|Who? I'll slaughter him!|
37273|Hanba Conjurer: Humph! Don't let them get away with it!|
37274|Hanba Conjurer: Belleck! Rip them apart!|
37275|This giant here is in urgent need of medical care! I'll deal with this.|
37276|The blaze that was blocking the path has died out, and from further in, the muffled sound of chanting can be heard.|
37277|The rumbling of a fierce earthquake has awoken the War God statue.|
37278|Mighty, ancient War God! Please, answer our call!|
37279|Wait, something is not quite right here.|
37280|Destroy... kill them all...|
37281|I'll leave this one to you. I'll go back and report.|
37282|Allow me to handle this, Miss.|
37283|Okay, good. You'll get your reward later...|
37284|How'd it go? Did you make it to the core? Am I late?|
37285|Damn it! Someone's been pilfering my eggs! Check out my enchantment technique!|
37286|Seeing these eggs has made my day!|
37287|This one's filthy...|
37288|Just a little more effort, and I'll have a hundred eggs.|
37289|Keep at it, youngster!|
37290|You feel giddy, unable to recall what just happened...|
37291|Huh? What's going on? Where'd my eggs go?|
37292|This snotty little egg thief has pilfered a fair few of my eggs. I'll have to be more vigilant in the future.|
37293|There seems to be someone patrolling up ahead. If you can sneak in without being seen, you may have an unexpected harvest.|
37294|There's a pyre with some white smoke coming of it. Looks like the fire's just gone out.|
37295|Feeling bored, you decide to re-ignite the pyre, and are surprised to find there are now fewer thorns blocking the path.|
37296|The pyre is covered in a gummy, foul smelling brown substance. It won't light.|
37297|You quietly tap open the eggshell and remove what's inside. Doesn't seem like anyone's seen you.|
37298|This egg thief is rather strange. I'll have to step up my patrols.|
37299|As you tap open the egg, you're shocked to discover the egg thief standing right behind you. He looks furious!|
37300|You get the sense that since the emergence of the Treasure Chest, the hazy light has grown brighter.|
37301|Just as you're about to mention this to Simmond, he charges off in the direction of the Conjurer.|
37302|Don't imagine for even one second that you can destroy the Magic Barrier!|
37303|Use this holy power to destroy the magic barrier column.|
37304|Tanglevine Village North Entrance|
37305|Forest Trail fork in the road|
37306|Store Street|
37307|Wildheart Canyon West Side|
37308|Wildheart Canyon East Side|
37309|Wildheart Canyon Path|
37310|Pick up the rock and throw it at the bucket to distract the g\iant's attention.|
37311|This is the place. Go and report to Simmond.|
37312|Amaterasu: "I've been looking for this for ages..."|
37313|Amaterasu's form gradually appears in a column of light.|
37314|Amaterasu: "Didn't we say finders keepers!"|
37315|Amaterasu: "If you don't know how to be considerate to others, then I'm going to have to teach you a lesson."|
37316|That's amazing!|
37317|Yeah!|
37318|Well done!|
37319|Whew...|
37320|Oh yeah!|
37321|Nice, nice!|
37322|That was tough!|
37323|Haha!|
37324|Titus Snaipe: Remember that the competition only runs for an hour!|
37325|Titus Snaipe: I'm sorry, time is up. There was no winner in this competition!|
37326|Titus Snaipe: Competitors, if you're ready to leave, please come find me!|
37327|Those who've made it to the end must come find me to be recognized as number one!|
37328|The Vortex Energy is searching for a target. Stay absolutely still.|
37329|Attack the bloodthirsty panther to generate the Power of Gaia, which can be used to dispel Brian's Gaia Protection.|
37330|Pay attention to the Evil Contamination affecting you. Enter the spring of purification to cleanse the contamination.|
37331|At 30 stacks, Evil Contamination will transform you into a zombie. Get to the spring of purification as soon as possible!|
37332|Asheara's Wisp will deal significant damage to her enemies.|
37333|Titus Snaipe: Okay! Two down, one to go!|
37334|"So annoying! Stop with the singing already! I can't take it anymore! I'm going to tear you to pieces!"|
37335|Use the skills of the corresponding attribute to break free.|
37336|You didn't make it in time and the elements backfired.|
37337|The spring nearby can put out the Blazing Hellfire. But each can only be used once.|
37338|Neqzal's attack and skills will inflict Blazing Hellfire on targets.|
37339|As the Secret Treasure appears, you smell a faint fragrance of tea.|
37340|Alice: "The chest is crucial for our Tea Party."|
37341|Alice: "You're not allowed to touch it unless you become a member of the Tea Party."|
37342|Alice: "Jeez, why don't you obey the rules?"|
37343|You feel a wave of cold energy as the Secret Treasure appears.|
37344|Ayako: "Food! It's food! It smells good!"|
37345|Ayako: "There must be some delicacies hidden in the chest!"|
37346|Ayako: "The food is all mine. Keep your hands off it."|
37347|Snow Sprite Sentinel: Humans again!|
37348|Snow Sprite Sentinel: Everyone get ready!|
37349|Snow Sprite Sentinel: We must defeat the humans! Kill all the humans!|
37350|Is that Snow Sprite singing? What a horrible sound... Let's go.|
37351|Looks like this Snow Sprite is still in training...it should really keep practicing.|
37352|Is there a Snow Sprite stuck in that tree? Come on, let's go.|
37353|My king! My king! The humans are coming!|
37354|Ack! The King is still drunk...|
37355|My king! My king! Wake up!|
37356|Uh... Ah... Hm...|
37357|Surrounding Snow Sprites: Nooo! How could the king lose? Run!!!|
37358|No! I didn't lose!|
37359|I'm just...returning to the earth!|
37360|Snowman: Come here! Help me for once!|
37361|Snowman: ... Where did everyone go?|
37362|Snowman: I won't forget these meddlesome humans!|
37363|Snowman: Where are the other two?|
37364|I don't know!|
37365|Shh! Don't be so loud!|
37366|Snowman: I have to be loud or you fools won't hear me! Now, wipe the floor with these humans!|
37367|Aye!|
37368|Snowman: Well? Where's the other one?|
37369|Maybe the cold weather scared them off...|
37370|Snowman: You're Snow Sprites! Don't tell me you're afraid of the cold! Now, attack those humans!|
37371|Snowman: You know what to do!|
37372|Are we retreating?|
37373|Snowman: How dare you say that! Attack these humans at once!|
37374|After much hard work, you have finally restored peace to the Silent Ice Field in the Otherworld!|
37375|I gave up my love, and all for nothing...all my dreams, shattered!|
37376|Hmph! This one is pretty strong!|
37377|Is anyone coming to help me?|
37378|Stop that Mage from singing!|
37379|Every time the Mage sings, it triggers an avalanche!|
37380|That's an awful lot of snow... The Snow Sprites are scared!|
37381|Finally! The Mage stopped singing!|
37382|You're welcome! Let me sing you one more song!|
37383|Ohoho! Did you see that beautiful shot?|
37384|The Boss knocked out an enemy!|
37385|Let them feel the icy power of Snow Sprites!|
37386|Come on! Champion Boss!|
37387|This ain't over yet! Come back again!|
37388|How did the priest get stuck up there?|
37389|The priest is afraid of big open spaces...|
37390|But so are we!|
37391|How are we supposed to help?|
37392|Help me! Please!|
37393|Go, Boss! Defeat this human!|
37394|Villagers will turn into Abyssal Monsters if Abyssal power accumulates to a certain level.|
37395|Magic Energy can be transmitted to the villagers. The Demon Stream Power can heal your companions. The Demonic Shield can protect your companions.|
37396|Channel the power of the Abyss to enter the village|
37397|The Mirror Orb emits a strange light.|
37398|The ritual begins. Abyssal Baptism.|
37399|Withstand the Abyssal creatures' attack.|
37400|Embrace the pain.|
37401|After being attacked you acquire Abyssal power for a short period.|
37402|Pass it to Arliss on the other side.|
37403|If the Abyssal power dissipates,|
37404|it can be reacquired by either defeating the Abyssal creatures|
37405|or by being attacked by them.|
37406|Working alone is not an option for this ritual.|
37407|Assist and trust your companions.|
37408|Feyna and Arliss's Shades have retreated to both sides of the hall.|
37409|Feyna the takes out the evil Abyssal Creature|
37410|and proceeds to explain the ritual.|
37411|This ritual enables you to absorb the necessary Abyssal energy.|
37412|During the ritual you need to keep three things in mind:|
37413|First, embrace the pain. Do not be afraid.|
37414|Absorbing the Abyss Energy directly will undoubtedly cause some damage.|
37415|I will therefore carefully control the release of energy.|
37416|Second, some Abyssal Creatures will try to disturb the ritual.|
37417|You have to figure out a way to eliminate them.|
37418|Third, some energy will be dispersed during the process.|
37419|You can retrive it again after killing those creatures.|
37420|Okay. Enough talk!|
37421|The Residual Power of Lightning in the area has dispersed.|
37422|The Residual Glacier Power in the area has dispersed.|
37423|The guards have been defeated. The barricade is destroyed.|
37424|The Sacred Strength hovering over the village is slowly vanishing.|
37425|The Mirror Orb has once again emitted a strange light.|
37426|The Mirror Orb gradually disappeared.|
37427|Before your eyes stand the minions of the Deep One.|
37428|Protect yourself and your companions! Hold the line!|
37429|The portal and the soldiers disappeared. Is that it?|
37430|The light from the Mirror Orb slowly vanishes and strange creatures start to take form.|
37431|The creatures' corpses start to gather on the battlefield. There is a sense of foreboding in the air.|
37432|The creatures' corpses turned into a portal!|
37433|Robyard has been killed. A Magic Circle of Darkness has opened up! Defeat the rest of the bosses, quick!|
37434|Fester has been killed. A Magic Circle of Ice has opened up! Defeat the rest of the bosses, quick!|
37435|Baldoran has been killed. A Magic Circle of Storms has opened up! Defeat the rest of the bosses, quick!|
37436|Robyard is resurrected after a short break in the Magic Circle of Darkness.|
37437|Fester is resurrected after a short break in the Magic Circle of Ice.|
37438|Baldoran is resurrected after a short break in the Magic Circle of Storms.|
37439|The minions of the Deep One keep appearing! Take them out now!|
37440|Three henchmen of the Deep One emerged. Figure out a way to separate them while killing them at the same time.|
37441|Emerging at the same time are three original bodies of the Deep One and the purple magic circle left by the angels.|
37442|Step into the purple magic circle, it can channel energy to attack the Deep One, which helps nullify the Deep One's shield.|
37443|As the creatures emerge, the HP of the Deep One will slowly heal.|
37444|But the creatures can only be taken out for a short time. They will return from the void after 30 seconds.|
37445|From the void comes the disturbing sound of footsteps. Beware of new enemies!|
37446|The young man in the front roared and his body turned into that of a monster!|
37447|As his appearance changes you can feel the strength coursing through his body|
37448|Defeat him now!|
37449|You defeated the creatures again. A huge treasure chest appears in the center.|
37450|The Mirror Orb once agains starts to emit light.|
37451|The Shade vanished... as if nothing ever happened.|
37452|The Floating Orb shines once again. Another young man's shadow starts gaining shape, turning into something tangible.|
37453|The Mirror Orb emits light once again, this time reflecting Arliss's exhasuted body.|
37454|Endure the Abyssal creatures' attack.|
37455|Abyssal power has been acquired, passing it onto Arliss.|
37456|Dissipated Abyssal power can be retrieved from the Abyssal creatures.|
37457|The Mirror Orb emits normal light.|
37458|Feyna: How do you feel brother? We are about to start.|
37459|Feyna: Hang in there! It's almost over.|
37460|A strange power starts to grow within...|
37461|Is this... Is this how it feels like to absorb Abyssal Energy?|
37462|Ahh! My body... It's changing!|
37463|Sis... I don't think... I can't take it anymore!|
37464|Ahhhhhh!|
37465|Arliss: Nnnghhh... Ahhhhhhh!|
37466|Arliss screams in agony!|
37467|Is... Is the ritual over yet?|
37468|Arliss regains consciousness and resumes his journey.|
37469|Arliss: Sister... Mom and dad... Everyone...|
37470|Will this be the final battle?|
37471|The Mirror Orb shines like the sun itself!|
37472|The empty hall is left with just the pale Mirror Orb|
37473|Transform the soldiers on the left side.|
37474|Transform the soldiers on the right side.|
37475|Transform the soldiers behind the barriers.|
37476|A Magic Circle of Lightning emerges|
37477|An Ice Barrier blocks the way. Find a way to remove it.|
37478|Transform the soldiers using Holy Attacks.|
37479|A Lightning Barrier blocks the way. Find a way to remove it.|
37480|An icy mechanism appears|
37481|Stage one clear! Transform the next wave of soldiers.|
37482|The sacred power from the Goddess Statue lingers on. Transform the soldiers near the pillars.|
37483|The sacred power from the Goddess Statue has dissipated. Let the Goddess Statue be infested by Abyssal Energy.|
37484|Transform the remaining soldiers!|
37485|Hahaha! Perfect! The village has been breached!|
37486|You have acquired Abyssal Essence - Darkness. You have to bring it to the Magic Circle of Darkness, quick!|
37487|You have acquired Abyssal Essence - Flame. You have to bring it to the Magic Circle of Flame, quick!|
37488|You have acquired Abyssal Essence - Ice. You have to bring it to the Magic Circle of Ice, quick!|
37489|You have acquired Abyssal Essence - Storm. You have to bring it to the Magic Circle of Storms, quick!|
37490|A long time ago, there was a village in another dimension where many luminous orbs dwelled.|
37491|These Light Orbs are simply referred to as Holy Beams.|
37492|The Dawn Tribe. They hear people's prayers and do their best to make them real.|
37493|Altough they complain from time to time, the Dawn Tribe manage to answer all the prayers through a lot of hard work.|
37494|Then one day the unthinkable happened...|
37495|Zanotas invaded their village!|
37496|The Dawn Tribe fought back against the endless waves of the Deep One, but they managed only token resistance...|
37497|Arliss returned and rushed the Deep One's vanguard!|
37498|Your prayers have been heard...|
37499|To defeat Zanotas you must turn his summoned creatures against him.|
37500|Once you've dispatched the monster, head to a corresponding magic circle to deposit energy.|
37501|Abyssal Essence - Dark completed.|
37502|Abyssal Essence - Ice completed.|
37503|Abyssal Essence - Storm completed.|
37504|Abyssal Essence - Flame completed.|
37505|Every 30 seconds Zanotas will change its element and gain a special protection, becoming immune to damage.|
37506|Step into the Magic Circle corresponding to Zanotas's element to nullify his protection.|
37507|Who would've thought... this is not the end...|
37508|Feyna decided to go after Zanotas, her thoughts consumed by vengeance.|
37509|Zanotas is getting ready to change his element. Please! Be careful!|

37521|You have poured enough energy into the magic circle. Get ready for a fight!|
37522|Well well, so these are the Holy Light Orbs?|
37523|The coast is clear, but the air here reeks of murder.|
37524|Humans! Do not come any further!|
37525|A monster wearing wizard's garb has blocked the path.|
37526|The atmosphere is filled with death and the smell is starting to condense.|
37527|Cult Leader: Hey! What makes you think you can go see Von?|
37528|Once their leader has succumbed, the rest of the cult will cave in as well.|
37529|Warren Dix sacrificed all his believers and resurrected!|
37530|The cult leader has become very weak. Hurry and give him the final blow!|
37531|Isai is busy battling Von!|
37532|Isai is not doing so well. We have to rush to her side immediately.|
37533|???: Warren Dix, you've worked really hard, my son.|
37534|Von: "Come on. Let's play!"|
37535|Von: "Sorry, hero, but the real Von is in another castle. This was just one of my many avatars."|
37536|You've finally reared your ugly head!|
37537|Isai: "Are you alright?"|
37538|Some of the revelers seemed to be possessed by malevolent spirits.|
37539|The cultists seem to have gone entirely mad deep within the cellars, although it is unclear how they came to be that way.|
37540|Just as the Secret Treasure comes into view, you are caught off guard by a shrill screech.|
37541|Yumikaze "Not so fast! I saw this trinket first!"|
37542|Yumikaze "It is my solemn duty to retrieve this. Now, step aside!"|
37543|Yumikaze "Have it your way, then. Don't say I didn't warn you!"|
37544|Zephyrine "Wait just a minute! I was here first! Everyone just back off!"|
37545|A large cloth with two glinting eyes folded in on itself and morphed into Zephyrine!|
37546|Zephyrine "You know what? Let's take care of this guy together!"|
37547|Zephyrine "..."|
37548|Master has commanded me to wreak havoc everywhere!|
37549|I won't let you take even the sightliest sniff near the Holy Sword! Time to die!|
37550|A heated stream of air came from the ground.|
37551|Alex: "Partner, are you alright?"|
37552|Alex: "Let's join forces to beat them!"|
37553|The Winged Duke has spread his toxicity all around this cave. He's so mean!|
37554|Their memories still linger in my mind. Defeating them would be also some kind of redemption.|
37555|Diavolo: [Rage...hatred...] [undefined]|
37556|Diavolo, one of the first Guardian Sprite, fell into disgrace and is currently lashing out in a frenzy.|
37557|Alanome: Envoy of Gaia, your presence helped Loki realize he's not completely blind.|
37558|Alanome: Get out of my sight, quickly!|
37559|Awaydas: Odum, why are you in such a hurry? Do you miss your brother that much?|
37560|Awaydas: Well, then get prepared to be absorbed so you can meet him again!|
37561|Isai disappeared into thin air, how did he do it?!|
37562|Alanome summoned lots of Fire Circles. Get away! They cause burn DMG.|
37563|You must get rid of Alanome's clones before facing her in combat.|
37564|Awaydas summoned Para Ryan's wisp Be careful.|
37565|The bodies of a guardian and a demon are lying on the ground. It looks like they fought a fierce battle.|
37566|After defeating the devil, the Holy Temple was restored to peace.|
37567|When I came here, I felt a strong evil that enveloped the entire temple. It left me a little breathless.|
37568|As the Secret Treasure appeared there was a bright flash and a red light streaked from the sky.|
37569|Dante: "Stop, someone like you doesn't deserve that treasure!"|
37570|Dante: "Only the strong are worthy to carry it."|
37571|Dante: "Get out of my sight, or I'll make you disappear!"|
37572|A beautifully slender woman descends the stairs from the sky.|
37573|Harmonia: "What a beautiful piece of treasure, may I have it?"|
37574|Harmonia: "Everyone loves a bit of treasure."|
37575|Harmonia: "If you don't give it to me, I'll have to punish you!"|
37576|Sheep Whistle: It's the humans! They're here to count us again!|
37577|Sheep Whistle: Quickly, report to the king. We must protect the village!|
37578|The sleeping sheep are dreaming about the horrible humans again.|
37579|These two seem to be whispering secrets, they look like they're up to no good.|
37580|I'm so sorry... Sorry... We're wrong.|
37581|Forgive us! We were possessed by ghosts.|
37582|Damn you humans, how dare you disturb us!|
37583|Down with humans!|
37584|I'll take you all on!|
37585|Get out!|
37586|I'll haunt your dreams!|
37587|For the sheep!|
37588|Sheep Whistle: Don't even think about trying to count us.|
37589|Why does this sheep seem so hostile toward humans?|
37590|As you start to take a nap, the sheep start to jump...|
37591|Every night, like clockwork.|
37592|The sheep keep jumping until the humans fall asleep...|
37593|Tell the humans to stop counting!|
37594|I believe I'm...|
37595|Falling asleep...|
37596|Say goodbye... To insomnia...|
37597|Why must the humans always count us at night?|
37598|Don't be upset.|
37599|Looks like the sheep are tired of being counted by humans trying to fall asleep... It must be annoying to be counted every night.|
37600|An angry sheep is rushing toward you.|
37601|Hello, human! I didn't expect to see one of you here.|
37602|This is where your path ends!|
37603|I'll let my Sheep Brother deal with you.|
37604|Otherworld - Candetonn Hill has been restored to peace through your efforts!|
37605|Blast it! Can I finally sleep... |
37606|Sleepy Sheep Sister: I never thought you humans would do this!|
37607|This must end here; my Sheep Sister will stop you.|
37608|I just want a little bit of sleep...|
37609|Anery: Damn you humans, what have you done to my children!?|
37610|You may have defeated them, but you won't defeat us!|
37611|Feel the wrath of the angry herd!|
37612|Wow... Am I old now... |
37613|Partner... I will leave you first.|
37614|A dark aura rushes towards you as the Secret Treasure appears.|
37615|A pleasant piano chiming surrounds you as the Secret Treasure appears.|
37616|Upon entering the castle, you instantly sense a strong demonic power.|
37617|The priests are gathering their magic. Hurry and stop them!|
37618|The fallen angel is burning away his own life force in order to provide magical energy.|
37619|The deeper you venture into the castle, the more oppressive it is.|
37620|How annoying. A bunch of termites seem to have chewed their way into my castle.|
37621|If you're brave enough to come to such a place, you must be equally prepared to die as well.|
37622|Loki: Give all of your power to me!|
37623|Those without any use here, get out of my sight!|
37624|Treasure Trove|
37625|After crossing the threshold, you sense a strong, familiar power... |
37626|Keep a watchful eye on the Ablaze Earthfire. They engulf all they touch in flames.|
37627|The entire place is filled with Ablaze Earthfire. There might also be secret contraptions. Be extra careful.|
37628|You proceed with confusion upon seeing the corpses of soldiers strewn about the floor... |
37629|You're well aware of what lies ahead. |
37630|One doesn't need a reason to vanquish evil, but... Is he truly evil?|
37631|The Holy Sword emits a sinister residue, a foul aura that continues to spread... |
37632|Isai emerges from the turbid miasma.|
37633|Isai, "So... It cannot be stopped after all..."|
37634|Isai, "Perhaps this is my true destiny..."|
37635|The sounds of soldiers fighting out front reaches your ears.|
37636|Merciless flames descend from the sky...|
37637|The elite warriors of the Makar are dispatching the monsters with ease...|
37638|A wicked laugh echoes up from the ravine.|
37639|A colorful ball rolls out, and a girl appears.|
37640|Zashi, "Oooh! What a pretty Treasure Chest! I want it, I want it!"|
37641|Zashi, "Why don't you give it to me for being so cute?"|
37642|Zashi, "I'll get angry if you don't!"|
37643|A girl appears on stage under a dazzling spotlight.|
37644|Muse, "Everyone's favorite idol is here!"|
37645|Muse, "Um, who are you?" This Treasure Chest is a gift from my beloved fans!"|
37646|Muse, "Please let go and stay in line if you want my autograph!"|
37647|The instant the sword is inserted, the altar unleashes a powerful magic...|
37648|A loud noise from the hallway points to some sort of mechanism being activated!|
37649|The Giant Statue continues to pour out powerful magic...|
37650|???: "Who...has woken me..."|
37651|???: "This is...the smell...of evil..."|
37652|???: "Begone! This is no place for demons to run wild!"|
37653|???: "Most intriguing... I sense a familiar power within you."|
37654|???: "It is the Power of Gaia! The root of evil!"|
37655|???: "I have witnessed far too many succumb to the temptation of this force..."|
37656|???: "I...cannot believe I lost..."|
37657|???: "A battle after waiting for so long... Feels good..."|
37658|The Ancient Brave Spirit turns to dust and is carried away in the breeze.|
37659|You have freed the Ancient Brave Spirit. Return to Gloomy Ridge and inform Laster.|
37660|Come out! You bunch of stupid, idle pigs! What a lazy bunch!|
37661|Sadina summons a Demonic Priest.|
37662|Several Blazing Flowers burst forth from the ground.|
37663|The Undamaged Blazing Flower possesses the ability to heal Artemor and bolster his defenses.|
37664|Artemor summons his clone to join the fight.|
37665|With a flap of Sadina's wings, the surrounding temperature starts to drop.|
37666|Hahahaha! This place already belongs to me!|
37667|Stronger... I want to become even stronger! Bwahaha!|
37668|Let all the mindless worms come to meet their end!|
37669|It's...it's her! Lady Sadina!|
37670|Infected by Miasma, the animals here have all transformed into monsters.|
37671|The temperature drops even further as you press onward.|
37672|Contrary to the low temperature from earlier, this place is unbearably hot.|
37673|Artemor is staring at someone.|
37674|Karev: We will be responsible for suppressing the Miasma. Please! Be careful!|
37675|Brooger's body falls with the last of the lightning, the Lightning Barricade him disappearing.|
37676|The Miasma in front disappears with Kellers, opening up a path.|
37677|The flames on the bridge suddenly disappear as if inviting you to move forward.|
37678|The entire forest is teeming with restlessness. Go check it out with Yahrune.|
37679|The challenge begins! Wake the Capybara before time runs out. The sooner you succeed, the greater the rewards!|
37680|Exceeding the specified time will result in reduced Treasure Chest rewards!|
37681|The Capybara moved a little, but it's going to need more hits!|
37682|The Capybara's eyes are slightly open. Hurry up and increase the hitting speed!|
37683|The Capybara is waking up! Quickly, time to give it your all!|
37684|Excellent! The Capybara is finally awake!|
37685|The Egg Thief Chickens are flocking out! Use the corresponding color skill to keep them at bay!|
37686|Bubbly: Here come the foul fowl! Help me fight them off!|
37687|You managed to successfully guard Bubbly's Dragon Egg. The Egg Thief Chickens are retreating!|
37688|More than five Egg Thief Chickens have entered the Stone Circle. Treasure Chest rewards have been reduced!|
37689|More than five Egg Thief Chickens have entered the Stone Circle. Treasure Chest rewards have been reduced!|
37690|The Egg Thief Chickens are slowing their attacks. Get ready for the next wave!|
37691|Apples, apples, many many apples~|
37692|We want more apples! Come catch us!|
37693|We need to eat a lot of apples to not be caught!|
37694|Avoid the Tanuki. Use Skill to stop Civet from eating apples, then catch it!|
37695|You accidentally hit 3 or more Tanuki, Treasure Chest Rewards decreased!|
37696|You accidentally hit 5 or more Tanuki, Treasure Chest Rewards decreased!|
37697|Eidolon Hide And Seek starts! A few Eidolons appeared on the map, find them!|

37699|Serena's Bunny: Let's do the next challenge!|
37700|Serena's Bunny: Congratulations! Eidolon Hide And Seek complete!|
37701|Eidolons are here again! Take a photo with your favourite Eidolon!|
37702|Beacon: Otherworld Travelers agreed to meet me at the Altar ahead. Go!|
37703|Destroy the Holy Spring at the Garden of Holy Spring to the left of the temple.|
37704|Frederic Guards: Stop the traitors!|
37705|Frederic Guards: They can't pass here!|
37706|Dante: Once the Holy Spring is destroyed, the World Tree can't recover.|
37707|Head to where the World Tree is, from the atrium on the right of the temple.|
37708|Shut up, trash.|
37709|A bunch of hypocrites, you finally show your real faces.|
37710|Bring that enthusiastic idiot too... Before that, let's destroy this place.|
37711|Destroy the Holy Spring first, that's the only way to stop the World Tree from recovering.|
37712|Uzuriel, the Heavenly Defender...|
37713|Your righteousness is blindness. You can't see your own corruption.|
37714|Foul, impure creature! How dare such a worm approach me?|
37715|Once I destroy this Holy Spring, the World Tree will never recover.|
37716|Then it's the World Tree...|
37717|Michaela, do you want to stop me too?|
37718|A white-wing like you can never understand what we've been through.|
37719|Please remember, I never disrespected you, and I never belittled you for having black wings.|
37720|¡K¡K|
37721|Sorry...|
37722|If we destroy the World Tree, and take that fool away...|
37723|Uriel, our names are on the target list.|
37724|Those hypocrites are afraid of us. No matter what, black and white cannot coexist.|
37725|Do you really hold such radical beliefs?|
37726|Pff. Then you deserve no kindness, and I must name you enemy.|
37727|What a passionate fool... I will save you a spot in the New World.|
37728|I will wait for you to realize and find me... Uriel...|
37729|Uzuriel enters "Righteous Decision".|
37730|Executor: Prepare to die, traitor! No offense to executor!|
37731|Enter the Holy Spring, and use Holy Spring Destruction to destroy it.|
37732|Use Barrier Stone Transform to change all Barrier Stones to Destroy status.|
37733|Uriel enters Burst of Potential status.|
37734|Saruel is casting Doomsday Blazing Fire.|
37735|Uriel: Dante! I cannot allow you to continue with your evil any longer!|
37736|50 pieces of wood were collected. A slight vibration can be felt through the floor. The number of guards increases and they become agitated.|
37737|100 pieces of wood were collected. An unusual sound can be heard coming from the forest, and is accompanied by a violent shaking.|
37738|(Cringe!)|
37739|(Calm!)|
37740|(Cheeky!)|
37741|(Bewildered!)|
37742|Entry forbidden to this area.|
37743|There are many wild animals and demons lurking within this wilderness...|
37744|Watch out! There seem to be demons up ahead!|
37745|Watch out! The next wave of demons is coming!|
37746|<Wilderness Overlord> Amis! Go forward and defeat him.|
37747|<Wilderness Overlord> Amis is up ahead!|
37748|After you toss the coin, a long-haired maiden suddenly appears in the lake...|
37749|You tell the maiden about Marley's wish...|
37750|There appears to be an orb of light ahead. Go and take a look!|
37751|Do you long to be rich? I can grant you your wish.|
37752|Avoid the forest guards and collect wood.|
37753|Twilight Fairies suddenly appear everywhere.|
37754|When the Twilight Fairies reach the magic coffin, they sacrifice themselves to strengthen the seal.|
37755|After creating 50 units of pollution, the seal begins to dissipate, and the sounds of the Sprite's footsteps quicken.|
37756|After creating 100 units of pollution, with only a small amount of its power left, the Sprites guard the seal.|
37757|Watch out for the noxious green mist ahead...|
37758|Find a way to shut off the poisonous mist.|
37759|Deal with all of the Dark Crystal Stones to impede Idelan's recovery.|
37760|Take out the Guardian Demon Soldiers on either side to dissipate the toxic gas in the second zone.|
37761|Watch out for the Undead Society wandering the area for a new host.|
37762|A sound can be heard from deep within the Dark Abyss.|
37763|The flames of Pandemonium have been extinguished. Continue onward.|
37764|One day in Pandemonium for several hundred years in the human realm...|
37765|Thank you, Reid...|
37766|I'm sorry...|
37767|Giant Beast: I can think of no finer place for a hermitage.|
37768|Giant Beast: But first, all of the creatures blocking the way need to be dealt with.|
37769|Mysterious Plea for Help: Help! Please, someone get me out of here!|
37770|It sounds as if it's coming from that rock face. Your conscience halts you in your tracks.|
37771|Breaking through the rock reveals a cave.|
37772|Bulaken's resilience is nothing to sneeze at, so make good use of that scalding magma. Just be careful not to turn the burn on yourself.|
37773|Look at Sabaten summon those worker spiders. Put your skills to good use and interrupt him.|
37774|Upon hearing the cry for help, you immediately fly to the cave.|
37775|You grab Zion and fly straight for Zagu's location.|
37776|Giant Beast: The mouth of the cave is just over there. I'll head in and have a look.|
37777|Giant Beast Argus: This dampness... There's got to be a cave behind those rocks.|
37778|Eliminate the Venomous Spider guarding the pantry and save Zion.|
37779|Sabalen's body is plush and adorned with scales. Make good use of your unlimited skills.|
37780|Giant Beast Argus: I can think of no finer place for a hermitage.|
37781|The Snake Venom Array hasn't been eliminated, and the Snake Venom is still present. Forcing my way through isn't a good idea.|
37782|Kusanagi's call resounds from the depths of the Abyss. Follow the lights forward.|
37783|Kusanagi... Kusanagi... Come to me...|
37784|Deadly snake venom glistens in streaks along walls of the passageway. Clear a path by finding and taking out the Snake Demon Array.|
37785|Looks like we'll need to defeat those giant snakes to get through.|
37786|Have you heard Kusanagi's story?|
37787|Stop and listen to the tale.|
37788|Draw forth the force by stepping inside the circle. Five players must obtain Glimmer Protection to continue.|
37789|But be wary of the Nightmare Spiderlings. Three is enough to contaminate the circle and eject you from the dream.|
37790|Jion: If I were you, I'd take turns to draw Glimmer Protection. I sincerely wish you the best of luck.|
37791|A Nightmare Spiderling has contaminated the light circle, causing a fluctuation of sorts to occur around the Dream Stone Tablet.|
37792|Even more Nightmare Spiderlings are drawn in after a team member successfully obtains the Glimmer Protection.|
37793|You were successful... Descend deeper into dreamland.|
37794|A third Nightmare Spiderling has invaded the Glimmer Protection circle, triggering the dream's own defensive mechanism.|
37795|You're hit with a bout of dizziness before being ejected from the dream.|
37796|Hey! What the hell are these? Such foul flavor!|
37797|You can all go get lost in dreamland. Ugh. I can't believe you're making us drink this!|
37798|Hee-hee... Time's up, and you still haven't finished.|
37799|You can all go get lost in dreamland. Move it, slowpoke!|
37800|Use the platform in the air to collect 5 scattered Energy Keys.|
37801|The keys are quite heavy, so you won't be able to jump once you've collected them. Remember to choose your target wisely.|
37802|After obtaining an Energy Key, use it on the Goddess Statue to reenergize it.|
37803|The next step... I can't keep up.|
37804|I only ask that you... save Daphne... my most precious treasure...|
37805|Jion: This Happiness Energy...is my last...|
37806|This space is overflowing with Happiness Energy. Collect it to attack the Evl Nightmare!|
37807|The Sleepwalker has appeared! Hurry up and knock him down to get a Nightmare Protection Shield.|
37808|The Nightmare Purifier appeared! More about carefully and switch on the purifier.|
37809|Some people not protected by the barrier descended into nightmare.|
37810|The purifier cleanses the area of the nightmare and Happiness Energy gradually takes its place.|
37811|More than three players have fallen into nightmare, and the Glimmer Protection is no longer able to protect you.|
37812|Ha ha ha! I won't let you go!|
37813|Mysterious Voice: Heh heh heh... No matter how eager you are to get out here, you must not forget to report the quest! Or do you want to solve it again?|
37814|The toolbox contains cords of rope commonly used by miners.|
37815|Tuka, who had fainted to the side, has woken up. Beware of his noise.|
37816|Stefan: Brother... I crave your death!|
37817|The fierce fighting causes unstables the mine's already unable rock walls to collapse.|
37818|Rockslides are strong enough to break through Tychon's outer shell.|
37819|Lang: That damned bug...is all your fault!|
37820|Exterminate a certain number of Ore-Eating Snails to put a stop to Lang's state.|
37821|Hiding beside the rockslide and out of its path, you're able to avoid the damage that Lang cannot.|
37822|You slowly open you eyes to find yourself in a totally unfamiliar place.|
37823|Chimera: What is this place? Wh-who am I?|
37824|Watch it with those flames!|
37825|Chimera: Hey! You have to go there, now!|
37826|The gate is protected by powerful forces, and the guards must be eliminated.|
37827|Mysterious Voice: Amazing! This might actually work!|
37828|The gate opens, and Fester quickly catches up.|
37829|Quickly, destroy the Gate Control Switch.|
37830|Alarm: Attention! Enemy invasion! Attention! Enemy invasion!|
37831|You sense an unusually powerful force surrounding the enemy before you.|
37832|You sense a shift in the air in the Despair Mine.|
37833|Stepping into the Despair Mine, an odd sensation inundates your body as your aura fluctuates.|
37834|The Winged Duke hurls a series of spells, leaving you stunned as everything fades to black.|
37835|The reach the passage leading out.|
37836|All of the gates are open. Go back and tell Endora.|
37837|Exterminate a certain number of Ore-Eating Snails to put a stop to Lang's state.|
37838|This is... the Fire of Titan's Chaos Flame!|
37839|I serve the life of the Father. I'm looking for the long-lost Fire of Titan.|
37840|Who would have thought it would be hiding in this unassuming cave...|
37841|It's a good think Uncle blessed my armor with the strength of the sea.|
37842|That's the only way I was able to resist the heat from the Chaos Flame.|
37843|Hurry and find the Fire of Titan!|
37844|Not even the blessing of the sea can stop it...|
37845|There's no way I'll be able to handle that...|
37846|Surrender, Fire of Titan!|
37847|If you don't, I'll send you back to see the Father.|
37848|Hmph! So disrespectful to your elders.|
37849|I'll never bend to that old man's will again.|
37850|A frightening roar emits from the cave up ahead.|
37851|... Titans never surrender!|
37852|Milo is waiting for help. Quick, help him!|
37853|Following the instructions on the Skillet,|
37854|choose the right ingredients from the food box and place them in the pot.|
37855|Advance to the next stage with Milo!|
37856|Prepare the meals that the customer wants...|
37857|Serve the meal once you're ready!|
37858|Watch out... Don't serve the wrong orders!|
37859|Give Me Takoyaki! Right now!|
37860|Give Me Cotton Candy! Right now!|
37861|Give Me A Crepe! Right now!|
37862|Give Me Cake! Right now!|
37863|Give Me Black Coffee! Right now!|
37864|Follow Milo to the next level using the Portal!|
37865|Enter the maze to find the five legendary ingredients and bring them out to Milo!|
37866|You've already opened a Legendary Treasure Chest. You do not have enough energy to open another.|
37867|Advance to the final stage with Milo!|
37868|Protect five large Skillets from the Demanding Customers' attacks.|
37869|Finally! The cooking is done! The festival ended successfully!|
37870|Sigh... Winning the celebration was not an easy task...|
37871|Lots of Restless Eagles are heading towards Idun!|
37872|The Restless Eagles can't be driven away until they stop somewhere!|
37873|Go into the Halo to gain the ability to stop the Restless Eagles!|
37874|5 minutes until Idun wakes up. We need to protect her from being frightened by the Restless Eagles!|
37875|Just 2 more minutes!|
37876|Just 1 more minute!|
37877|Lots of eagles are swooping across the field. Be careful!|
37878|Some Restless Eagles are faster. You better watch out.|
37879|You failed to protect Idun. She fainted from fear again.|
37880|This time, we'll protect Idun well.|
37881|Getting hit will be really painful.|
37882|Please avoid the Toxic Dragon Territory at the foot of Offnir...|
37883|Gather the World Twilight under the World Tree Sapling...|
37884|Making the most of the World Twilight will help Idun turn the tables...|
37885|The orb is giving off a strange glow. This is...|
37886|Warning! Warning! Warning!|
37887|Barry: Everyone, please leave the Sky Tower immediately! Tower... of...|
37888|Barry's message was interrupted...|
37889|A powerful unknown energy shook the Sky Tower...|
37890|Choose your own destiny! Envoys of Gaia!|
37891|A Restless Eagle is approaching Idun!|
37892|There are Little Firefoxes south of the Snowflake Hamlet, hunt them down!|
37893|There are Woodland Foxes east of the Snowflake Hamlet, go hunt them down!|
37894|There are Tundra Foxes north of the Snowflake Hamlet, go hunt them down!|
37895|The Snowy Fox left after eating the Peach Pies...|
37896|In the distance, a cat's laughter can be heard...|
37897|A Cheshire Cat sits up ahead. It's been waiting for you for a long time...|
37898|Go and see what's written on the Wall Inscription!|
37899|Time's up! Failed to advance...|
37900|Try harder next time!|
37901|The Cheshire Cat flew off...|
37902|The Cheshire Cat flies around excitedly... It looks like you're about to succeed!|
37903|Attracted by the smell, the Orange Tanuki emerges suddenly...|
37904|The thorns have disappeared! The Cheshire Cat flies forward with excitement...|
37905|It looks like there's a Snowy Fox to the northeast...|
37906|People have seen a trembling Snow Elk north of the Snowflake Hamlet, go find it!|
37907|Congratulations! You answered incorrectly!|
37908|Three Tanuki appear in front of the altar...|
37909|As you enter the Hidden Crystals Cave, you feel a sense of fear, sadness, and anger rush towards you. |
37910|As you enter the Ancestral Spirits Temple, you feel a powerful magic... |
37911|A rainbow colored apple appears in front of you, and an adorable little princess emerges from within.|
37912|Lumikki: "Hmm? Where are all the Dwarves hiding?"|
37913|Lumikki: "Wow! This treasure chest is so beautiful! Is everyone hiding inside?"|
37914|Lumikki: "I've been looking for them for a long time. Could you please give me this treasure chest?"|
37915|Surrounded by dazzling lightnings, a teenage boy appears.|
37916|Tyr: "As a member of the family, I'll do my best this time!"|
37917|Tyr: "This Treasure Chest... Does it have anything to do with my quest? Just leave it to me!"|
37918|Tyr: "Me! Heroic Glory Tyr! There is nothing I want that I can't get!"|
37919|Believer Chick: You're new! Let's praise the Magic Chick together!|
37920|Believer Chick: Wait... He's not a chicken! Go tell big brother!|
37921|A strange baby chick appears on the prairie.|
37922|Ever since I started to believe in the Magic Chick, I've been thinking as fast as a computer!|
37923|Wow! You're practically glowing!|
37924|The Magic Chick is great! Praise the Magic Chick!|
37925|These chicks seem to believe in the Magic Chick.|
37926|Come! Help me with this beautiful dance.|
37927|From the left hand!|
37928|To the right hand!|
37929|Then jump!|
37930|The Magic Chick is awesome!|
37931|The chicks really worship the Magic Chick. Who is this Magic Chick?|
37932|I've been eating fresh vegetables and fruits every day and doing sports regularly ever since I started to believe in the Magic Chick.|
37933|Not only do I get stronger and more energetic, I also get full marks in every exam!|
37934|Praise the Magic Chick!|
37935|The Magic Chick is amazing!|
37936|But all is the Magic Chick's doing!|
37937|A special chicken has appeared at the center of the prairie.|
37938|I am the great Legendary Chick!|
37939|Lost lambs... No, lost chicks!|
37940|Follow my guidance!|
37941|Wait... You're not a chicken!|
37942|Remember to...eat three meals regularly...and exercise every day.|
37943|Defeat the Believer Chicks to remove the Magic Chick's shield!|
37944|Thanks to your efforts, peace has been restored in Otherworld - Ventos Prairie!|
37945|Electronic Chick: How dare you bully the Magic Chick Lord!|
37946|I'll take you down!|
37947|Gu... Gugu, short... Short circuit.|
37948|Dancing Chick: Can't you understand how great the Magic Chick is?|
37949|Here, let me teach you.|
37950|Oh dear! I think I've sprained my foot...|
37951|Avocado Chick: I didn't expect you to be so stubborn.|
37952|Then let me tell you how great the Magic Chick is!|
37953|Great Magic Chick! Please grant me magical power!|
37954|As you enter Bloodthirsty Castle, you feel your aura changing and transforming...|
37955|Reeky: My gem... Damn!|
37956|You need to get close to a crystal with the same red aura to remove the red aura.|
37957|You'll be infected by the scent of my blood and you will soon become my companion.|
37958|Greedy fools, you will all join my blood clan!|
37959|Watch out for the Dead Land!|
37960|Avoid the Bloodthirsty Evil Bats. If you're bitten, you'll be sucked dry.|
37961|You feel the aura in Bloodthirsty Castle change, and you enter a different state.|
37962|The elders said... I had to prove myself through the trials to prove I am a true Tiger...|
37963|Boohoo... I'm a little scared...|
37964|But the Elders said if I can't do it, then...|
37965|Once this spell is cast, everyone will come to me...|
37966|Let's try it! I am very strong!!|
37967|Find and investigate the Tablet. Follow the instructions and complete the trials.|
37968|Boohoo... It's a bear! What should I do? I should go home...|
37969|But... If I run away at the first trial, everyone will laugh at me...|
37970|Boohoo... Right! Right! The Tablet says that if I leave, the image will disappear!|
37971|If I can't win, I will run...That's it!|
37972|"You have reached the edge of the trial zone... If you keep moving forward, the image will disappear..."|
37973|"... Since you have proven your strength, I will offer you my blessing."|
37974|Wow... Did I... Did I win?|
37975|If I could defeat such a beast... I guess the next trial shouldn't be hard!|
37976|The mechanism has calmed down and stops working.|
37977|"... You have proven your wisdom, and I hereby give you my blessing."|
37978|That should be the last Tablet...|
37979|The trial is almost over! Hurry up!|
37980|"You, who accepted the trials, must now prove yourself and show your courage!"|
37981|Boohoo.. Fire on one side and water on the other... What should I do?...|
37982|??: "..Listen... Just destroy... Stop... the birth."|
37983|Hmm...? What's that sound? It sounds broken...|
37984|...It feels strange... Let's check it out first...|
37985|Yes, it's a Skeleton! What is it doing here?|
37986|Find the Tablet... Destroy...|
37987|What? Are they going to destroy the Tablet?|
37988|What? What should I do? I am scared... I have to call the Elders!|
37989|I will use the amulet, that's it... But I don't know when they will arrive... Boohoo...|
37990|I have to do it! I have to stop them!|
37991|??: "Kitami? Look at your hair... You're still too weak, huh?..."|
37992|You had the bad luck to meet me during the trial. You will not survive!|
37993|Boohoo... Everyone will be here soon! Before...|
37994|You... You shall not pass! I won't let you!|
37995|Shortly after the Deadstone General was defeated, the Elders arrived with a group of tigers.|
37996|Kitami speaks softly about what happened and admits having failed the Courage Trial.|
37997|"... Foolish child, you can always ask for help and stop them..."|
37998|"...You have proven your courage, and I offer you my blessing."|
37999|The Dungeon contains a stage that requires an item to pass. Please make sure you have space for at least 2 items in your backpack.|
38000|Legendary Gaia Fireworks explode in the sky, leaving beautiful sparks behind.|
38001|Legendary Azuria fireworks explode into the sky, leaving beautiful sparks behind.|
38002|Legendary Fantasy Fireworks explode into the sky, leaving beautiful sparks behind.|
38003|I heard a sweet sound... Where did it come from?|
38004|Is that your voice? It's like the sweetest of bells...|
38005|Hehe! I have another gift!|
38006|Meow! It's a yarn ball!|
38007|Whew...I'm so happy! I think I've been playing for too long...The trial, the trial...|
38008|Meow, it's so beautiful!|
38009|It'll be even more beautiful tonight. I'll add it to my collection!|
38010|Meow! Today I've got some awesome stuff! Participating in this trial is not so bad after all...|
38011|Service Broadcast, Service Broadcast. Envoy of Gaia, please visit the entrance service center.|
38012|Someone at the entrance service center is looking for you. Go find out what's happening.|
38013|Can you be more careful? It almost spilled on me!|
38014|No water left... Go get some.|
38015|Water is loaded! Go to the Bob-a-Ball Stand!|
38016|...Pain... Ouch...|
38017|Here... Yes... Where?|
38018|You wake up in a strange valley, behind you is a gate that smells of evil. The air is so heavy it feels dreadful.|
38019|Under intense pain, you hear the sound of cries and singing off in the distance.|
38020|A Harpy singing an ominous tune blocks your way.|
38021|The song stops, but the pain remains. Go find a way out of here.|
38022|The crimson Golem seems to be breaking out from the ground.|
38023|The road ahead is blocked by unbearable heat.|
38024|The Golem has fallen. The wounds torn open during battle are burning. Leave this place now.|
38025|A heavy aura descends, and the path out is interrupted again.|
38026|Really?.. You still want to go on living... Brave child.|
38027|Even though it's painful and difficult, one day you'll find your salvation.|
38028|The space here seems to be twisted. And there is an ominous aura. Could there be other exits?|
38029|A heavy aura radiates from all around... You've arrived at another dimension...|
38030|You seem to be pulled out of Guzigla's consciousness. Is this another memory of the Guzigla?|
38031|Investigate the other Wisps.|
38032|You suddenly feel a severe headache when you touch the Blood Curse...|
38033|Someone's memories suddenly fill your mind.|
38034|Investigate the surrounding Wisps.|
38035|In the Sanguine Center, sealed Guzigla groans bitterly...|
38036|After witnessing all of this, it's like you've been forced out of this space, as if this memory had driven you away.|
38037|Consciousness has returned to Guzigla. The fissure just disappeared... Let's go.|
38038|Something has happened to the Sanguine Center. Go check it out.|
38039|Be careful while you're on your way. Avoid any spills from collisions.|
38040|A list of food was written on the paper and then crossed out. Only the words "Cotton Candy" can be seen on it...|
38041|A list of food was written on the paper and then crossed out. Only the words "Takoyaki" can be seen on it...|
38042|A list of food was written on the paper and then crossed out. Only the words "Buckwheat Noodles" can be seen on it...|
38043|Thank you! You know what I want to eat! You're the best courier!|
38044|You must answer the questions correctly and break through the Demon Egg.|
38045|Correct! The Green Demon Egg has been destroyed!|
38046|Correct! The Purple demon egg has been destroyed!|
38047|Correct! The Red Demon Egg has been destroyed!|
38048|All the Demon Eggs have been killed. Advance successful!|
38049|A meteor hits! Failed to advance!|
38050|One minute has passed!|
38051|Two minutes have passed!|
38052|Last ten seconds!|
38053|Challenge successful! Please proceed to the final round!|
38054|Finally! The Cheshire Cat cheers from behind...|
38055|Ches: I knew you could!|
38061|You're attracted to the vortex and you're in the downstream.|
38062|Don't you know that you've gone deep into the cave, and when you see the Holy Light, you've gone outside the mine.|
38063|You explore deep inside the mine and see a huge monster outside the cave.|
38064|After you put down the bouquet at the Tombstone, you hear someone walking towards you.|
38065|You find a place to hide and confirm that they are Julien and Hayden.|
38066|You've messed up the steps and the Alchemy Pot exploded...|
38067|Lamia: I've written it so clearly. How can you still mess it up?|
38068|The Alchemy Kettle emits a faint Holy Light, you feel a divine aura..|
38069|Lamia: Wow, you're not that bad! I'll take the nutritional supplement!|
38070|Violet made you dress up as her to attract the criminal...|
38071|Keep up Violet's appearance and follow the Holy Light.|
38072|Looks like the criminal is on the hook...|
38073|Keep moving forward to lure him onto the bridge. There's no way he can escape!|
38074|You've reached the other side of the bridge. You've removed the disguise...|
38075|"Why, how could it be you?"|
38076|You rush forward to stop him...|
38077|You decide to give the prisoner a chance to defend themself.|
38078|The Rabbit Bandit is competing against the humans in the preliminary competition! Start!|
38079|The Humans won the first match!|
38080|The Rabbit Soldier will compete humans in the semi-final! Start!|
38081|Victory! The Humans have won again!|
38082|The Rabbit Captain will be competing the Humans in the Finals! Start!|
38083|What? The Rabbit Captain lost!|
38084|You've taken a very good picture of the Holy Tree. Take it to Laree!|
38085|For some reason, your hook is stuck within a hole in a coin...|
38086|The fishing line has been caught by Waterweeds. It took you a long time to unhook them.|
38087|The lively lobster flies out of the water with the fishing hook, and the fishing rod became useless.|
38088|The sobbing sound fades away, Hayden and Julien seem to have left.|
38089|Thanks to your efforts, this has come to an end.|
38090|Gurgle gurgle gurgle... Eirene loves the quiet sound of flowing water!|
38091|The sound of flowing water seems to be mixed with a loud roar, coming from that direction.|
38092|That sound seems to come from right ahead, made by some Boar and Giants.|
38093|Everyone! Instead of waiting to die of hunger, let's fight the boar!|
38094|Sigh... It looks like I'm going to become some boar food today...|
38095|Kill! Don't worry, Boar, we'll eat you all!|
38096|I'll just pretend to be busy...|
38097|A Boar has appeared! Help the Giants defeat it.|
38098|Eirene has helped the Giants to defeat the Boar, and they are grateful to her...|
38099|Soon after, Eirene has returned to her peaceful Flowing Water Cave...|
38100|Eirene notices the sound of flowing water is mixed with some sighs, and she is going to find out what's going on.|
38101|There seems to be a troubled Farmer up ahead. You can talk to him!|
38102|You hear some noises up ahead, including some similar sound made by the Giants!|
38103|Wow! So many people! What's up here?|
38104|Ask around to know what has happened.|
38105|Thank you so much! With these Cabbages, we don't need to worry about food or fighting the Giants any more.|
38106|Okanda: If there is a way to preserve food, I won't have to start a war.|
38107|Eirene: I've heard that Eternal Ice Cubes can keep food from rotting. Give me some time and I'll find some for you!|
38108|Eirene defeated Balton, obtained Eternal Ice Cubes, and handed them over to the Giants' Chief.|
38109|Balton: How dare you intrude on my territory! Are you here to die?|
38110|Balton: Ice Sprite, your attribute seems to be matching mine. I will absorb all of your energy!|
38111|The Giants' Chief has dismissed the idea of enslaving Humans, and has promised to trade peacefully with them!|
38112|Neal: For the sake of Eirene, let's first stay put and wait for her return!|
38113|I, the Immortal Talamund, have awoken from a long, deep sleep.|
38114|Those greedy, foolish humans! They have not only removed my seal but also helped spread my magic to every corner of this world...|
38115|Now, everyone must have felt panicked about the fact that they are gradually turning into monsters!|
38116|???: "Move fast! The magic is spreading from right there!"|
38117|No... It's Evil Dragon! How did you get in here?|
38118|Are these fragments... Sand Gems? So, that's why my body...|
38119|No matter what, I, Indalam the Gatekeeper, will never let you pass!|
38120|Talamund: "Heh heh... Foolish humans, you'll all fall under my dragon's power!"|
38121|Oh, I'm terribly sorry to fail you, your Majesty! Please kindly forgive me...|
38122|Talamund: "I'm your master from now on."|
38123|Talamund: "Guard well the temple gate and don't let a fly in!"|
38124|Boohoo...! Yes..., my Master.|
38125|There is a detestable divine aura... Maybe you should deal with it first when it's still weak.|
38126|That aura is surrounded by a magic barrier, it seems that you can't just go ahead and enter. Find that human who made the barrier!|
38127|Saniemi: "Hmm...Uh! ...What can I do for you, Master?"|
38128|Yakubu: "Saniemi! How's it going outside!?"|
38129|Yakubu: "Are you... that Evil Dragon? Saniemi, you..."|
38130|Talamund: "Don't worry. You'll soon be like him!"|
38131|Yakubu: "Boohoo... Sorry... I was unable to protect the Dragon of Salvation..."|
38132|Murfeo: "I swore to protect the Kingdom of Sand and this palace forever."|
38133|Murfeo: "Dragon or God, I won't let anyone pass!"|
38134|Talamund: "Hmph... I'll leave it to you to guard the palace."|
38135|Murfeo: "...Yes, my Master. No one can ever break the guard of the palace anymore."|
38136|You fly through the corridor and down into the depth of this golden palace.|
38137|Vitas: "Are you the Immortal Demon Talamund?! You'll be stopped here!"|
38138|Vitas: "I will protect this kingdom, and you will be gone forever!"|
38139|Talamund: "Vitas Sandfall... What can you do without the power of the Dragon of Salvation?"|
38140|Talamund: "I'll show you how foolish you are to challenge me."|
38141|Vitas: "Oh... You, your power, how evil and great..."|
38142|Vitas: "Even if the Sand Gem can seal you again, this disaster will definitely repeat itself..."|
38143|Vitas: "Wrenna, my child! Use your power to bring salvation to the world!"|
38144|After Saniemi sends you back to the corridor, take the sealed Dragon Egg and leave this palace with Yakubu.|
38145|A cave filled with magical energy. You can hear monsters making noises from time to time.|
38146|There seems to be powerful magic ahead...|
38147|All of a sudden, a huge shake descends from the ground.|
38148|Frost Wings: Rawr! Rawr!|
38149|The Mage defeated the Frost Wings, but the injuries are serious.|
38150|The Mage is determined to go further.|
38151|Watch out! There are lots of Frost Crystal Mushrooms lurking in the front!|
38152|Soul Hunter: Who dares to trespass here? Pay the price of their lives!|
38153|Soul Hunter: Another group of invaders. Too confident.|
38154|The path to the abyss has been opened. You feel a chill...|
38155|Monsters seem to be coming from behind!|
38156|The Mage and Carmilla seem to have survived. They seem to have found something.|
38157|Defeat Carmilla and break her ambitions!|
38158|Avoid the Frost Storm and defeat the Frost Wings.|
38159|The Evil Spirit Ice Sprite has appeared! Watch out for their self-explosive attacks!|
38160|Carmilla summons the Frost Blowing Crystals, which will last for 30 seconds. Keep an eye on them, and those that are attacked will be granted the status "Ice Frost Proverbs".|
38161|Carmilla has initiated the Frigid Zone. Watch out! Within the duration of the field, the longer the time is delayed, the more Move SPD will decrease.|
38162|The aura in the Frost Prison has changed. You have entered a different state.|
38163|The Frost Wings have gone into a state of decay! Attack it!|
38164|Split failed.|
38165|David looks very anxious. Hurry up and help him!|
38166|Take the mallet from the crate next to you|
38167|Punish the Mischievous Grass Sprite for pranking!|
38168|The Grass Sprites are feeling pain and running away...|
38169|You leave the camera lying quietly on the ground...|
38170|Continue to accompany David to the next stage!|
38171|Protect David and the food when David cooks,|
38172|don't let the rabbit enter the Large Urn!|
38173|There are many ancient artifacts here...|
38174|Find the energy and give it to David!|
38175|After a series of supplements...The camera is finally working!|
38176|The Totem's aura is suffocating...|
38177|In order for David to be able to take a photo...|
38178|try to solve the mystery of the totem!|
38179|The aura seems to become less...|
38180|Finally! Shoot complete!|
38181|To take a picture...Come back when you're ready...|

40001|#824$#Are you starting to dislike me?|
40002|#824$#Am I... am I too weak to be your partner?|
40003|#824$#If you don't need me, please don't summon me.|
40004|#824$#Come on, don't ignore me...|
40005|#824$#Did I disappoint you? If so, I will try to do better.|
40006|#824$#You seem a bit distant lately. Is something wrong?|
40007|#824$#Hey, I haven't seen you in a while! What've you been up to?|
40008|#824$#It just doesn't seem like I matter to you at all.|
40009|#824$#If you're upset with me, just say so.|
40010|#824$#Am I not a valuable companion to you?|
40011|#821$#So good to see you again. Let's chat, shall we?|
40012|#821$#'sup? Anything I can help you with?|
40013|#822$#What do you do when you're not out adventuring?|
40014|#821$#If you're having trouble getting through a dungeon, try bringing a few friends along!|
40015|#821$#When we have some time, we should sit down and share our thoughts.|
40016|#821$#I hate weird stuff most. Isn't it great to have an ordinary life?|
40017|#822$#I always see you alone. Wouldn't it be more interesting to go out and make some friends?|
40018|#821$#Gotta spend some time getting familiar with the village.|
40019|#822$#If you want to change your weapons, you should visit a weapon merchant. You might score some Blue-quality equipment!|
40020|#821$#I really admire those who know how to use Dual Pistols! They're a powerful weapon combination that can be used to disrupt and attack at the same time!|
40021|#821$#You chose me from among many Eidolons. That means we have a special connection, right?|
40022|#822$#The rate that you're growing at is surprising everyone.|
40023|#821$#Don't worry about my feelings. Just do what you want to do.|
40024|#821$#Now that I've seen your skills in action, I have no doubt that you're the person I want to follow.|
40025|#822$#It doesn't matter whether it's humans or Eidolons. Just trust your partner and communicate!|
40026|#822$#Just make your attack. I'll be by your side, supporting you.|
40027|#821$#Your safety is more important to me than my own life.|
40028|#822$#Whatever you ask of me, I'll definitely try my best!|
40029|#821$#I'm willing to take on any enemy with you!|
40030|#822$#I admire your good judgement!|
40031|#824$#Are you upset with me? Is that why you're so cold?|
40032|#824$#I've always felt that you think of me as a brother. I never suspected that you didn't trust me at all.|
40033|#824$#You find me annoying, don't you? Have I seen through you?|
40034|#824$#If you don't need my help, just summon some other Eidolon!|
40035|#824$#It's so hard to be straightforward with you!|
40036|#824$#You still don't seem to trust me at all...|
40037|#824$#Hemming and hawing really irritates me!|
40038|#824$#Looks like you've completely underestimated my strength...|
40039|#824$#Learn from my attacks. Your weak strikes won't do anything!|
40040|#824$#If there's anything that you're unhappy about, just say it. I welcome any kind of criticism!|
40041|#823$# Ha! Perfect timing! I was bored to death!|
40042|#821$#Hah! As long as we're together, we'll be invincible.|
40043|#821$#You look happy. Did something good happen?|
40044|#821$#Our recent opponents have been so boring... Could we find a real challenge?|
40045|#822$#Just tell me what your problem is! I will definitely help you solve it!|
40046|#821$#One day you'll definitely be as strong as I am!|
40047|#822$#Fighting is such a joy when the enemy provides a challenge!|
40048|#821$#You look pretty fresh! You must have slept pretty well yesterday!|
40049|#822$#Challenging powerful enemies every once and a while would add some spice to our daily routine.|
40050|#821$#If you want to take a vacation, please remember to tell me.|
40051|#821$#I want to find out who's stronger: you or me.|
40052|#822$#Are you envious of my perfect body? Keep working, and you can have one just like it!|
40053|#821$#I see a great strength in your eyes.|
40054|#822$#It's quite interesting to wander around with you. You have all the best enemies, haha!|
40055|#821$#Just tell me when you have any problems. I'll help you, no matter how difficult it is.|
40056|#822$#The Envoy's Path must be chosen carefully, because it will directly influence your effectiveness in combat.|
40057|#821$#If you want to pursue the ultimate defense, then fortify your armor!|
40058|#822$#You look rather happy today. Did something nice happen?|
40059|#821$#One day I will be the strongest Eidolon in the world!|
40060|#822$#You've beaten so many powerful enemies. Looks like I've underestimated you.|
40061|#824$#Look me in the eyes when you speak to me. That is basic respect.|
40062|#824$#Can I get some time to myself? I don't want to see you right now.|
40063|#824$#Try to use your brain. I know you aren't this stupid.|
40064|#824$#Think, then act. Always remember that.|
40065|#824$#Attacking carelessly will only get you killed. Please, think before acting.|
40066|#824$#No matter how refined I seem, I still have emotions.|
40067|#824$#Am I not performing up to your standards? Is that why you're so cold towards me?|
40068|#824$#Did I disappoint you? I can do better!|
40069|#824$#If there's anything that I haven't done well, please tell me a better way to do it.|
40070|#824$#Don't get complacent! A person who challenges himself constantly will grow stronger!|
40071|#822$#So good to see you! Let's chat over drinks.|
40072|#821$#You should spend more time reading. Knowledge is power, after all.|
40073|#823$#Knowledge is nothing without the imagination to use it. Don't forget that.|
40074|#823$#Looks like you haven't been outdoors in a while! Would you like to take a walk with me later?|
40075|#821$#As long as you judge your enemy with your heart, you will be able to see their flaws.|
40076|#823$#Is there anything I can do for you?|
40077|#823$#What's wrong? You seem to be a bit irritated. If you want, I'm a good listener...|
40078|#822$#It's not healthy to stay up late all the time. Please, try to go to bed earlier.|
40079|#822$#Are you having trouble? Let's sit down and talk about it.|
40080|#822$#Your leadership is the reason our battle went so well.|
40081|#821$#Make sure you maintain your equipment! If you don't take care of it, it will betray you.|
40082|#822$#You should have Secret Stones with you. Their skill-increasing ability is very helpful.|
40083|#821$#Life is unpredictable. You never know what'll happen. That's why I cherish all the moments that I have with you.|
40084|#821$#Looks like you're in a good mood today. Any interest in reading with me?|
40085|#821$#I've been practicing my mind-reading again lately. I think your mind is filled with thoughts of treasure, right?|
40086|#823$#I've been waiting forever and a day! I've got so much to tell you.|
40087|#821$#I don't like fighting, but I'll do my best to keep you safe.|
40088|#823$#With your skills, I have no doubt that you'll be a true hero one day.|
40089|#823$#Reading is a wonderful pastime. You learn so much doing it!|
40090|#822$#If things are getting too tough for you to beat, why don't you try fortifying your weapon?|
40091|#824$#You're so weak and thin! You should eat better!|
40092|#824$#Sometimes I feel really bored when I'm with you.|
40093|#824$#If I hadn't agreed to your request, I might have been happier...|
40094|#822$#Don't blame me for not respecting you. It isn't like you've shown me any respect.|
40095|#824$#I'm not interested in talking to you right now.|
40096|#824$#Don't worry about me. I'm the best at running away!|
40097|#824$#Tell me frankly: do you like me?|
40098|#824$#What has become of the adventurous life that we wanted? Why have things been so boring lately?|
40099|#824$#I've always wanted to know: do you consider me a brother?|
40100|#824$#Some of the things that come out of your mouth are really pointless.|
40101|#821$#How about you change your outfit up? I'm so tired of seeing you in the same clothes everyday!|
40102|#822$#Remember to hang out with me! I'll find something fun for us to do.|
40103|#821$#It's so interesting to travel with you. I get to see lots of new things all the time!|
40104|#822$#How nice it would be if my partner were a pretty girl with beautiful long hair!|
40105|#821$#Have you gained weight lately? You should cut down on the sweets.|
40106|#822$#Sigh! Why aren't there any enemies worth my time?|
40107|#821$#Your skills seem to be improving. A simple punch from you is enough to deal with most enemies.|
40108|#822$#When you have any problems, let me know. I can't guarantee that I'll be able to help you, but I'll do my best.|
40109|#821$#I'm rather careless, so I guess I'm lucky to have you with me!|
40110|#822$#Do you know that you snore when you're sleeping? I can't really sleep well with all that noise!|
40111|#823$#Let's check out the dungeon later. I have a feeling that we'll find some rare treasure!|
40112|#822$#Don't get cocky after gaining a Lv.1 Secret Stone. You can still get it upgraded further by merchants in different cities and villages, making it even more powerful!|
40113|#821$#You have to keep improving! If I fall in battle, I need to be able to trust you to protect me as I've protected you!|
40114|#822$#Don't wait for the enemy to attack you! The best defense is a good offense.|
40115|#823$#Wherever you go, I'll definitely follow you 'till the end!|
40116|#822$#Don't you need to upgrade your equipment? It'll be really embarrassing if you fall before I do.|
40117|#821$#You might be scrawny, but you're pretty tough!|
40118|#822$#You look like you haven't been in love before... Would you like some tips?|
40119|#823$#Are there any dungeons with interesting events? If so, take me there!|
40120|#823$#You know, hanging out with you so much has taught me that you're really funny!|
40121|#824$#You don't want me to follow you, do you?|
40122|#824$#Hopefully we can learn to understand each other.|
40123|#824$#You've changed. You're not the same person that I once knew.|
40124|#824$#So this is the limit of your sincerity. I've overestimated you.|
40125|#824$#I'm not in a good mood now... Could you just leave me alone?|
40126|#824$#I'm a bit tired... Can we stop and take a break?|
40127|#824$#Am I not good enough for you to look in the eye?|
40128|#824$#Is my strength useless to you?|
40129|#824$#Your life would be better without me, wouldn't it?|
40130|#824$#My patience has a limit...|
40131|#821$#I'm so lucky to have gotten to adventure with you.|
40132|#822$#Good to see you again! Let's chat!|
40133|#823$#I'm so happy to be with you! We should chat more often.|
40134|#821$#You're pretty good! You'll have to tell me your combat secrets when you have a chance.|
40135|#822$#It's important to me that you're happy. Don't get too hung up on the opinions of others.|
40136|#821$#Don't let all these problems get you down. I'll always be by your side.|
40137|#823$#I'm touched whenever I see you working hard.|
40138|#821$#If you have something to tell me, tell me directly.|
40139|#822$#Did you make some new friends recently? If so, you must introduce me.|
40140|#821$#If there's something that you are too embarrassed to to talk to me about, remember that you have other friends too!|
40141|#821$#Undertaking quests is the best way to obtain XP! Don't forget it!|
40142|#822$#If there's anything you need, you can go to Navea and shop around!|
40143|#823$#Do you need to change your equipment? You should try to hunt down some gear in the local towns and shops. They have some real treasures sometimes!|
40144|#823$#Your safety is the most important thing to me.|
40145|#821$#Whatever your decision, I'll stand by you 'till the end.|
40146|#823$#Even if the whole world turns its back on you, I'll still be here to support you.|
40147|#821$#You can get tokens by completing certain quests. These tokens can be exchanged for some unusual items!|
40148|#822$#Skill Points can be reset, but it takes quite a lot of money to do! So, remember to be careful with your points!|
40149|#823$#If there's anything I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask. I love to help out!|
40150|#822$#Do you feel more confident with me around?|
40151|#824$#You know you've been acting pretty cold towards me lately, right?|
40152|#824$#Out of all the things in all the worlds, I think I hate you most.|
40153|#824$#You seem pretty unhappy with me.|
40154|#824$#I've got nothing else to say to you!|
40155|#824$#I want to scream to vent my frustrations!|
40156|#824$#I thought you had bigger dreams. I never imagined that you'd be content with something like this.|
40157|#824$#Even though you're my partner, you should still be polite!|
40158|#824$#Can you please stop being so childish?|
40159|#824$#I've had enough of your slow attacks! You're going to get us both killed!|
40160|#824$#You're so narrow-minded... Can't you learn from my courageous example?|
40161|#822$#Haha! So you're bored again and want to find someone to chat with?|
40162|#821$#Excellent speed allows you to evade danger, as well as giving you a better chance to attack.|
40163|#822$#You can train with me when you're not busy. I'm sure it'll help you a lot.|
40164|#821$#You'll be more powerful if your attacks were more direct. I'll teach you some techniques later.|
40165|#822$#You need to be alert in dungeons! Wouldn't it be humiliating if you set off a trap by mistake?|
40166|#821$#When I see you being so sensitive, I worry I'm being too bold.|
40167|#822$#The more time I spend with you, the more I see that you are a reliable partner.|
40168|#821$#You're advancing quickly! I knew I was right about you!|
40169|#822$#Don't forget to bring me along to a dungeon! Every extra hand helps!|
40170|#821$#Just let me know if you want to hear my thoughts.|
40171|#821$#Numbers give strength. Try to group up with friends more often.|
40172|#822$#I swear I'll protect you, even if it means sacrificing my life!|
40173|#821$#You're really important to me... Without you, who would I train with?|
40174|#822$#You're really skilled! This must be because of all of the trials you've been through, right?|
40175|#821$#I never realized that you're so cultured. You're such a deep thinker...|
40176|#822$#If we're ambushed in battle, we'll cover each other, back to back.|
40177|#821$#Although I can be a little careless sometimes, but I don't miss important details.|
40178|#822$#If you encounter any problems during your adventures, don't hesitate to let me know!|
40179|#823$#If you meet someone that you get along with, add them all to your friends list!|
40180|#822$#Equipment comes in sets. If you wear a complete set, you'll benefit from some powerful bonuses!|
40181|#824$#I don't feel like you care about me...|
40182|#824$#Could it be that you've already found a new friend and don't want me anymore?|
40183|#824$#If you don't like me, just tell me...|
40184|#824$#Could it be that you've already found a new friend and don't want me anymore?|
40185|#824$#What did I do wrong? Why do you hate me so much?|
40186|#824$#I'm so glad that you still want to talk with me! I was worried I'd upset you...|
40187|#824$#You haven't talked to me in so long. I've been so sad lately...|
40188|#824$# I like you... I just think I'm too much for you.|
40189|#824$#Are you here to console me?|
40190|#824$#I always feel so lonely when I don't see you...|
40191|#823$#Whenever I see you, it makes me really happy!|
40192|#821$#Can't you stop fighting all the time? My heart would break if you got hurt...|
40193|#822$#Can you take me to higher ground? I'd like to see more of the landscape around here.|
40194|#821$#What are we going to do today? I can't wait!|
40195|#823$#You're so good to me! I'm really happy being with you!|
40196|#821$#Do you like me? Can't you at least tell me that?|
40197|#822$#If there's something on your mind, please tell me.|
40198|#822$#I can see it in your eyes... Is something worrying you?|
40199|#822$#As long as you tell me what you need, I'll do my best to help you.|
40200|#821$#If I become the enemy's target, will you protect me?|
40201|#822$#Hehe, do you think of me often?|
40202|#823$#I really admire those who risk their lives to heal others. They are the greatest!|
40203|#823$#You belong to me! I won't let anyone else have you!|
40204|#822$#From now on, you can only summon me. Deal?|
40205|#821$#The weather is foul, so make sure you bundle up! I don't want you catching a cold!|
40206|#823$#I'm really happy to just chat with you. It'll be great if everything could be like this forever...|
40207|#823$#Did you know the heroes of old wrote the secrets of their mastery in books? If you find them, they could make your skills even stronger.|
40208|#822$#I wonder if humans and Eidolons can fall in love with each other.|
40209|#823$#You're so good to me. What can I do for you in return?|
40210|#823$#Your favorite Eidolon is me, right?|
40211|#824$#I need my partner who cares for me!|
40212|#824$#I think spending time with you is really boring sometimes.|
40213|#824$#Do you doubt my skills?|
40214|#824$#You know what? Chatting with you is really difficult...|
40215|#824$#I don't think you mean to, but you're so cold towards me...|
40216|#824$#When you get into trouble, don't ask me to help you...|
40217|#824$#If you don't want to be poor, keep killing monsters and taking their loot!|
40218|#824$#Are you completely broke? Is that why you're dressed so shabbily?|
40219|#824$#I could win these battles without you.|
40220|#824$#You came looking for me because you're conscience was bothering you, right?|
40221|#822$# Maybe if you put a little more effort into things, you'd be somewhat more impressive.|
40222|#821$#I think you can handle these enemies pretty easily.|
40223|#822$#What's up? Is there something you want to discuss?|
40224|#821$#Heh! You're so adorable! I can't help but tease you!|
40225|#822$#Are you spreading foul rumors about me? Is that why everyone's been looking at me so strangely?|
40226|#821$#Come on! Go to more challenging places! How can you enjoy wasting so much time on weaklings?|
40227|#823$#You have to tell me if someone bullies you! I'll make sure they never do it again!|
40228|#824$#Offense is the best defense! Have you still not learned that?|
40229|#822$#You'll just have to act as my servant until your skills surpass mine!|
40230|#822$#You've improved unbelievably fast. You're finally qualified to fight alongside me.|
40231|#821$#When fortifying Lv.28+ weapons to 20, something amazing will happen. Go try it!|
40232|#822$#You should be honored that you can fight beside me!|
40233|#821$#What's the point of joining a Guild? You have to follow orders and pretend to be a decent person... that's definitely not my style!|
40234|#822$#If you can't keep up with me in battle, I may just leave you behind.|
40235|#821$#You're so cute. Never change!|
40236|#822$#Hehe, I didn't expect you to be that useful. I'm kinda impressed.|
40237|#821$#Looks like you need someone to protect you. When will you be able to stand on your own two feet?|
40238|#822$#I must be the most beautiful Eidolon... Do you think so? Hint: the correct answer is, "Yes, of course you are!"'|
40239|#821$#It's only natural for you to be good to me. After all, who else would you be good to?|
40240|#822$#You just go ahead and fight that nasty monster over there. I'll help out if I feel like it.|
40241|Humph! I'm not just acting cute! I'm Red for a reason.|
40242|The leader should be dressed in red!|
40243|Why am I the Black Ranger? Why is anything what it is? It's because I'm a nihilist.|
40244|My deck is full of demons. Like my soul.|
40245|Simon? Hmmm... Never heard of Simon...|
40246|Yeah! Card Rangers forever!|
40247|Is it okay if I just build my own Card Deck according to my own preferences?|
40248|Eh? Am I normal?|
40249|Everyone gets along so well...|
40250|It's so nice when everyone can play together...|
41001|What's your biggest fear?|
41002|What are you afraid of?|
41003|#821$#I don't think that being afraid means you are weak,
#822$#I think it means you understand your limitations.|
41004|#824$#Afraid or not, I know I've gotta go all out and give a fight my best.|
41005|#822$#My strength comes from my friends.
#824$#My greatest fear is that something bad might happen to them.|
41006|#822$#Fear is a natural response to dangerous situations, and it can help keep you safe.
#821$#Just don't let your fears control you!|
41011|What's the secret to getting along with people?|
41012|How should I manage my relationships with other people?|
41013|#822$#It's best to be honest with others,
#821$#just like how you and I are!|
41014|#822$#It's tough when you don't know much about someone...
#821$#Maybe you should ask them about their hobbies!|
41015|#824$#Nothing is perfect, so don't force it if it isn't working out. You can't get along with everyone!|
41016|#821$#Just be yourself! That's all anyone can do.
#823$#If they don't like the real you, then what's the point?|
41021|What's your advice for going up against strong enemies?|
41022|How do you handle a tough opponent?|
41023|#822$#You need to go up against bigger baddies if you want to get stronger!
#823$#But don't get discouraged if you get whooped. Hone your skills and then try again!|
41024|#822$#Even the toughest enemy will have a weakness. Try watching the enemy for a bit to see how they fight.
#821$#You might be able to figure out their weakness before you even engage them.|
41025|#823$#You can beat up any tough guy so long as you have the right partner! Hint, hint...|
41026|#824$#If you're in over your head, get those feet moving and get out of there!
#821$#There's no shame in running from a fight you can't win. Valor isn't all that useful if it gets you killed!|
41031|What do you think it means to be courageous?|
41032|How would you define courage?|
41033|#822$#To be courageous is to persevere in the face of adversity!
#821$#Don't let anyone deter you from your goals! Fight for what you believe in!|
41034|#821$#Courage is smiling even when things are at their worst.|
41035|#823$#Courage is doing your best to protect the ones you love.|
41036|#824$#Real courage is facing the things you fear,
#824$#rather than pretending that you aren't afraid.|
41041|What should someone do when they make a mistake?|
41042|What's the best way to apologize?|
41043|#821$#It's best to fess up when you've made a mistake.
#824$#If you lie to protect yourself, you're undermining the trust those people had in you.|
41044|#824$#If you don't apologize, then things will just get worse.
#821$#If you're sincere, you'll find forgiveness.|
41045|#823$#A person who's willing to apologize is a brave person. Being able to acknowledge your mistakes is a noble trait.|
41046|#822$#It's not always about right or wrong. People can have different yet perfectly valid views on a subject.
#821$#Try to consider things from the other side!|
41051|Do you like all creatures?|
41052|Tell me about your views on life.|
41053|#822$#They say all life comes from the Cube of Gaia.
#822$#So, in that case, all life must be equal. Everything is a unique existence that cannot be replaced.|
41054|#823$#I like to interact with all kinds of creatures! Even without a common language, we can still communicate.|
41055|#821$#All life should be respected. Even those obnoxious bunnyhops...|
41056|#822$#It frustrates me that so few creatures can get along with one another.
#824$#If we could take the time to better understand one another, I think this would be a more peaceful world.|
41061|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
41062|What do you know about the Cube of Gaia?|
41063|#822$#It's said that the Cube of Gaia is buried somewhere,
#821$#and the energy emanating from it is responsible all sorts of miraculous things.|
41064|#821$#The legend says that the Cube of Gaia was used to create the Aura Kingdom, a perfect paradise.
#823$#There's no pain or sorrow there, just endless and eternal joy.|
41065|#822$#The energy from the Cube of Gaia is a vital part of this world.
#821$#The people with the ability to channel that energy are known as the Envoys of Gaia.|
41066|#824$#There are so many mysteries about how our many worlds came to be... There's so much that we still don't understand.|
41071|I want to know more about Masteries.|
41072|What can you tell me about Mastery?|
41073|#823$#Masteries provide useful boosts to your combat skills!|
41074|#821$#As you continue to increase in level, you'll automatically gain new Masteries!|
41075|#822$#Keep an eye out for Tokens! You'll get them for completing certain quests.
#821$#Once you have a bunch, talk to your Class Master in Navea. They'll teach you advanced Masteries in exchange for Tokens.|
41076|#823$#You're really something! They say only the greatest heroes can achieve Mastery.|
41081|Tell me about equipment.|
41082|I want to learn more about weapons and armor.|
41083|#823$#The staff is a powerful weapon, allowing you to manipulate the raw elemental forces of the world.|
41084|#822$#Be on the lookout for treasure chests dropped by enemies. You might find something rare and powerful!|
41085|#821$#Your weapons will wear down after a while. Don't forget to bring it in for repairs!|
41086|#821$#The Great Axe a great way to deal out a ton of damage in a short amount of time!|
41091|How do I send messages to people?|
41092|Can you tell me about mail and private chat?|
41093|#823$#You can easily send items and money to your buddies through the mail system.|
41094|#822$#If a message is rejected, it'll be saved for ten days. If you don't reclaim it by then, you'll lose any items or money attached to it!|
41095|#821$#You can switch to Private Chat by clicking the "R" button on the lower left hand corner of the Message Interface!|
41096|#821$#Remember to be polite! Nobody likes a jerk.|
41101|What is that combat style you use?|
41102|What's so special about your battle technique?|
41103|#822$#I invented this style myself! It's so fresh I haven't even named it yet!
#821$#Why don't you help me think of a name?|
41104|#822$#I combined martial arts and Lightning to create a rather... shocking set of techniques.
#823$#I can even paralyze giant monsters with it!|
41105|#821$#As a spirit, I'm not constrained by gravity. I can attack from any angle!|
41106|#823$#Hah! I knew you'd notice! My Electrical Storm attack is pretty awesome, isn't it?|
41111|Did you design your outfit yourself?|
41112|Tell me about your outfit.|
41113|#821$#Don't I look stylish?
#823$#The ingenious color coordination and stunning design has earned top marks from everyone who's seen it!|
41114|#821$#Hah! Some people have said that this outfit makes me look like an elegant (and dashing) transfer student from abroad!|
41115|#822$#This custom design is both form-fitting and aerodynamic, allowing me to kick butt in style!|
41116|#824$#What, do you think it looks bad?
#821$#Be honest! I'm really good at handling constructive criticism. (Meanie...)|
41121|What allows you to float like that?|
41122|Can I fly like you do?|
41123|#822$#It's very important to watch your weight; you definitely won't be able to fly if you're too heavy!
#821$#That's why I'm very careful about what I eat and drink. Why don't you give that a try?|
41124|#821$#I remember being told that these gizmos on my arms help me float.
#822$#If there were any more of them in existence, you could give them a try!|
41125|#821$#You need to be streamlined and aerodynamic.
#822$#Like¡K like...
#823$#Just like my hair! It was styled in a wind tunnel!|
41126|#824$#Gravity is all mental. Just focus hard enough and you'll be able to break free of it!|
41131|Are you friends with Merrilee?|
41132|What do you think about Merrilee?|
41133|#822$#W-Who told you about Merrilee? I deny everything!|
41134|#822$#Merrilee is...uh...it's hard to tell her how I feel.|
41135|#823$#Sigh... Merrilee is so dreamy... I'm smitten...|
41136|#822$#Man, what I wouldn't give to go out on a date with Merrilee!|
41141|What can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
41142|Have you heard any rumors about other Eidolons?|
41143|#824$#I haven't had the chance to chat with other Eidolons lately... Be sure to bring me along if you meet any of them!|
41144|#821$#Alessa's Horn Skewer ability deals all sorts of Holy damage!
#822$#I can't imagine what it'd be like to have such a powerful weapon growing out of my head.|
41145|#821$#Why, what have you heard? Did Merrilee say anything about me?
#822$#What? No, it's nothing. Really. I was just curious, that's all!|
41146|#821$#I like chatting with Grimm a lot! He's really optimistic and always finds nice things to say!
#823$#He's perfect to talk to when I'm not feeling so confident.|
41151|How does it feel to manipulate electricity like you do?|
41152|How does it feel to generate lightning?|
41153|#823$#Electricity is no different to me than air or blood. My entire body is like a battery!
#823$#As a bonus, I can move just as quick as lightning can! Zoom!|
41154|#822$#Because electricity is second nature to me, I sometimes forget just how strong it can be.
#821$#Sometimes I get surprised by how powerful my attacks are! ...But I'm not bragging.|
41155|#821$#Generating lightning feels a heckuva lot better than getting struck by it!|
41156|#824$#Sometimes it's a bit tingly, like when your foot falls asleep.|
41161|What are those rings around your arms?|
41162|Can you tell me about those rings you wear on your arms?|
41163|#822$#These bad boys don't just look good - they're where my strength comes from!
#821$#They let me pull electricity out of the air, store it up, and then release it in attacks. Neat, huh?|
41164|#821$#I don't know if they have a name, I've always just called them my Power Rings.
#822$#They give me the ability to fly, and they also let me store up electrical energy.|
41165|#823$#An excellent question! These two power rings are the source of my power!|
41166|#824$#I've just always had them. No one has been able to tell me who made them or even where they came from.|
41171|Why do you keep looking at the forest?|
41172|How do you feel about the forest?|
41173|#821$#Forests make me happy! I love the soft breezes that drift through the trees.
#823$#Ah... it feels so good...|
41174|#821$#I feel at peace when I watch a tree swaying in the wind.
#823$#It makes me long to sit under those trees with a loved one, talking and laughing the day away.|
41175|#822$#I try and talk to the woodland creatures whenever I can.
#821$#They always have the most unusual gossip!|
41176|#824$#Flying through the forest relaxes me! I can drift for hours without a care in the world.|
41181|How is it that you are always so full of life?|
41182|Why are you always so energetic?|
41183|#821$#I get my energy from my optimism!
#823$#What's the point of getting tired when so many wonderful things are just waiting to be found?|
41184|#822$#Adventuring with you always fills me with energy.
#821$#Our bond of friendship is the source of my power!|
41185|#822$#Ha! I adore the fact that every day brings new discoveries and experiences!
#821$#With this much curiosity, it's difficult to ever be tired! Or bored!|
41186|#824$#I get tired just like anyone else. I'll rest for 10 minutes or so a day. It seems like such a waste, though...|
41191|What would you do if we separated?|
41192|This adventure can't go on forever. What do you do afterwards?|
41193|#822$#Split up? You can be such a downer sometimes! Yeesh...
#821$#I suppose if we had to part ways, I'd always hold onto the memory of our time together.|
41194|#822$#If you were gone, I'd try and find Merr... Uh... No, nevermind. Forget I said anything.|
41195|#821$#I'd be sad, but I wouldn't let that keep me down! I'd still travel the world and try and help those in need.|
41196|#824$#It's not like we'd never see one another again, right? Our friendship goes too deep to just disappear like that.|
41301|What type of boys do you like?|
41302|Who would be your ideal boyfriend?|
41303|#823$Oooh! You're gonna make me blush! #822$How can a lady like me answer such a bold question, hehe!|
41304|#821$Hmmm, I...I think a dashing, tall gentleman would be right for me. #823$I hope that's not too cliche!|
41305|#822$Hmm...My ideal boyfriend would be kind, gentle, thoughtful...and love snakes, just like me, hehe! #823$I hope that's not asking for too much...|
41306|#822$Someone who's even half as kind and generous as you would be perfect!|
41311|What should I do if I come across an incredibly powerful foe?|
41312|If I ever come up against an eneny stronger than I am, what's the best thing to do?|
41313|#821$#As long as we're teamed up together, I bet we can take on even the toughest of opponents! #822$#When I call upon the Power of Love, your HP will regenerate. It's a foolproof plan, no doubt about it!|
41314|#821$#With my icy attacks I'll distract the enemy long enough for you to come up with a cunning plan! #822$#Once you've established your strategy, we'll take 'em down together, I know it!|
41315|#823$#Don't worry at all! Hehe! If we team up to use our ultimate combo, we're nearly unstoppable! We can do anything together!|
41316|#822$#You keep a stock of HP potions on hand, don't you? You should keep some just in case there is an emergency. I want you to be safe!|
41321|Is there anything I should know about your weapon?|
41322|Does your staff have any secret power?|
41323|#821$#My staff is critical to my abilities, I never leave home without it. #822$#You'll never see me separated from my staff - it's almost like it's part of me!|
41324|#822$#My staff was created by the power of love that gathers in the Aura Kingdom. #821$#The more I use it, the more powerful it becomes! I hope to use it to spread love across all worlds.|
41325|#821$#Being straight from the Aura Kingdom, my staff greatly increases my magical capabilities. #822$#It's especially attuned to my ice magic, making me even more powerful!|
41326|#822$#Do you see the head of the staff? It looks just like a snake, hehe! I love snakes, so it's totally a great fit, don't you think?|
41331|What kind of food do you like most?|
41332|What's your favorite food?|
41333|#822$#Hmm, that's a tough one...I really do love sweet, red apples! #823$#I feel really healthy and rejuvenated when I bite into a crisp apple.|
41334|#822$#Most of all, I loooove fruits! Apples are my favorite!|
41335|#821$#My favorite is definitely apples - big, juicy, red apples! They're so sweet, I can't stop eating!#822$#Would you like one too? I'll happily share!|
41336|#823$#Can you guess? It's a fruit that's as beautiful as a ruby and has the perfect crisp, sweet taste! Why, of course, it's an apple!|
41341|Is there anything in particular that you just can't stand?|
41342|Is there anything you don't like?|
41343|#824$#One of the things I can't stand is a bad hair day! #824$#If I see a split end...I get so mad for the rest of the day! I have to get a trim as soon as possible!|
41344|#822$#I really don't like people who don't take the time to wash their hair... #824$#It's so gross! How can they stand that feeling?|
41345|#824$#Strong gusts of wind can be pretty bad. #824$#When it messes up my painstakingly styled hair, I could just scream!|
41346|#824$#Rainy days are the worst - I feel so grumpy when my hair gets soaked!|
41351|What type of animals do you like?|
41352|What's your favorite animal?|
41353|#821$#Maybe it's weird but...I really like snakes! #823$#With their cute little eyes and flicking tongues... I just love them!|
41354|#822$#I actually really like snakes! I think they're very graceful creatures...|
41355|#821$#In my opinion, snakes are some of the most beautiful creatures. #824$#I don't understand why people say they're evil - I've learned to appreciate all things in nature!|
41356|#821$#Slithering swiftly and flicking their tongues... I'd love to taste the air like a snake does! #823$#Hehe, I bet it would be fun to be a snake for a day!|
41361|What do you think of Terra?|
41362|Do you know any interesting things about Terra?|
41363|#822$#Avians have a thing for the mystery that dark gods tend to present. #822$#As a result, the other tribes tend not to trust the Avians.|
41364|#821$#Dwarvish craftsmen are the best machinists in the world! #823$#I've heard their work can rival even that of the greatest artists.|
41365|#822$#There are so many different races in Terra! The Dwarves, the Makar, the Gnomes... #821$#They're all quite different, with their own beliefs and their own customs. Isn't the world amazing?|
41366|#822$#I've heard that, sometimes, an angel or demon loses its way and arrives in Terra...|
41371|Tell me the legend of the Cube of Gaia.|
41372|I want to learn about the Cube of Gaia.|
41373|#822$#As the legend goes, the Cube of Gaia once held open the pathways between the three worlds. #822$#That's part of why there are so many different cultures and beliefs.|
41374|#821$#All living things, good and evil alike, are connected to the Cube of Gaia.|
41375|#822$#Eidolons have a particularly strong link to the Cube of Gaia, allowing them to create new items. #823$#Given how powerful the Cube of Gaia is, it is no surprise these items are often powerful and rare!|
41376|#821$#It's said that the Cube of Gaia is not just an energy source... It truly is an item of mystery that not even us Eidolons are sure about...|
41381|What's a HP Potion used for?|
41382|Please tell me about HP Potions.|
41383|#821$#HP Potions can restore your HP! They're a necessity for any serious adventurer. Mhm!|
41384|#822$#Merchants in the various towns and cities sell HP Potions, but you'll obviously need money if you want them. Let's make money together!|
41385|#821$#HP Potions need time to work to their fullest, so it's important to use them at the right moment! Don't wait until it's too late!|
41386|#823$#There are level restrictions to HP Potions, so don't waste money buying HP Potions that don't match your level!|
41391|Do you know what Experience Crystals are used for?|
41392|Please tell me about Experience Crystals.|
41393|#821$#You can obtain Experience Crystals by defeating monsters! They're a great source of strength for Eidolons like me.|
41394|#822$#Be sure not to misplace all the Experience Crystals you find, ok? If you give them to your Eidolons, they'll gain some XP!|
41395|#821$#High quality Experience Crystals give Eidolons even greater XP. I hope you can find some for me!|
41396|#822$#An Experience Crystal can be given to an Eidolon to increase that Eidolon's XP.|
41401|Why do you manipulate ice?|
41402|Why specialize in Ice Magic?|
41403|#824$#I'm not really sure why I'm most skilled with ice magic... #822$#But, whatever works! It helps that my staff is perfect for boosting that type of power.|
41404|#822$#I was able to manipulate ice and cold soon after I was born. #821$#I guess... Maybe, this is fate? Hehe!|
41405|#823$#Well... I've tried to use other kinds, but my staff really only enhances Ice Magic, so I decided to stick with it!|
41406|#821$#An icy, adorable appearance and the freshness of youth... #823$#Isn't that an irresistible combination for Humans? Hehe!|
41411|How do you care for your hair?|

41413|#821$#The hair grows on the scalp, therefore you must start from the scalp if you want to have beautiful hair. #822$#As long as you massage your scalp daily, your hair will be beautiful!|
41414|#821$#The secret to hair care is, of course, regular brushing. #823$#Brushing the hair not only keeps it clean and neat, but it also strengthens the hair!|
41415|#823$#Keeping my hair moisturized is easy! Hehe! Not all my magic is battle oriented, you know.|

41421|I want to know how it feels to fly.|
41422|What is it like to fly?|
41423|#821$#Flying is like being in love... #823$#It feels wild and free, yet wholly terrifying and... Oh gosh, I'm blushing!|
41424|#821$#The feeling of flight is like young love... #823$#Even when things are the same, they feel fresh and new!|
41425|#821$#The best moment is when you reach the peak of your flight and can see the world spread out below you. It is like you've abandoned all your problems on that tiny world beneath you...|
41426|#822$#Flying feels amazing, I wish I could fly together with you! It'd be so much fun!|
41431|Do you have a favorite hairstyle?|
41432|Why'd you choose this hairstyle?|
41433|#821$#I heard there's a really good singer with this hairstyle. #823$#Maybe you'd like to hear me sing? I'm good, I promise!|
41434|#823$#Twintails are playful and cute! I think they suit an innocent maiden like me best, tee hee!|
41435|#824$#Hmm? Are you asking because you don't like my hairstyle? Be honest!|
41436|#822$#Oh my gosh! You don't like twintails, do you? Oooh! I knew it!|
41441|Do you know any secrets about the other Eidolons?|
41442|Got any juicy Eidolon gossip?|
41443|#824$#I think Serif has a fever. #822$#How do I know? Well, every time we talk, his face is always so red, and he's sweating...|
41444|#821$#Serif's nickname is "The Eternal Youth." Don't you think that name really suits him? It's pretty cute!|
41445|#824$#Grimm might be a great conversationalist, but he's also got quite a temper. I'm a little scared of him... #822$#Don't tell him that I said that, eek!|
41446|#822$#The Regal Unicorn has an irresistible charm... #823$#I kind of want to ride Alessa and see what it's like... Do you think she'd let me?|
41451|What kind of Eidolon is Serif?|
41452|What do you think of Serif?|
41453|#822$#Serif? I thought he'd be really witty and funny, but he's always stammering every time we speak...#824$#Do you think I bother him?|
41454|#821$#Serif is really very sweet. I think he's a great friend!|
41455|#821$#I've seen Serif fight - he looks like a skilled warrior!|
41456|#822$#Serif is one of my most reliable friends! #823$#I hope our friendship will last forever and ever and ever!|
41461|What do you think of love?|
41462|Do you have any insight on love?|
41463|#822$#To love another may seem easy in theory, but it's hard in practice...|
41464|#823$#I believe true love is hard to find, so the happiest moment in your life will be meeting that special someone. #823$#If you've already met them, you should cherish them and the time you spend together.|
41465|#821$#Love is a medicine that nourishes one's heart, and an essential element of life. #822$#You shouldn't waste your time, have you found your one, true love?|
41466|#822$#Looking for love can help a person grow, but it can also break a person's heart. #821$#Still, no matter what your opinion of love, you must hold on to hope! Stay positive!|
41471|Why do you carve ice roses?|
41472|Why do you like roses so much?|
41473|#823$#Well... because roses have a special meaning, you know?|
41474|#821$#Roses signify love, blue is the color of miracles... #823$#Love is filled with miracles! Isn't that a romantic message? Hehe!|
41475|#822$#An ice rose says that no matter how icy cold someone's heart is, a passionate love can melt it! #823$#Isn't a flower with that message beautiful?|
41476|#822$#A rose can be used to say so many things without uttering a single word! #821$#What other flower has such an awesome power?|
41481|What secrets do your armbands hold?|
41482|Can you tell me about your armbands?|
41483|#821$#The Freezing Armbands change their rotation based on my mood, which, in turn, gives me power. #822$#When they're spinning at top speed, I can even create a blizzard!|
41484|#823$#The Freezing Armbands help making controlling ice easier. Thanks to it, my Ice Magic is the most powerful!|
41485|#821$#The Freezing Armbands grow as my power does! #822$#Would you believe they were no bigger than a string when I first got them? #823$#Pretty impressive, huh?  Hehe!|
41486|#822$# I don't really know for sure where they came from, haha! I guess it must have come from the Cube of Gaia?|
41491|If we parted ways, what would you do next?|
41492|What would you do if we went our separate ways?|
41493|#824$#Ohh, can we not talk about such sad things...?|
41494|#824$#If we part, my magic and my willpower might vanish... I hope it never happens!|
41495|#824$#You don't...hate me, do you? Why would you ask something like that!?|
41496|#824$#We've gotta stick together! I can't imagine my life without you! Please, let's be friends always!|
41601|What's your favorite season?|
41602|Do you prefer any particular season?|
41603|#822$#Not that fond of winter, I gotta say. #822$#Cold weather makes me want to just eat cookies and hibernate.|
41604|#822$#Huh? Why are you asking me this so suddenly? #822$#Is this a pop quiz?|
41605|#821$#Summer's my favorite season. #823$#The heat really gets me fired up, y'know?|
41606|#823$#Summer makes me feel all energetic, like my flame can burn even hotter!|
41611|What kinds of things do you dream about?|
41612|Let's talk about dreams.|
41613|#824$#Wellll, I did have this super bad nightmare the other night. #824$#I dreamed that instead of fire, I could only breathe soft, gentle clouds. Yuck!|
41614|#822$#Did you know that not just humans dream? All the sentient races dream. Even spirits can dream.|
41615|#821$#When I was still in my egg, I dreamed of this big fireball. #822$#It had giant burning eyes and blew stuff up all the time! #823$#It must've been my very first inspiration!|
41616|#821$#Dreams? Our adventures together are more action-packed than anything I've dreamed about.|
41621|What do you think 'adventure' really is?|
41622|What does 'adventure' mean to you?|
41623|#824$#I'm too tired to talk about adventuring...maybe we fought a couple bad guys too many today.|
41624|#822$#Adventure is about pushing yourself, but not overdoing it. #821$#If you push yourself too hard, you'll be too exhausted to go on more adventures.|
41625|#822$#Fighting with your friends, sharing the great times and the not-so-hot times...#821$#Yeaaaah, that's totally the spirit of adventure, right?|
41626|#823$#Any time I'm with you is a real adventure.|
41631|What are the benefits of traveling?|
41632|What can we learn when we travel?|
41633|#824$#Is it bad that I had to really think about the good points of traveling with you?|
41634|#822$#New lands to explore, new folks to meet, new combustible things to burn...#821$#That's what I like best about traveling!|
41635|#822$#It's all about changing your pace! #821$#If you don't like where you're at, you can just hit the road and leave it all behind to find somewhere new!|
41636|#823$#When we travel, we grow. Every day we travel, we're wiser than the day before, right?|
41641|Do you like animals?|
41642|What do you think of animals?|
41643|#824$#Before we talk about caring for animals, how about taking care of me?|
41644|#824$#Animals kind of annoy me. Because of them, too many people think of me as a pet. #824$#C'mon, the all-time greatest Eidolon isn't gonna fetch a stick, people!|
41645|#822$#Animals and humans share the world. #822$#Humans shouldn't take advantage of animals so much in ways that benefit only them.|
41646|#821$#Best animal of all time? Dragons, obviously. #823$#One day, when you look up 'awesome dragons', my picture will be right there.|
41651|Heard any good gossip lately?|
41652|Have the spirits said anything about what's happening elsewhere?|
41653|#822$#Do you know what Port Skandia's garrison is up to? #821$#They sure put in a lot of effort for such a small village.|
41654|#824$#Recently, I heard that something happened that really dropped the Templars' morale to an all-time low.|
41655|#822$#The Mirabelle Group is an organization that hires people to solve clients' problems. #821$#If you have the time and skill, you can make good money helping folks in need.|
41656|#822$#There are rare monsters all over the world! #822$#If you defeat them and bring proof, the regional guards will give you a nice reward.|
41661|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
41662|What do you know about the Cube of Gaia?|
41663|#822$#I feel like part of my existence is tied to you, but the other part's tied to the Cube. #821$#You and I both have the power of Gaia, but it's something else, too...|
41664|#822$#The spirits say that the Cube of Gaia helped make a buncha worlds. #821$#Each one has its own rules and laws and stuff.|
41665|#822$#The Cube of Gaia is what inspired people to discover all the magic and technology the world has today. Neat, huh?|
41666|#824$#All spirits who become Eidolons know of the Cube of Gaia, but none of us know why it's here.|
41671|Let's talk about Quests.|
41672|Could you tell me more about Quests?|
41673|#823$#Look for exclamation marks on your map - that means someone wants to make a request of you.|
41674|#823$#Helping people in need always feels good deep down inside. That or I have some bad gas today.|
41675|#823$#Click on the little image beside the map to take on quests you haven't taken yet!|
41676|#823$#Once you're level 25,  you can take on quests posted on Mirabelle's Bulletin Boards all over the world!|
41681|What are Secret Stones used for?|
41682|Tell me more about Secret Stones.|
41683|#823$#You can use the Energy Secret Stones that monsters drop to fortify other types of Secret Stones!|
41684|#822$#As your own level goes up, so will the maximum fortification level of your Secret Stones.|
41685|#823$#You can sometimes get Rare Secret Stones from killing bosses, so let's be sure to kill a lot of them, okay?|
41686|#821$#The Secret Stones you can buy from Secret Stone Merchants all over the world sometimes have strange magic properties. That's super cool!|
41691|What's the point of the Eidolon Area?|
41692|Tell me about the Eidolon Area.|
41693|#822$#You just might become cool enough that other Eidolons think you're worth lending their power tot. #821$#If you wanna learn more about them, that's where you'll wanna look!|
41694|#822$#Once an Eidolon's level is high enough - and if you've got the right items - they can evolve! #823$#Once an Eidolon evolves, they'll become even more powerful!|
41695|#823$#When you're not fightin', you can change who you've got with you in the Eidolon Area.|
41696|#822$#You can gift XP Crystals to Eidolons by feeding them, #821$#and you can also give Elemental Symbols to improve an Eidolons' skills!|
41701|Do you like the sun and the moon?|
41702|Do you like our world's cycle of day and night?|
41703|#822$#When I'm in a huff, looking at the sun or moon makes me feel better. #821$#Dunno why - maybe their gravity just pulls my problems away.|
41704|#823$#Well, any day's a pretty good day if we can relax and enjoy the sunset, right?|
41705|#821$#Sometimes, I feel like maybe if I focus real hard, I can control the sun and the moon. #823$#Maybe one day it'll come true!|
41706|#821$#This world depends on the balance of day and night. If you didn't have that, things would get outta whack pretty quick.|
41711|What's it like to be a fire expert?|
41712|How does it feel to play with fire?|
41713|#822$#Sometimes breathing fire is an problem, y'know? #824$#I've burned up more things by sneezing than I can count.|
41714|#822$#When it comes to handling fire, I'm the tops! #823$#Or, y'know, top three at the worst.|
41715|#823$#It's like every battle is a barbecue!|
41716|#821$#Imagine if you could suck all your anger into your lungs, then blow it at bad people. It's kind of like that!|
41721|Do you have a bad temper?|
41722|Do you ever get really mad?|
41723|#822$#H-hey, what's with that question? #821$#We've been together long enough that I'm sure you already know.|
41724|#824$#Well, you know how sometimes I go wild during a fight and beat foes into the ground...|
41725|#824$#So I get frustrated sometimes. So what? I keep it under control. Mostly. #822$#...Are you still mad about the burns?|
41726|#821$#When I get really angry, I just want to incinerate someone! #823$#It's like hitting them with rage that makes them go away forever!|
41731|You're kind of sensitive about your size, right?|
41732|Will you ever get any bigger?|
41733|#821$#Even you're calling me small now? My #1 partner who's supposed to have my back? Say it ain't so!|
41734|#822$#I totally endorse that ancient saying: "Size doesn't matter."|
41735|#822$#I'll be as big as a tree someday - no - even bigger than a tree! #821$#Then, no one will call me small, ever!|
41736|#821$#Once I grow up, my fire will burn so hot I'll be able to melt rocks or magic rings! #823$#Everyone will want me as their Eidolon then.|
41741|Tell me about the other Eidolons.|
41742|Heard any rumors about the other Eidolons?|
41743|#823$#Next time I see them, I'll chat and dig up some dirt for you.|
41744|#822$#Merrilee tries to look all dainty, but she can be a real thug! #821$#She keeps healing people so they can beat up their opponents forever!|
41745|#822$#Alessa never misses a chance to boast about how fast she can gallop. #823$#She IS fast, yeah, but she doesn't have a pair of wings!|
41746|#821$#Keep it under your hat, but Serif has had a huge crush on Merrilee for aaaaages! #822$#Merrilee's so oblivious to his feelings, though.|
41751|What sort of power do you have hidden within you?|
41752|When will your powers fully awaken?|
41753|#822$#I sure wish I knew... #824$#I look forward to when I become a full-fledged dragon.|
41754|#821$#It sounds weird to say, but I feel like as long as we stick together, I have unlimited potential. #822$#I just hope I can control unlimited potential!|
41755|#822$#I can feel my power getting stronger as we fight. #823$#I hope it's a sign that I'll fully awaken soon.|
41756|#823$#When I fully awaken, you'll have the power of a super dragon on your side. Who's gonna win against us?|
41761|Let's talk about Dragons.|
41762|What do you think of Dragons?|
41763|#823$#There are tons of different kinds of spirits and creatures out there, but dragons are totally the best.|
41764|#821$#I'm glad I was born a dragon. Anything else would've been like a silver medal.|
41765|#821$#There's an old legend that says if you climb to the top of a certain waterfall, you can become a dragon. #822$#I think it's just a metaphor for overcoming challenges, but it'd be rad if it was real, huh?|
41766|#824$#There's always someone who thinks that dragons are just big, flying lizards. What are they smoking? #822$ If I meet those people, I'll set 'em straight - with a little flame, maybe.|
41771|What do you think is the most incredible thing in the world?|
41772|What's your most marvelous experience you've had?|
41773|#822$#Uh...just between you and me, I'm amazed every time I realize I can blow fire through my nostrils!|
41774|#822$#Whenever I can feel the power within me growing, it's really strange, but in a good way. #821$#It's hard to explain with words.|
41775|#822$#Meeting you, of course! #821$#Don't you think our destined meeting was totally magical and stuff?|
41776|#822$#I'm always amazed by the way people keep searching for happiness. #824$#They go through so many hardships, but hope keeps them going each day.|
41781|Have you ever actually walked on your legs?|
41782|Can you walk? I've never seen you do it.|
41783|#822$#Now that you mention it, I don't think I've ever tried.|
41784|#821$#If you could fly all the time, would YOU bother walking?|
41785|#824$#Whoever told you that I scoot across the floor like a lame duck, that's 100% false. How uncool!|
41786|#822$#I guess if I had to walk, I probably could. Maybe we'll find out one day.|
41791|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
41792|What plans do you have after we part ways?|
41793|#822$#You 'n me, we're friends to the end. We'll never be apart, right?|
41794|#822$#I guess I'd continue traveling to new places. #821$#My biggest dream is to explore everything in the world!|
41795|#824$#Isn't it a bit too early to think about things like this? #822$#There are really important questions we should focus on, like whether pancakes or waffles are the superior breakfast.|
41796|#822$#It'd make me sad, but who can say what destiny has in store for us? #824$#I'd remember our time together fondly and face the future without dragon my feet!|
41901|What do you like to do for fun?|
41902|How do you usually kill time?|
41903|#822$#I adore exercising! It's so good for your health, don't you agree?|
41904|#822$#I just love moving as fast as I can!
#821$#As long as you push yourself, it is so easy to forget all your worries!|
41905|#821$#Hehe! That's a good question!
#823$#My answer is, of course, exercise!|
41906|#822$#I just love to fly!
#823$#You should come with me next time!|
41911|What is your favorite food?|
41912|What do you normally eat?|
41913|#824$#Not carrots. I'm normally not that picky, but please don't confuse me with a normal pony!|
41914|#822$#Hmm... what do I like to eat...
#821$#A nice, crisp salad is always pretty tasty.|
41915|#821$#Grass shoots with morning dew are my absolute favorite! 
#823$#They taste even better after a good run!|
41916|#822$#One can never have too much fiber and vitamins in their diet.
#821$#As such, I love fresh picked vegetables and fruits!|
41921|What do you dislike?|
41922|What kind of things do you hate?|
41923|#822$#Hypocritical people are just annoying. Why can't they stop?|
41924|#822$#I really hate liars. 
#824$#How wonderful this world would be if we all stopped lying.|
41925|#821$#Sin in the name of virtue is like poisoned sugar - it's sweet, but still fatal. 
#823$#False righteousness is absolutely unforgivable!|
41926|#822$#The most annoying thing is when I'm outside and it starts to rain all of a sudden... 
#824$#My mane becomes such a mess, and it takes forever to fix. Ugh.|
41931|What do you think friends are for?|
41932|What do you think of friendship?|
41933|#822$#Friendship is like a flower with light fragrance - a pleasant, long-lasting scent.|
41934|#821$#Friends should care for each other. You already knew this though, right?|
41935|#821$# Friendship is a wonderful, but elusive, thing. It's rare, and, if you miss it, it may never come back to you. 
#823$#So, make sure you cherish your friendships!|
41936|#823$#Lovers and family can also make good friends. 
#821$#Such a connection can never be imitated.|
41941|What do you think justice is?|
41942|What is justice to you?|
41943|#821$#Justice is praising the good and punishing the evil.|
41944|#822$#Justice means no favoritism and no impropriety.|
41945|#823$#Justice is like my Horn of Judgement. It will not forgive sin!|
41946|#823$#People like you, with a full sense of right and wrong, are already the best embodiment of justice!|
41951|Let's talk about the other races.|
41952|What do you know about some of the other races?|
41953|#821$#This world is very large, with so many different kinds of life! 
#822$#Don't assume that every other race is just like Humans!|
41954|#822$#The Makar are very proud, and look down on everybody else. 
#824$#I'm not very good at getting along with them.|
41955|#822$#The Dwarves have developed some amazing technology! 
#823$#No other race can match them!|
41956|#823$#Gnomes may not look very impressive, but they'll ruin you if you underestimate them.|
41961|Where do you like to vacation?|
41962|Tell me of some good tourist spots.|
41963|#822$#Many fierce monsters live north of Midgard. 
#824$#Oh, wait, you asked about GOOD sightseeing locations....|
41964|#822$#Is the Silverash Shore at the Helonia Coast really made of silvery ash? I'd really like to see it!|
41965|#821$#I would love to take a stroll through the forest near Port Skandia.|
41966|#821$#Shopping in Navea certainly satisfies even the pickiest consumer! 
#823$#With such a large business district - and an auction house! - you can definitely buy quality goods.|
41971|I would like to know about skills.|
41972|Please tell me about skills.|
41973|#822$#As you gain levels, you'll gradually learn new skills!|
41974|#821$#The Bard's healing skills are really helpful, especially for adventures!|
41975|#823$#You can learn new Masteries when you conclude contracts with Eidolons.|
41976|#824$#Some monsters may have weak attacks, but they can still surprise you!|
41981|What good is a backpack?|
41982|Please tell me what to use my backpack for.|
41983|#821$#You can disassemble useless equipment into Fragments.|
41984|#822$#Every competent adventurer should have a durable backpack to carry their loot in.|
41985|#823$#If you run out of room in your backpack, you can always buy a bigger one from the Item Mall.|
41986|#823$#You can use the Automatic Stacking function of your backpack to quickly organize it.|
41991|Let's talk about equipment.|
41992|What do you know about weapons and armor?|
41993|#821$# The Sword and Shield works for both offense and defense. They are very reliable during an encounter.|
41994|#823$# The equipment you buy from the store has a chance to include an enchantment!|
41995|#822$# Those who use Dual Pistols can shoot in two different directions at once. I think that's amazing!|
41996|#823$# As long as the same equipment is fortified, its strength will improve.|
42001|How do you keep your hair so soft and silky?|
42002|Can you give me some tips on how to keep my hair looking great?|
42003|#822$# Hmm, my hair is quite shiny! I'm so glad you noticed!
#821$# I feel proud for having such beautiful hair. It makes me happy every time I feel the breeze roll through it.|
42004|#821$# The key to great hair is diligence!
#823$# I spend a lot of time on it each and every day. That's why it looks as good as it does.|
42005|#821$# Ah, you are not the first one to notice my gorgeous hair.
#823$# The last person to praise my locks wanted to open a salon in my name!|
42006|#823$# Let me give you some advice: wash your hair every morning and let it air dry. You'll definitely see results!|
42011|What is the purpose of your horn?|
42012|What are some of your horn's abilities?|
42013|#822$#Despite what my family may say, my horn is not used to dry clothes!
#824$#So, next time you're doing laundry while I'm around, don't even think about it!|
42014|#821$#Its main function is to pass fair justice to all under trial.|
42015|#822$#Sometimes, when I walk in the dark,
#823$#my horn will shine, making it easy to move in the proper direction!|
42016|#821$#Sometimes my horn will glow on its own, out of my control.
#823$#For as long as I can remember, I've wondered if my horn is its own entity.|
42021|I wonder what it feels like to fly.|
42022|What is it like to soar through the clouds so freely?|
42023|#822$#It's a shame that you can't fly. It looks easy, but it's actually quite difficult to master!|
42024|#821$#Once you get down the basic mechanics, flying is a breeze! It's...hard to explain, though.|
42025|#822$#The only thing that makes me happier than flying is running. I love the exhilaration of a good gallop.
#823$#Oh wait, I guess I fly and run at the same time...|
42026|#821$#People ask me all the time how I can fly without wings.
#823$#I don't understand why they would even ask that. I mean, isn't it obvious?|
42031|Let's talk about your thoughts on responsibility.|
42032|What is your drive in life?|
42033|#822$#Responsibility? I'm not sure if I'm in the mood for such a serious discussion.|
42034|#821$#Well, have you ever pondered about your place in this world?
#822$#Perhaps now is a good time to give it some thought!|
42035|#821$#Everyone has responsibilities and obligations; that's a fact of life.
#823$#No matter what your purpose in life is, the most important thing to do is to make the most out of each and every day.|
42036|#821$#To me, properly representing divine glory in the justice I carry out makes each day meaningful.
#823$#That is my purpose in this world.|
42041|Let's chat about your fondness for running.|
42042|What's it like to run so freely?|
42043|#824$#Running is not just a physical exercise, but an emotional one as well.
#821$#When I want to get away from it all, I just take off, letting my physical pace match the rhythm of my heart!|
42044|#822$#If galloping leaves you exhausted, then you have not realized its full healing potential.|
42045|#823$#Galloping with all you have is so invigorating! I feel fortunate that I'm able to enjoy it so much.|
42046|#821$#When you keep at your fastest pace, everything around you is a blur, freeing your mind from distractions.
#823$#You focus on your racing heart, your pounding soul, your thoughts clearer than they've ever been!|
42051|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42052|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42053|#822$#Oh, so you're in the mood for some gossip? Let me share a few stories with you...|
42054|#822$#It's always nice talking with Grimm. He speaks with such vitality! 
#824$#It's too bad that he can get childish at times. Every once in a while it's funny, but usually it's just annoying.|
42055|#821$#Serif is a very reliable fighter. He's so agile and nimble; I can always count on him when I'm in a bind.
#823$#One of these days, I'm going to ask him for some combat advice.|
42056|#824$#There's this... intensity about Merrilee that always makes me feel a bit nervous...|
42061|What do you think is better about having four legs?|
42062|Is there anything special about your horse shoes?|
42063|#824$#You know, you're the first one to ask me anything about my wonderful hooves. Why is that?|
42064|#822$#I suppose the only real benefit about having four legs is that you run a lot faster.|
42065|#821$#My hoofbeat clops like the hammer of a gavel, thrumming the pace of justice!
#823$#Perhaps I should become a poet! Do you agree?|
42066|#823$#I run three times faster than the fastest normal horse! Isn't that amazing? I think so!
#821$#O-oh, my proof? Hmm, well, I don't have that on me right now, but I'll show it to you later...|
42071|What do you think about while we're fighting together?|
42072|What do you think about fighting?|
42073|#821$#I always think about how lucky I am to fight at your side. It is my greatest honor.|
42074|#824$#Senseless violence only brings hurt and shame. Unfortunately, life flourishing without the need for defense is unavoidable.
#821$#It's a necessary evil, I suppose. Such a pity.|
42075|#822$#I dislike fighting; so much pain and sorrow comes from it. 
#823$#However, I will not hesitate to use Holy Skewer if it's to defend against evil!|
42076|#823$# If it's for you and justice, I will give my all with every fight!|
42081|Tell me about your armor.|
42082|What do you think about wearing armor?|
42083|#822$#Children seem to love my head gear with its bright colors!
#823$#It makes me chuckle to think about someone else trying to wear my armor.|
42084|#822$#My gold armor is my favorite for defense.
#821$#That and my agility are what protect me from major harm.|
42085|#821$#My armor is so light! That's why I can move so freely.
#823$#Imagine how much faster I could run without all this gear on!|
42086|#823$# Some people say I look better without the armor. Do you agree?|
42091|If you and I were separated...|
42092|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
42093|#824$# Can we not talk about this? It's so sad!|
42094|#824$#If we were ever to truly, permanently separate from each other, 
#824$#I would probably disappear from this world.|
42095|#822$#If I were to disappear, please don't be sad.
#821$#My spirit will always be with you.|
42096|#824$#On the day we part, I want you to know that I wish you happiness.|
42201|How do you normally train?|
42202|How do you improve your skills?|
42203|#822$#The best training starts with basics.
#823$#Master the basics and everything else will come to you.|
42204|#821$#I train more than my skills. I also train my spirit through meditation.|
42205|#823$#Life is about strength. That is why you must train endlessly.|
42206|#823$#Every moment of leisure is a moment of training lost. Growing strong is nothing special. It is simply effort applied.
#824$#Anyone who believes otherwise is a fool.|
42211|Do you have any weaknesses?|
42212|What is your greatest fear?|
42213|#821$#Fear? I cannot feel fear.
#823$#I will also never surrender.|
42214|#822$#Weaknesses belong to the weak.|
42215|#824$#I am Gigas. I have no need of fears.
#823$#Please, do not insult me.|
42216|#821$#I have told an untruth. I do understand fear.
#823$#I fear that no challenges will remain for me to face one day. Ha. Ha.|
42221|Do you prefer the mountains or the sea?|
42222|Would you rather vacation in the cool mountains or the sunny sea?|
42223|#822$#The mountains.
#823$#The beach is not known for fearsome opponents.|
42224|#821$#As beautiful as this body is, I think the mountains are right.
#824$#The beach sand may compromise my joints.|
42225|#824$#I cannot abide the beach. So many people indulging in sloth, laying about and sunning themselves.
#822$#Where is the discipline? Where is the self-control?|
42226|#822$#If I had to choose, the mountains.
#821$#You would be better served by training than going to either place, though.|
42231|Do you know how to be gentle?|
42232|What do you think of gentle people?|
42233|#823$#I know a little of being gentle. For example, I never let my opponents suffer.|
42234|#821$#It is strange. Gentle people often seem to fear me.
#824$I find it rude.|
42235|#824$#I can appreciate gentle people.
#822$#Not wishing harm on others is admirable, if foolhardy.|
42236|#822$#Gentle people still desire to protect those they care about.|
42241|What do you think of power?|
42242|What is power to you?|
42243|#823$#Power is my reason for living.
#821$#Power grants you victory, and power prevents needless conflict.|
42244|#821$#Power is a tool, defined by the user. It is a neutral force.|
42245|#822$#Power is a type of philosophy.
#821$#In gaining it, you learn of the world and the people in it.|
42246|#824$#Life is a contest of power. Those with it prevail, those without fail.|
42251|What do you know about the Templars?|
42252|Hey, tell me something about the Templars.|
42253|#822$#They can be admired. It requires great power and skill to be a Templar. 
#823$#I do wish to challenge one someday.|
42254|#822$#The Templars understand the importance of power.
#821$#They are an impressive military force.|
42255|#821$#Becoming a Templar is a difficult task, requiring much work.|
42256|#824$#It has been said that the Templars have a dark past, but it is the present by which all should be judged.|
42261|Tell me about some of the places you've seen.|
42262|Where have you traveled?|
42263|#822$#I have a certain fondness for the Ventos Prairie.
#824$#It is unfortunate I despise the Makar.|
42264|#821$#The Triatio Highlands intrigue me. They are home to skilled hunters.|
42265|#822$#The Demarech Mines... they make me nostalgic.
#823$#I can feel the power of the Cube of Gaia there. I wonder if it is buried in the depths...|
42266|#824$#Candeo Marsh is a terrible place. I avoid it as much as possible.|
42271|What can you tell me about the Auction House?|
42272|Give me some advice regarding the Auction House.|
42273|#823$#It is a useful tool, used to buy and sell items. I know little of it, though.|
42274|#821$#You should learn about the Auction House. Consider it financial training.|
42275|#822$#Navea's Auction House is the largest I have seen.
#821$#Almost too large, I would say.|
42276|#824$#You should learn the market. What prices are fair? Which are competitive?
#822$#Wealth is another form of power - one the world is very quick to recognize.|
42281|How do I make my equipment sparkle?|
42282|Tell me about Fortification.|
42283|#821$#Fortification is critical to growth. Fragments you get from disassembling equipment can be used to fortify weapons and armor.
#823$#Make sure to convert useless gear.|
42284|#822$#Even if Fortification fails, the equipment's potential will still increase slightly.
#821$#When the accumulated potential reaches 100, that item will level.|
42285|#822$#When an item is fortified, its power increases.
#823$#A fully fortified weapon will shine.|
42286|#824$#Equipment Fortification is based on luck, so don't worry if it doesn't go right.|
42291|What do you do when you explore?|
42292|How do you find interesting things?|
42293|#821$#Training.
#822$#The world is your training grounds. You will find interesting things simply by pushing yourself.|
42294|#822$#Listen to what people say. 
#821$#You'll hear interesting things.
#823$#One person's problem is another's opportunity.|
42295|#821$#Everyone is different.
#822$#Learn from them and become stronger for it.|
42296|#821$#The extraordinary is merely the ordinary with training.
#823$#Never stop growing.|
42301|Do you like to eat?|
42302|How much do you usually eat in a day?|
42303|#822$#My spirit is able to absorb energy directly from the ether, allowing me to function forever.|
42304|#823$#Eating is the process by which humans generate energy. Good fuel helps a machine run at its peak, and so it is with humans.|
42305|#822$#Speaking of food, you should eat better.
#824$#A sound mind and sound body are achieved by sound eating.|
42306|#821$#My own body weight remains constant, in spite of energy intake.
#823$#I often hear humans lament that it is not so for them.|
42311|How strong are you, anyway?|
42312|How much can you lift?|
42313|#821$#A subject I enjoy speaking on!
#822$#I once carried a mountain...down a mountain.|
42314|#822$#My strength rivals that of the Cube of Gaia.
#823$#In other words, I am nearly invincible.|
42315|#823$#"Dost thou even lift?", spirits would query, my reply to which was to hoist and throw them into the air.|
42316|#823$#Must you ask? I am the strongest Eidolon. I feel no pain, and my body is impervious to lasting harm.|
42321|Will your body ever rust?|
42322|How do you maintain your armor?|
42323|#822$#Even enchanted metal cannot fully escape the passage of time.
#821$#But unless I was negligent, self-maintenance is simple.|
42324|#821$#I oil and polish myself daily.
#822$#Do not confuse this with pampering. It is ensuring the quality of my body.|
42325|#823$#If I were negligent in my upkeep, I might develop a dignified patina.|
42326|#824$#This armor is the container of my soul. To let myself rust would be unthinkable.|
42331|Have you ever cried?|
42332|What sorts of things make you cry?|
42333|#822$#Tears are for when you lack power.
#823$#There is no shame in it, but it is a sign you must continue to grow.|
42334|#823$#I yield. I have shed a tear after surpassing my limits. There is no shame in joy.|
42335|#821$#Victory can be worth a tear or two of joy.
#822$#It is not my taste, but I can understand.|
42336|#824$#It fills me with sorrow when my opponents are weak.|
42341|Hey, what do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42342|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42343|#822$#Uzuriel is a master warrior. Her form is perfect. Her movements are flawless.
#821$#Her battles are like art.|
42344|#822$#Bahadur once led a ruthless, powerful army.
#822$#The mountains themselves would shake when his troops moved.|
42345|#822$#Tigerius Caesar is arrogant, but skilled.
#823$#Former enemies have sworn themselves to him in exchange for training.|
42346|#824$#Quelkulan? His dark arts and toxins would not avail him against me. Let us not speak of him.|
42351|Has your massive frame ever been a hindrance?|
42352|Is there anything you don't like about being so huge?|
42353|#822$#It is annoying that so many people fear me.
#824$#I am quite kind.|
42354|#821$#Birds mistake me for a tree at times.
#823$#It is not really an annoyance, though.|
42355|#822$#Doorways prove problematic at times.|
42356|#823$#Since I am so big, people trust me to pick up their slack in a fight.|
42361|Do you have hobbies aside from training?|
42362|Anything interest you besides training?|
42363|#821$#Singing is a human pursuit that fascinates me.
#823$#It is my shameful secret, but my voice is magnificent. It would be a waste to not use.|
42364|#822$#I like to help people.
#821$#There is a limitless challenge in reacting to every unique problem someone might have.|
42365|#822$#Problem solving.
#823$#Come, why not try it out with me?|
42366|#824$#Believe it or not, I do rest now and again.|
42371|Why do you hate snakes so much?|
42372|What do you hate about snakes?|
42373|#821$#Serpents are weak. They do not even lift.|
42374|#822$#They are weak and lazy creatures.
#824$#They rely on venom to defeat their foes.|
42375|#823$#What is there to like about them?|
42376|#821$#Who would not hate a miserable tube of meat?
#824$#They are, essentially, lizards too lazy to walk.|
42381|Where do you get your power?|
42382|What gives you energy?|
42383|#822$#A subject I enjoy!
#823$#The power of my body is derived from the power of my spirit. A strong will develops a strong body.|
42384|#821$#This node on my chest is a fragment of the Cube of Gaia. It supplements my own power.
#822$#If need be, I can draw upon it to become even stronger.|
42385|#822$#I am capable of harnessing power from the Cube of Gaia and using it as my own.|
42386|#824$#The Cube of Gaia is key to my strength.|
42391|If you and I were separated...|
42392|What will happen to you if we were to ever part ways?|
42393|#821$#I would continue to train and help others.|
42394|#823$#Even if we were to physically part, I would remain with you in spirit.|
42395|#822$#I won't be surprised when that day comes.
#823$#We will still have our responsibilities to attend to.|
42396|#824$#If I fail, then I expect you to replace me with someone stronger.|
42501|What are your thoughts on family?|
42502|What does family mean to you?|
42503|#822$# No one knows you better than family.
#822$# Not only do they support you, but they are the most important people in your life.|
42504|#823$# I consider anyone that cares about me and anyone I cherish to be family.|
42505|#821$# You should really trust your family.
#822$# Regardless of their faults, they always have your best interests at heart.|
42506|#824$# Family are those who you will never betray, no matter what.|
42511|What kind of weather do you like?|
42512|What kind of weather makes you feel most at ease?|
42513|#821$# I adore those warm, sunny days. Nothing graces the land with such tender warmth like hearty sunshine.
#822$# Such days inspire me to strum a little tune, sing the joys of love and laughter, and relax.|
42514|#822$# The breeze on a brisk autumn day is like a waltz - comforting and invigorating.|
42515|#822$#I feel most content under a clear blue sky.
#823$#The sun blankets the landscape in unflawed, comforting warmth.|
42516|#824$#I dislike the rain. Storm clouds blot out the sky like a cloak over my heart.|
42521|Are you an effective liar?|
42522|How good are you at deception?|
42523|#822$#If you can successfully lie to yourself, then you can successfully lie to anyone.
#824$#However, if you cannot trust yourself, who in this world can you trust?|
42524|#821$#A person's mood gives clues to their heart. Pleasantries always offer plenty of distraction.
#822$#A person that succumbs to your flattery is like putty in your hands.|
42525|#822$#Lying always turns against you in the end. Why would you want to learn more about it?
#821$#Instead, why not be truthful? Sometimes it takes more skill and courage to say what is really on your mind.|
42526|#824$#I told a lie once, to someone dear to me. If only I knew how much that lie would hurt her...|
42531|Do you like to shop?|
42532|Do you like to go shopping with people?|
42533|#821$#I am indifferent about shopping.
#822$#To me, it is a necessity best performed at a leisurely pace.|
42534|#821$#I don't mind shopping with others, but I typically do such a thing by myself.|
42535|#822$#Usually others will not shop with me, not the other way around.
#824$#I radiate too much heat. It makes others around me too uncomfortable.|
42536|#824$# I used to go shopping all the time with someone quite dear to me...|
42541|Have you ever joined any clubs?|
42542|What is your experience in community service?|
42543|#821$#I was once part of an orchestra. Oh, those lively days...
#823$#At that time, we were... modestly famous.|
42544|#822$#My role in the orchestra was playing the harp.
#823$#I'm normally not one to boast, but I do recall my music compelling even small animals to dance...|
42545|#821$#I was lead harp in my orchestra, and was even a part-time conductor. 
#823$#Every time I was chosen to conduct, our performance was a hit.|
42546|#824$#It would bring me great joy to play the harp for an orchestra again someday.|
42551|What do you think is special about the Altar of the Moon?|
42552|What do you know about the Altar of the Moon?|
42553|#821$#The Crescent Gem to which the Altar of the Moon is consecrated has enough power to unravel the seal. 
#822$#The land's history is plagued with battles between tribes vying for that Gem.|
42554|#824$#Perhaps this is just my selfish,
#823$#but I've always liked to imagine that the Altar of the Moon could one day return my sister to me.|
42555|#822$#Every year, Lunarin throws a magical little celebration at the Altar of the Moon.
#821$#Aside from receiving the blessings of ancient warriors departed,
#823$#they share energy with every resident of the village.|
42556|#822$#Perhaps the Cube of Gaia took special care with this place while creating the world.
#821$#It would explain why the Power of Gaia saturates the Altar of the Moon.|
42561|Do you know anything about rare elite monsters?|
42562|What advice do you have about rare elite monsters?|
42563|#822$#Rare elite monsters are stronger than normal monsters, thus tougher to defeat. Defeating one of them requires a bit of skill.|
42564|#821$#Despite how difficult it is to defeat rare elite monsters, there is a benefit in it.
#823$#There is a much greater chance to obtain very rewarding items from them.|
42565|#821$#Garrison members are stationed at every village. They oversee the demise of rare elite monsters. 
#823$#Simply report your kill to one of these garrison members, and you will receive a generous reward.|
42566|#824$#So many monsters roam the lands these days, including rare elite monsters.
#823$#As such, if you see someone struggling with a rare elite, do your best to lend a hand!|
42571|What do you know about point allocation?|
42572|Give me some advice about point allocation.|
42573|#821$#Investing your Attack Points to SPD can effectively shorten casting time with certain skills.|
42574|#823$#There are no restrictions to attack point allocation. Use them where it best suits you!|
42575|#821$#Allocating your Defense Points to HP is an effective way to increase your HP!|
42576|#822$#There are no conditions to resetting your points. Freely play around with your stats to what best suits you!|
42581|Do you know anything about Set Bonuses?|
42582|I would like some info on Set Bonuses.|
42583|#823$#Collect and equip matching set gear. When you have a full set, you unlock special abilities!|
42584|#821$#Gear of the same set will be labeled with the same name.|
42585|#822$#You can find gear of the same set in a general store. Feel free to purchase them at level.|
42586|#824$#Nothing is more bothersome than knowing you are one piece away from gaining a full set bonus!|
42591|Can you give me some advice about dungeons?|
42592|What do you know about dungeons?|
42593|#821$#Daily raiding times are limited, so be sure to come prepared before entering.|
42594|#822$#Keep in mind that monsters in dungeons are much more difficult to defeat than ones out in the world. I wish you luck!|
42595|#823$#There is a chance to obtain very good, rare items from defeating monsters in dungeons. I find this quite enticing.|
42596|#823$#There are few things that bring more joy than surviving a dungeon to its end.|
42601|Have you ever slept in?|
42602|How do you normally wake up in the morning?|
42603|#824$#Lately, I rise as the sun just begins to peek over the horizon. Do you find this unusual?|
42604|#823$#I can proudly say that I've never wasted a day by sleeping in.|
42605|#822$#I tend to rise earlier in the summer and later in the winter.|
42606|#821$#There are times when I actually wish I could sleep a little longer, but I don't think that's possible.
#824$#I can't imagine missing a sunrise, to not start my day with such glory.|
42611|Do you have any regrets?|
42612|What is one thing in your life you wish you could change?|
42613|#822$# Everyone harbors regrets in their hearts. It's how one deals with those regrets that's important.
#821$#I'm certain that you, too, have done something you've regretted.|
42614|#822$#Dwelling over regret is rather pointless; you can't take such actions back.
#821$#Instead, it is best to learn from those mistakes to prevent similar situations from occurring again.|
42615|#824$#Please forgive me, my sister...|
42616|#824$#I'd... rather not discuss this right now...|
42621|What instrument do you play the best?|
42622|What is your favorite instrument?|
42623|#821$#I can play many different instruments, but I am best at the harp.|
42624|#822$#Every time I brush my fingers against those harp strings, surrounding animals stop to listen, transfixed by such beautiful sound.
#821$#Just thinking about it soothes my heart.|
42625|#821$#I excel at the harp, an instrument with its origins in my hometown.
#823$#What is truly astonishing about the harp is that you can use it as both an instrument of music and an instrument of war.|
42626|#824$#I sigh with both heart and soul whenever I hear melancholy sounds from a harp.|
42631|Why do you cover your face?|
42632|Is there a reason why you don't show your face?|
42633|#822$#I have vowed to never show my face until I have fulfilled an oath I've set long ago.
#821$#I will not remove this cowl until my oath is fulfilled.|
42634|#821$#Indeed, there is a reason behind this...|
42635|#824$#My crimson cloak symbolizes the blood oath I took long ago.
#822$#It is a constant reminder of what I must fulfill.|
42636|#824$#I promise you, sister, I will find you...|
42641|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42642|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42643|#822$#I've found Kotonoha to be quite charming, with a kind heart and a tender singing voice.
#821$#I can understand why many are so fond of her.|
42644|#822$#I have heard that Yarnaros can manipulate poisons
#822$#and that his greatest joy is flying.|
42645|#821$#Sigrun gains most of her power from the runes etched on her sword and shield.
#823$#Her fighting prowess is like a raging snowstorm, such chilling efficiency.|
42646|#824$#Though Bel-Chandra's dance is graceful and beautiful, 
#824$#every movement of her body brings forth thunder and destruction. I find it difficult to respect her talent because of that.|
42651|What goals do you have?|
42652|What do you want to achieve in life?|
42653|#821$#I have hurt someone very dear to me.
#824$#I would like a chance to apologize to her and atone for my sins against her.|
42654|#821$#I will find her without a doubt. This is my ultimate goal.|
42655|#822$#I wish with all my heart that I can undo the mistakes I have made.
#824$#I cannot think about or do anything else before I atone for those mistakes.|
42656|#822$#This world is full of people weighed down by remorse and regret.
#823$#By shining sunlight into their hearts, I hope I can guide them from the darkness of despair.|
42661|Is your armor enchanted?|
42662|Why do you always wear that armor?|
42663|#823$#This armor brings forth the the light of healing.|
42664|#821$#This armor is forged from my repentance. It helps me bring warmth to this dark world.|
42665|#822$#This armor holds my sins around me like a heavy shackle.
#821$#Only when I have finally washed away my sins will I be ale to shed this heavy burden.|
42666|#824$#These tainted hands carry too much blood to justify healing anyone with.
#824$#Only through my armor can I mend the hearts and souls of others.|
42671|How hot do you get?|
42672|How hot do your flames get?|
42673|#822$#With maximum power, the heat that generates from me is comparable to the surface of the sun.
#823$#Most enemies incinerate with that much heat.|
42674|#822$#Though my flame can melt stone, I cannot risk hurting someone with it.
#821$#I use such heat only as a last resort.|
42675|#822$#Rather than burn, my flame soothes the soul, casting a light that chases away the darkness in one's heart.
#823$#This is my method of healing.|
42676|#824$#No matter how effective my flame is, it does nothing for personal matters of the heart.|
42681|What do you do at night?|
42682|How do you spend your evenings?|
42683|#822$#My sister rules the hours between sunset and sunrise. She only appears when the stars are out.
#824$#I try to see her every night, but she always eludes me.|
42684|#824$#Nothing reminds me more of my biggest mistake in life than these long, dark nights.|
42685|#821$#I do my best to keep a tranquil peace of mind after sunset, 
#824$#but my thoughts always drift to a certain dark period of my past.|
42686|#822$#I do my best to reduce my body heat at night so as to not disrupt the balance of nature - the cooling of things after sunset.|
42691|If you and I were separated...|
42692|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
42693|#821$#You are an outstanding Envoy of Gaia. As long as you continue to work hard and stay true to yourself, you'll have the power to change the world.
#823$#Should we ever part, I know that you will lead a glorious life.|
42694|#822$#After we part, I will travel the world, playing sweet melodies to those that will listen.
#821$#It is my wish to deliver warmth to people's hearts.|
42695|#821$#If such a time truly arrives, I will play music of utmost honor and respect in your name.|
42696|#822$#Should we part, I will continue to look for my sister.
#824$#I will not cease until I can finally rest my eyes upon her and voice my words of apology.|
42801|What is a brave warrior to you?|
42802|What kind of person makes brave warrior?|
42803|#822$# Do you even need to ask? Just look at me!
#821$# I'm the mightiest Eidolon of them all!|
42804|#821$#A true warrior does not allow fear or harm or death to prevent them from carrying out their duty.
#822$#We fight not for ourselves, but for a greater whole which depends on each doing their part.|
42805|#822$# Are you blind?
#821$# I am bravery incarnate!
#822$#Ha! You should really get your eyes checked out.|
42806|#822$#There is no need for you to discreetly praise me like this.
#821$#I am clever enough to know precisely what you mean. Others... are not.
#822$#If you wish to praise others, it would be better to do so directly.|
42811|Do you like animals?|
42812|What do you think of animals?|
42813|#822$#Animals, you say? They do not tend to cross my mind often.
#822$#They are living beings, as you are - man and animal should assist each other's survival.|
42814|#822$#If I were to select a 'favorite' animal, it might be the mountain ram.
#821$#Upon bare rocks he loses not his footing, and his charge lays low his enemy.|
42815|#822$#There are not many animals I have a special like for, but there are many I hold in disdain, such as rats.
#823$#Scavengers of food, spreaders of disease...
#822$#Have they any noble purpose in this world?|
42816|#822$# I don't mind rabbits, especially when they're roasted. Rabbit fur is also quite warm and comfortable.
#824$# It is a pity that they are so small. I would need to eat several rabbits in one sitting to feel full.|
42821|Are you an effective liar?|
42822|How good are you at deception?|
42823|#822$#Do I look like a liar to you?
#822$#I took to the battlefield in such an era where a warrior's word was his bond, and I live by that principle still.
#824$#Truly, you wound me, imagining me some spinner of falsities!|
42824|#822$#Do I look like the type who has lies to tell?
#823$#You...appear skeptical still, I see.
#822$#Events are remembered by individuals, and it is possible for individuals to have their own truths that sometimes contradict. Such is the way of memory.|
42825|#822$#I sense no ill intent from you, so I will answer you in a civil manner.
#821$#I do not lie.
#822$#Telling untruths profits me nothing. The currencies I value - honor, virtue, temperance - are not honed by a liar's tongue.|
42826|#822$#I am no deceiver, I assure you.
#821$#I may not remember things with perfect clarity, but I do not intentionally omit details.
#822$#If someone corrects me, and they have proof of what they say, I will accept them.|
42831|What would you do if you encountered a very powerful enemy?|
42832|How do you deal with a powerful enemy?|
42833|#822$#I have retreated, but never been defeated.
#821$#The key is to try many types of assault. See what the enemy can deal with - and what they cannot.|
42834|#821$# How dare you compare me to regular people! I'm the strongest Eidolon of them all, for god's sake!
#822$# Compared to me, everyone else is weak!|
42835|#821$#I deal with powerful foes the same way I deal with all foes: the martial skills I have honed over eons.
#822$#Technology may change with the times, but the principles that win fights generally do not.|
42836|#822$#Oh? Are you worried we shall cross paths with an unbeatable foe?
#821$#No enemy shall overcome me.
#822$#You may be at ease in my presence, for the greatest foe is not without, but within.|
42841|What are your weaknesses?|
42842|Do you have any weaknesses?|
42843|#822$#Assuming for a moment I had secret vulnerabilities, what warrior in their right mind would tell of their own weaknesses?
#821$#I have nothing you would think of as a vulnerability.|
42844|#823$#Weakness? I was...perhaps vulnerable once, strong but imperfect.
#821$#This armor is a testament to that, and it offers up no weakness.|
42845|#822$#Does the question burn so deeply within you?
#821$#Some would say my cup is all too full of pride, and that such is my weakness.
#822$#But I assure you, I make no declarations my skills cannot support.|
42846|#822$#Very well, come closer, and I shall tell you of my one weakness.
#821$#My weakness is... ... Yes, just as I said.
#822$#What's that? You didn't hear me? Well, I did say to come closer, didn't I?|
42851|What's special about Vulture's Vale?|
42852|What can you tell me about Vulture's Vale?|
42853|#824$# Vulture's Vale? The name sounds familiar... Hmm, let me think...|
42854|#822$# Vulture's Vale? Apparently it's the site of a huge battle.
#821$# As mightiest of the Eidolons, I'm not gonna miss that party!|
42855|#821$# The scenery in Vulture's Vale is amazing - the magnificent wilderness and waterfalls there are just breathtaking.
#823$# If I had to pick one spot to be a battleground... Vulture's Vale would be my choice!|
42856|#821$# Vulture's Vale is in the northern part of the continent.
#824$# If you want to go there with your current skill level... I'm afraid I'll have to go along to protect you.|
42861|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
42862|What can you tell me about the Aura Kingdom?|
42863|#822$# Hmm? I never thought you'd be interested in that sort of place.
#824$# It's very peaceful and quiet there - to me, it's the definition of "boring"...|
42864|#823$# The Aura Kingdom? I've heard it's full of skilled warriors!
#821$# Still, they're no match for me!|
42865|#824$# The Aura Kingdom... I sure do miss living there...|
42866|#822$# Hmm... I suppose I can tell you about the Aura Kingdom... That is, if you really want to know...
#824$# The Aura Kingdom is a place of beauty and light. I'll never understand why humans are so curious about the Aura Kingdom...|
42871|I'd like to know about the Holy Chest.|
42872|Tell me what you know about the Holy Chest.|
42873|#821$#You may think of the Holy Chest as a large container for your gold quality weapons.
#823$#And if you put the gold quality weapon with certain fortification level in the Holy Chest, you'll gain extraordinary power!|
42874|#822$# Hmm? Holy Chest? Ah, you're asking the right person!
#823$# First, try fortifying one of your gold-quality weapons. When it's ready, put it in the Holy Chest and see what happens!|
42875|#822$# But only a few chosen Envoys of Gaia are strong enough to handle the Holy Chest and its enormous power.
#821$# I think you'll handle the Holy Chest just fine, as long as you have me by your side.|
42876|#822$# Holy Chest? I'm fine without that sort of thing.
#821$# But I'm sure it will be a big help to you.|
42881|I'd like to know about Masteries.|
42882|Tell me about Masteries.|
42883|#823$# Masteries? Ha - I'm masterful at everything!
#821$# I'll show you a thing or two sometime.|
42884|#821$# There are a number of Class Masters in Navea.
#822$# If you ever feel like your fighting skills could use a boost, go talk to them.|
42885|#823$# Choose Masteries that will help you develop your skills to their utmost.
#821$# They'll play an even more important role when you start visiting Dungeons.|
42886|#822$# Masteries not only add new effects to your skills, they also boost your stats.
#821$# Collect as many Masteries as you can on your adventures!|
42891|I'd like to know about the Login Reward System.|
42892|What's special about Login Rewards?|
42893|#823$# Login Reward System? Sounds like it's designed just for me!
#824$# The Login Reward System gives you an incentive to meet up with me more often!|
42894|#822$# You'll be rewarded handsomely for logging in daily.
#821$# It's a really easy way to get rewards... Don't say I didn't tell you!|
42895|#822$# Login Rewards? What's that?|
42896|#822$# Well, the Login Reward System has lots of benefits. I'll tell you about it.
#821$# You'll be rewarded handsomely for logging in daily.
#823$# Not only can you get free items from the Item Mall, you may even get extra Dragon Points!|
42901|I hear that you're invincible. Is this true?|
42902|I hear that nothing can harm you. Is this true?|
42903|#821$#Of course it's true. No weapon can hurt me!
#822$#Don't believe me? Then hit me with your best shot!|
42904|#822$#Of course it's true! I'll bet you wish you were as impervious.
#821$#To be invincible, you must first look invincible - and in that I cut a fine figure.
#824$#You, on the other hand... perhaps, if you train hard for the next 100 years, you too can be untouchable...|
42905|#822$#It is impossible for someone to be impeccably handsome, undeniably strong, AND possess a charming character!
#821$#But if anyone WERE to have those traits in equal measure, surely I would be a top contender.|
42906|#822$#I am confused as to why you would ask such a question.
#822$#Surely you've noticed my lack of injuries...
#824$#It breaks my heart that you have failed to notice the splendor of my battles!|
42911|Have you ever been defeated?|
42912|I've heard that you've never been defeated.|
42913|#822$#You are joking, right? I am Abraxas, unconquerable under heaven.
#821$#The being has not been born that can subdue my proud spirit.|
42914|#822$#The rumor of my flawless record is absolutely true!
#821$#Spirits fall before my might, and humans ten times so.|
42915|#823$#Are you actually questioning my ability?
#821$#Though I have contemplated lessons I might learn from defeat, I have not actually been bested in combat.|
42916|#822$#Is the answer not obvioius? Have you not heard the stories?
#821$#I return from battle after battle, bearing nary even a scratch.|
42921|Your armor looks so cool!|
42922|You have amazing armor.|
42923|#821$#Haha, I know!
#822$#How could someone so handsome cover his flawless beauty with armor?
#821$#I could never have borne it, except by commissioning a suit of armor so stylish, even my fellows in the Aura Kingdom were jealous.|
42924|#822$#I see even humans are capable of fine taste!
#821$#This armor was crafted in the aether-forges of the Aura Kingdom.
#822$#Its cost cannot be fathomed - a king's treasury would scarcely buy a finger-plating.|
42925|#822$#This armor is not just for looks, you know.
#821$#It's light and exceedingly durable. It is armor meant to be lived in.|
42926|#822$#Oh? Do you want to look just like me?
#824$#Sadly, I cannot help you - this armor was a custom-fitted gift of great worth.
#822$#Hopefully you will one day find raiment as fitting for yourself.|
42931|What weapons are you best with?|
42932|What are your favorite weapons?|
42933|#822$#A prudent question, but unnecessary.
#821$#All the weapons and devices of man are known to me, and many wholly unknown to man.
#823$#Watch, and learn.|
42934|#822$#I have trained extensively in all manner of weaponry.
#821$#As long as there is war, there will be weapons, and as long as there are weapons, I will master them and turn them against evil.|
42935|#821$#I have knowledge of weapons that are, that have been, and even weapons that have yet to be.|
42936|#822$#I excel at using all weapons.
#821$#However, one's body is the perfect, original weapon, and so it is with my body that I subdue my foes.|
42941|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
42942|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
42943|#821$#The mysterious messenger Nalani can communicate not only with animals, but with plants.
#822$#I wonder what manner of things plants have to say...|
42944|#822$#Zaahir radiates a heat like the earth's very mantle!
#824$#So intense is it that even I would not venture too near him unbidden.
#822$#I would not be surprised if the sensation of coldness is unknown to him.|
42945|#823$#Between you and me, I suspect that Tsubaki may not be a woman.
#822$#She always looks at me with such disdain, such...disinterest.
#822$#No swoons, no sighs...how else does one explain such strange behavior?|
42946|#824$#I am afraid I cannot give a good answer.
#822$#Gossip is sometimes seen as...less than noble, among the spirits.
#822$#Though if you seek an angel with great knowledge of hidden secrets, I can recommend Uzuriel.|
42951|You have an amazing kick!|
42952|Where did you learn to kick like that?|
42953|#822$#Thank you for noticing!
#821$#I've spent my entire life perfecting my kick - it's as basic a bodily function as breathing now.|
42954|#821$#Of course you would think so! You pursued my aid and secured it, and I am not one to disappoint.|
42955|#822$#I humbly and honorably accept your compliment - flattery though it may be.|
42956|#822$#There is more about me fit to amaze than simply my kicks.
#821$#My intelligence and stunning good looks are a killer pair, if I say so myself.|
42961|Are you able to sit down?|
42962|What do you need to do to sit?|
42963|#824$#Why is it that you persist in knowing only insignificant details about me?
#822$#Just focus on the big picture, like how majestic I look as I strike down mighty foes.|
42964|#822$#That is possibly the most unusual question you've asked me yet.
#821$#When there is reason to sit, I sit. When I wish to stand, I stand.
#822$#Why is this important to you? You're quite the strange one...|
42965|#822$#You must have the impression that my armor restricts some motions.
#821$#It is not so, however, because within the armor my soul has no fleshly form.
#822$#Standing does not make me tired, and I am more prepared for battle that way - thus, I stand.|
42966|#822$#Why fret over such a trivial thing?
#821$#Look at me! Such a lithe form, such a radiant presence! When one can stand tall, they ought to stand and shake the heavens.|
42971|What do you look like under all that armor?|
42972|I wonder what you look like underneath the armor...|
42973|#821$#I'm fairly certain that you wouldn't be able to handle such perfect beauty, so I thoughtfully spare you such emotional turmoil.
#822$#Really, though...before I took up this armor, I was widely considered irresistably handsome.
#824$#I wish I could show you...|
42974|#822$#The closer you look, the less you'll see.
#821$#Where once I clothed myself in beauty, now I wear the raiment of mystery.|
42975|#822$#In a great battle, long ago, I was grievously injured, to the brink of death.
#822$#My body could not be saved, but my eternal soul became the heart of this armor.
#821$#I was glad to live, but sad it came at the cost of my former beauty...|
42976|#822$#I have heard among humans that "familiarity breeds contempt".
#821$# If would be a shame if you were to tire of me because all the mystery was gone, wouldn't it?|
42981|How are you able to float like that?|
42982|What makes you able to fly?|
42983|#821$# Well, it's really nothing. I'm the strongest Eidolon of them all!|
42984|#822$#Oh? Do you wish to fly?
#822$#I was born with this ability, but you...
#824$#Perhaps it would be better if you contented yourself with a good sprint.|
42985|#822$#It is quite splendid, to hover or soar in the sky.
#821$#There's really nothing to it.
#821$#Perhaps one day, your spirit will travel to the Aura Kingdom, and you can fly as well.|
42986|#822$#I shan't bore you with the details.
#821$#But did you expect someone from the Aura Kingdom to be bound to the earth?|
42991|If you and I were separated...|
42992|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
42993|#822$#I would return to the Aura Kingdom, most likely.
#821$#There is never a shortage of evil that must be vanquished.|
42994|#822$#Are you thinking of leaving me? Surely you jest!
#823$#Who else could you spend time with who's as witty, intelligent, or dashing?
#824$#Is this what the cold pang of rejection feels like?|
42995|#824$#You're thinking much too far ahead.
#822$#Life is meant to be lived in the present. Let us continue on and see what new challengies lie in store.|
42996|#822$#You need not worry about my welfare.
#821$#Before I met you, I fought alone, and I suppose I can return to being a solitary soldier.|
43101|Opinion on warriors.|
43102|How should a warrior be like?|
43103|#821$#A warrior should be someone who's loyal to his master, convictions, and beliefs.|
43104|#822$#A warrior is someone who has the power to protect what's important, and guards everyone else with his own life.|
43105|#821$#Other than a strong body, a warrior must possess an unflinching will too.|
43106|#822$#A warrior must uphold the code of warriors.|
43111|What do you like to do?|
43112|What are your hobbies?|
43113|#821$#I like to train in the morning, you can join my training as well.
#822$#That way, you'll be much more resistant to diseases.|
43114|#822$#I like to meditate during my spare time.
#821$#Other than contemplating the art of fighting, I enjoy visualizing battle situations as well.|
43115|#823$#Cleaning a Katana is a pleasure!
#822$#My loyal blade shines night and day!|
43116|#821$#I used to roam around during my younger days, now I prefer to stay home and care for my Katana.
#822$#I've collected several exceptional Katanas lately ...
#821$#Ha! Just talking about them makes me want to go home to polish them.|
43121|Do you have any unimaginable hobby?|
43122|What are your hobbies?|
43123|#823$#Well ... I actually enjoy desserts very much! Especially Dorayaki!
#822$#Soft red bean paste on fluffy pastry ... Delicious!|
43124|#821$#I have an uncontrollable hoarding habit, I love seeking fights and collecting Katanas after winning.
#822$#I treat with care all the Katanas I collect!|
43125|#823$#I love desserts, but it doesn't match my appearance huh! Hahaha!
#821$#I don't really like western desserts like cake or pancakes.|
43126|#822$#Fighting and collecting blades... 
#821$#Is that a hobby? Or is that considered training? Hmm... |
43131|Do you cook?|
43132|What do you eat?|
43133|#823$#Haha! The only thing I know how to make are desserts!
#822$#Such as Dorayaki pastry and Dorayaki filling!|
43134|#822$#I can only make three very mild military dishes.
#821$#There's not enough time and variety of ingredients in a military camp.
#822$#Mostly hunted animals roasted over a spit or dry rations are eaten.|
43135|#822$#I've been a monk before, that's why sometimes I just eat vegetarian food.
#821$#It is to control my appetite and train myself.|
43136|#821$#I'm really good at making desserts!
#822$#Do you want to try my freshly made Dorayaki?|
43141|How heavy can your armor be?|
43142|How heavy is the armor you're wearing?|
43143|#823$#Most people can't bear the heavy armor I can wear!
#821$#But these days I'd like to wear something lighter.|
43144|#822$#Heavy armors are great for protection,
#821$#but I don't want my movements to be restricted.
#822$#I wear heavier armors to train myself during my daily training sessions.
#821$#This way, my movements will be swifter during actual battles.|
43145|#822$#The armor is not particularly heavy on me,
#821$#it just looks bulky, hahaha!|
43146|#821$#Since I train with heavier weights in the morning,
#822$#the armor I'm wearing now does not feel heavy at all.|
43151|What's the Mirabelle Group?|
43152|Please tell me about the Mirabelle Group.|
43153|#822$#I think they post information from every part of the world onto a Bulletin Board,
#821$#and adventurers are welcomed to receive quests from there.|
43154|#822$#It's an association that posts quest requests, you can try it out if you want to.
#821$#Sometimes the quests are quite tricky, you'll have to use your own judgement.|
43155|#822$#It's an association that posts quest requests, I've seen some pretty interesting requests there.
#821$#Such as defeating strong monsters, or monsters from the Otherworld. |
43156|#821$#You can go to the Bulletin Board set up by the Mirabelle Group everywhere
#822$#and receive quests from there.
#821$#I'll go with you so you don't have to worry about anything!|
43161|Please tell me about the Cactakara Forest.|
43162|Do you know the Cactakara Forest?|
43163|#821$#The Cactakara Forest is a forest with two waterfalls,
#822$#it's a charming place with many smaller waterfalls and lakes.|
43164|#822$#It's a lively area with dwarves,
#821$#they go about their lives in vibrant clothes.
#822$#The whole Cactakara Forest looks more lively because of their clothes.|
43165|#821$#The Cactakara Forest has lots of beautiful vegetation and majestic waterfalls!
#822$#People go fishing by the lakes there.|
43166|#822$#It's a great place for meditation and training, I frequent there as well.
#821$#When we have time, we should go and take a look at that peaceful place.|
43171|Tell me more about the Adventurer Medal.|
43172|Do you know about the Adventurer Medal?|
43173|#822$#The Adventurer Medal? During your travels you will encounter Achievement Quests.
#821$#You just have to level up and pass the quests.|
43174|#822$#I'll help you passing the special Adventurer Medal quests,
#821$#you'll get special rewards that way!|
43175|#822$#The Adventurer Medal has a variety of achievement quests.
#821$#I'll train with you,
#822$#I'm sure you'll be able to complete all of them in due time!|
43176|#821$#The completion requirements are different for each Adventurer Medal quests.
#822$#You may train or enhance your equipment,
#821$#I'm sure you'll fulfill those requirements then.|
43181|How do you get rare gear?|
43182|How do you get rare gear?|
43183|#823$#So you're looking for better equipment, eh?
#821$#Just like my thirst for Katana!
#822$#You might obtain rare equipment when you've defeated rare elite monsters.
#821$#I'll go with you.|
43184|#822$#I heard that if you challenge advanced Dungeons,
#821$#you might obtain rare equipment there.|
43185|#821$#Rare equipment?
#822$#You can get them by defeating elite monsters or accumulating enough money.
#821$#Some stores sell rare equipment as well.|
43186|#823$#You can upgrade your skills with me!
#821$#That way, you'll be able to challenge dungeons and obtain rare equipment!|
43191|Is there anything I should know about dungeons?|
43192|Please tell me how to get prepared for dungeons.|
43193|#821$#Do you want to challenge a dungeon?
#822$#Before that, you should boost your equipment.
#821$#What is a handyman without his tools?|
43194|#821$#The monsters within a dungeon are not to be trifled with.
#822$#You should make sure that your healing methods are sufficient.|
43195|#822$#Before conquering a dungeon, you can get ready with me.
#821$#The preparation gives me some XP Crystals,
#822$#and I'll be able to help you with a stronger condition.|
43196|#821$#I heard that treasure boxes may appear after you've defeated monsters.
#822$#Check it out, there might be items to help you through dungeons.|
43201|Have you got seven awesome items?|
43202|Do you use a lot of items?|
43203|#823$#Haha, that's right. I do possess seven items, they're mainly military weapons.
#821$#I don't have them with me all the time though.|
43204|#821$#The seven items are useful weapons during a battle.
#822$#I'm willing to show them to you.|
43205|#821$#That's right! I have a Katana, Bear Claws, Giant Hammer, Spikes, Giant Saw, and an Iron Mace.
#822$#Well, the bear claw is actually a rake.|
43206|#822$#I named all my seven items.
#821$#My Katana is called Magma Crusher.|
43211|I'd like to talk about the origin of the Eidolons.|
43212|Do you want to talk about the origin of the Eidolons?|
43213|#821$#I'm the closest companion of my master.
#822$#There are bountiful shared memories of battle,
#821$#my master is someone I'm willing to follow with my life.|
43214|#822$#I met my master on Gojo Bridge while a Katana hunting.
#821$#My master's powers are supreme and completed my blade training.|
43215|#821$#My master's fighting skills are supreme, and his military strategies are not to be trifled with!
#822$#Especially during the great battle with the Ping Clan,
#821$#it still amazes me to this day.|
43216|#821$#My master treats me very well and trusts me wholeheartedly.
#823$#My greatest happiness is to be able to serve my master.|
43221|The legend states that you were born looking like a toddler already.|
43222|It is true that you were born looking like a toddler?|
43223|#822$#I was born with hair and teeth!
#821$#But that caused a lot of misery and bad memories... |
43224|#822$#Luckily, my aunt wasn't deterred by this and raised me.
#821$#She even gave me the name "Gunjo".|
43225|#821$#Hahaha, how extraordinary.
#823$#Maybe it was a sign that my life would be anything but ordinary!|
43226|#821$#They say that I was born looking like a three year old toddler.
#824$#My father considered me a monster.|
43231|Which battle left you with the deepest impression?|
43232|Which battle left you with the deepest impression?|
43233|#824$#There is always someone who leaves me during a battle.
#821$#Those comrades ... I'm sorry ... I don't want to think about it.|
43234|#822$#Winning the battle against the Ping Clan with my master at Shrine Creek!
#821$#I can't explain the happiness I felt!|
43235|#823$#The fight with master at the Gojo Bridge.
#821$#That battle is the most meaningful encounter in my life.
#822$#That was the place where I've met my master!|
43236|#821$#My master's bravery and wisdom shined through at the battle of Shrine Creek.
#822$#I can still see it in front of me!|
43241|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
43242|Tell me some interesting tidbits about the Eidolons.|
43243|#822$#Due to my reserved warrior's training, I am not that exposed to other Eidolons.
#821$#That's why I don't know more about them.|
43244|#822$#Aelius's armor provides him with an endless power of healing.
#821$#I should discuss this with him.|
43245|#823$#Gigas has the might to hold up the world!
#821$#I'm staggered by such a display of power.|
43246|#821$#Amaterasu has three cultural relics,
#822$#but it seems like she has a peculiar relationship with Kusanagi.
#821$#It's harmonious between her other two artifacts though.|
43251|Was it you who invented Dorayaki?|
43252|Was Dorayaki invented by you?|
43253|#823$#Haha! Speaking of Dorayaki, it was a delicious accident!|
43254|#822$#I was injured and a family took me in to heal me.
#821$#As I was leaving after recovering, I gave them my military gong in gratitude.
#822$#Who could imagine that they would use the gong to cook!
#821$#They put flour on it and made pastry, they filled it with red bean paste and became Dorayaki!|
43255|#821$#It's a delicacy borne out of a gift!
#822$#I miss the taste of red beans so much.|
43256|#823$#It was a happy accident to inspire my saviors to create Dorayaki.|
43261|What's a Katana Hunt?|
43262|Tell me about a Katana Hunt.|
43263|#823$#If I see someone bearing a Katana that I like, I'll challenge them to a duel! I'll obtain the Katana after winning!|
43264|#821$#I've been honing my skills through Katana Hunts.
#822$#It's a great way of training myself while satisfying my thirst for more Katanas!|
43265|#823$#I've collected 999 Katanas through Katana Hunts on the Gojo Bridge!|
43266|#824$#While winning my 999th Katana Hunt Battle on the Gojo Bridge,
#822$#my master came here and I instantly perceived his Katana.
#824$#After challenging him to a duel, I lost to his excellent skills.
#822$#That was how I missed my 1000th Katana.|
43271|You seem very strong.|
43272|How strong do you think you are?|
43273|#823$#I've obtained 999 Katanas by winning duels! I'm considered very strong!|
43274|#822$#I've fought 500 soldiers with seven other comrades to protect my master.
#821$#It was a risky situation but no one backed down!
#822$#It was a battle that throroughly displayed a warrior's loyalty.|
43275|#823$#People call me one of the Elite Four because of my skills!
#822$#Another proof is my master's trust in me.|
43276|#823$#I've fought many battles with him and can use seven weapons.
#822$#That should be a proof of strength, haha!|
43281|What about your Katana?|
43282|Where is your Katana?|
43283|#822$#My Katana, the Magma Crusher...
#821$#I've decided to repair it after a long period of usage.
#822$#It's resting now so I'm not using it!|
43284|#823$#I was wielding Magma Crusher as I defeated the other 999 Katanas.
#822$#Magma Crusher is an important ally, but it's exhausted.
#821$#I'm keeping it aside to repair it.|
43285|#824$#I was holding Magma Crusher in my hands during my 1000th battle.
#822$#But I lost to my master and Magma Crusher has lost to Kintana.
#821$#I've placed Magma Crusher with Kintana,
#824$#master says that the Katanas should train together.|
43286|#821$#Out of all my seven weapons, my Katana Magma Crusher appears on the battlefield the most.
#822$#I've decided to let it rest in case of pushing it to break.|
43291|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
43292|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
43293|#823$#I'll continue my warrior training and roam the earth.|
43294|#822$#I'd like to create more desserts that bring happiness!|
43295|#824$#I'm not looking forward to the day that we part ways... |
43296|#821$#I'll be waiting for the day that we meet again.|
43401|Thoughts about knowledge.|
43402|Is knowledge power?|
43403|#821$#Knowledge is fascinating. If you don't use it wisely,
#822$#it won't ever become power.|
43404|#822$#Since you asked, do you want to earn the power of knowledge?
#823$#You have such a strong curiosity... You certainly are worth following.|
43405|#821$#Knowledge has a power that is greater than you can imagine, but it is limited.
#822$#From my experience,
#824$#most people never use knowledge to its full potential.|
43406|#822$#If you spend your life locked in an ivory tower with your nose in a book,
#824$#you'll never accomplish anything of merit.
#821$#I have personal experience with this.|
43411|How do you view destiny?|
43412|Thoughts about destiny.|
43413|#822$#Destiny can be altered through hard work and determination.
#824$#However, even those who do so may not earn destiny's favor.|
43414|#821$#Destiny's influence surpasses that of any other,
#822$#but that doesn't mean it can't be... influenced.
#821$#From what I can see, you possess the power to alter your own destiny, Master.|
43415|#821$#Sometimes destiny brings beautiful encounters.
#823$#The way we met, for example...
#822$#... Why was I not able to speak to you for a while?|
43416|#821$#We're all puppets of destiny.
#824$#It makes people do absurd and desperate things.
#821$#Fortunately, I cut those strings so that I could have true freedom.|
43421|What do you like to do?|
43422|Do you have any special interests?|
43423|#821$#Transcribing knowledge is one of my obsessive...
#822$#Do you want to see what's in my records? This...
#824$#Oh that's not finished. Sorry about that.|
43424|#821$#The records are perfect. They're like a meaningful conversation.
#823$#It's like your words and thoughts, Master...
#822$#No, I didn't spy on you. Please let me explain!|
43425|#821$#Record anything interesting that you see before you...
#822$#What's that? How do I record without pencil and paper?
#823$#That's... that's a secret.|
43426|#821$#I also love listening to beautiful music.
#822$#... What kind of music do you consider beautiful?
#823$#I like vocal music. Your voice, for example, is music to my ears.|
43431|What kind of art do you like?|
43432|Is there a type of art you prefer?|
43433|#821$#I love majestic operas.
#821$#It's the combination of music and singing, with the added bonus of theatrical performance.
#823$#The soul of these stage performances is intoxicating.|
43434|#821$#Poetry and literature are beautiful arts,
#823$#but I prefer opera as it directly impacts the soul.|
43435|#823$#Master, you are the most profound artist in this world.
#821$#It's your presence that intoxicates me and keeps me by your side... Can I ask where you're going?
#822$#¡K I can't go with you? Why not?|
43436|#821$#Opera is a supreme art form. You know, it's often used to venerate people.
#823$#I hope that one day I will have an opportunity to write a verse for you, Master...
#822$#Wait... where are you going?|
43441|Do you have any unforgettable dreams?|
43442|What was your most memorable dream?|
43443|#821$#I once dreamt that I saw a utopia.
#824$#It was such a beautiful scene. I didn't want to wake up.|
43444|#823$#Seeing you makes me feel like I'm dreaming again...
#821$#You want to know if I have any way to wake myself up during a nightmare?
#822$#But you're awake now!|
43445|#823$#I once saw a kingdom that was the perfect combination of utopia and reality.
#821$#That utopia... has only ever shown up in dreams, however.|
43446|#821$#Seeing ideals become a reality is... a sublime experience.
#823$#I only understood what it was like to have a dream come true after I saw you.|
43451|Do you know what the Cube of Gaia is?|
43452|Thoughts about the Cube of Gaia?|
43453|#821$#The Cube of Gaia is a supreme presence.
#823$#It's a power that no one has the right to meddle with.|
43454|#821$#Asking questions like that... It seems you really do have a thirst for knowledge!
#824$#The Cube of Gaia is the origin of the world. It has a power that can't be explained...
#822$#I sometimes wonder if this power controls destiny as well...|
43455|#823$#I'd like to research this question.
#821$#Can I invite you to join in me in this search for answers?|
43456|#821$#The Cube of Gaia is the starting point for all power.
#824$#It's a power that no one can possess if it's only for selfish reasons.|
43461|Have you heard of the centaurs?|
43462|What is your impression of centaurs?|
43463|#823$#They're rumored to have mastered the art of astrology.
#821$#I, too, have studied the stars.
#823$#I hope to someday have the opportunity to discuss astrology with their foremost experts.|
43464|#821$#The possibilities are mind-boggling.
#823$#It's rumored they can even use it to predict the future! Frankly, it's inspirational.
#821$#If you go visit them, please take me with you.|
43465|#821$#I've heard that the Tree of Life that the centaurs guard is shrouded in mystery.
#823$#I'd like to study this tree if I ever have the chance.|
43466|#821$#Their tribe lives on the Continent of Principia, and they're masters of astrology.
#821$#I'm very curious about the extent of their astrological knowledge...
#823$#If you have the chance to interact with them, please tell me.|
43471|Do you know about Desolate Valley?|
43472|Please tell me more about Desolate Valley.|
43473|#821$#It's rumored that half of that valley is shrouded in sandstorms.
#821$#It's a withered grassland inhabited by ferocious monsters.
#824$#Its extreme weather makes it inhospitable to most normal life forms.|
43474|#821$#Since half of it is concealed with wind and sand, most creatures have either died out, or now avoid the area.
#824$#However, legend has it that deep in the forested mountains, there lives an ancient race.
#823$#If you're willing, please go with me to have a look!|
43475|#821$#I would like learn what they know in person.
#823$#I think it's best to experience a place for one's self.|
43476|#821$#It's so much more informative than reading about it in a book.
#823$#Should we go have a look?|
43481|Do you know about the Gaia Chronicle?|
43482|Please tell me about the Gaia Chronicle.|
43483|#821$#It's rumored to contain a very unique history.
#823$#It's not only a chronicle of the past, present, and future, it also tells of alternate dimensions!
#821$#The pages are scattered, so you must piece together tiny fragments if you have any hope of completing the work.|
43484|#821$#It seems that only Envoys of Gaia can study this history.
#821$#You can seek out the Chronicle Researcher in Navea if you want to know more.
#823$#I'm sure he'd be very happy to explain the details to you.|
43485|#821$#I've heard that it holds records of the histories of alternate dimensions.
#823$#It even includes events from various Eidolons' histories.|
43486|#821$#I've heard that it holds a wealth of Eidolon histories within.
#824$#I wonder if it contains record of my past...|
43491|Do you know about Card Duels?|
43492|Want to have a Card Duel?|
43493|#821$#Are you talking about that magical card game?
#822$#It's so simple, even a child can control the magic and battle other players.
#823$#It's surprisingly innovative.|
43494|#822$#The cards that you can battle with are really fun.
#823$#If it were possible, I'd love to battle a round with you.
#824$#It's just a pity that only humans can use the cards.|
43495|#823$#They're just paper cards, but you can battle with them...
#822$#Don't you think that's a really fun invention?|
43496|#822$#I really want to study the mysteries of the cards.
#821$#I've heard that Navea has a special card association.
#823$#If you have the opportunity to visit them, please take me with you.|
43501|Do you know about making pacts with demons?|
43502|Have you made a pact with a demon?|
43503|#821$#Once, as my life was ending, I made a pact with a demon.
#824$#I wanted to continue striving towards my dream to build a utopia, so I offered my soul.|
43504|#824$#There's nothing in this world that can't be bought and sold.
#821$#But if you're willing to sell your soul,
#823$#you need to find someone who can afford grant you what you desire.|
43505|#824$#It's an extremely dangerous trade.
#821$#But this power is what allowed me to meet my master.
#823$#So... I don't regret it at all.|
43506|#821$#The pact was a turning point for me.
#822$#Deep down, I knew it was a trick. Usually, nothing god can come of making a pact with a demon.
#824$#But if I didn't make it, I'd spend the rest of my life rotting away in an ivory tower with my nose in a book! I made the right choice.|
43511|Do you know about Helen?|
43512|Do you know Helen?|
43513|#822$#Are you talking about the legendary beauty of the distant past who launched a thousand ships?
#823$#I've seen her. All I can say is that her beauty is deserving of its reputation.|
43514|#821$#She is the combination beauty AND truth. I've always thought I'd never see anyone more beautiful, up until I met Master...
#824$#However, after I met you, it all came clear to me.
#823$#I know what it feels like to be in the presence of perfection.|
43515|#821$#I once desperately pursued the Helen in a quest for truth and beauty.
#823$#However, I didn't glimpse the meaning of life until I sacrificed my own.
#822$#Today I was surprised to wake up and find truth and beauty standing before me...|
43516|#821$#I once successfully summoned the remnants of Helen's soul.
#824$#However, they only came together for one night. She disappeared without a trace when the sun rose the next day.
#823$#But, even seeing that beauty for an instant is enough to remember it for an eternity.|
43521|Tell me about your utopia!|
43522|What type of utopia would you like to build?|
43523|#821$#I want to build a free and equal country.
#821$#A place free of pain and sorrow.
#823$#That's what people have in mind when they refer to utopia.|
43524|#821$#Utopia is perfection, and that perfection is sublime.
#823$#Even though most say it's impossible, I'll never give up until I achieve my goal.|
43525|#824$#I was once very close to creating my utopia, but in the end I failed due to my own foolishness...
#822$#Yet even in that failure, I saw a glimmer of hope.
#823$#I'll never give up. I came back to this world to discover new possibilities.|
43526|#821$#I wanted to build my utopia.
#824$#I've suffered so many hardships and setbacks, I almost gave up.
#822$#Now seeing you has restored my hope and fighting spirit.|
43531|Are the rumors true? Do you have the power to control demons?|
43532|I heard that you have the power to control demons...|
43533|#821$#I once made a pact with a demon using our souls as collateral.
#822$#The demon broke the pact, and its power was granted to me.
#824$#However, due to the terms of the contract, we are inseparable. I will never be free of him, nor him of me.|
43534|#821$#If you count that as a win...
#822$#The short answer is yes, I can control demons.
#824$#However, I paid an unimaginable price...|
43535|#822$#Mephistopheles lent me his power and lured me on a journey.
#821$#He showed me a glimpse of my utopia.
#823$#Even now that it has come to an end, I am satisfied.|
43536|#821$#I feel like power is neither inherently good nor evil.
#822$#Demonic power, if used for good ends, is perfectly acceptable.|
43541|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
43542|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
43543|#821$#I heard that Eligos is the king of an entire nation.
#822$#I've long thought about how to discuss my utopia with him.|
43544|#822$#Nazrudin has a unique perspective of etiquette.
#824$#I have to say his understanding of it trumps mine.|
43545|#821$#Ghodroon is surprisingly cheerful, even though he's been toyed with by fate.
#823$#Somehow, he takes it all in stride. I really appreciate this.|
43546|#821$#I love watching everything you do. I don't need anyone else...
#822$#Wait! Don't take that the wrong way... I still respect your privacy!
#822$#You have to believe me!|
43551|You cloak looks really special!|
43552|Your cloak is so special!|
43553|#822$#This is proof of the demon's power.
#824$#It's also a reminder of my past folly.|
43554|#822$#This is proof that I beat the demon and earned his power.
#821$#I gave it the name of the demon, Mephistopheles.|
43555|#821$#This cloak is a manifestation of the demon's power.
#822$#I have given it the name of Mephistopheles.|
43556|#821$#Even though this cloak is a symbol of evil,
#822$#you still seem to look it with appreciation.
#823$#You truly are a noble and perfect master.|
43561|Can you perform some magic for me?|
43562|Can you perform some magic for me?|
43563|#824$#I'm sorry to disappoint you.
#821$#I can't just use my magic to perform tricks whenever I want.
#822$#The magic is dark and dangerous.|
43564|#821$#I channel a demon's power to perform magic.
#822$#It's too dangerous to use it for entertainment's sake.|
43565|#821$#If you want to see someone pull a rabbit out of a top hat,
#824$#I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.
#822$#I'd be a fool to use demonic power for simple parlor simple tricks.|
43566|#824$#The magic is used for destruction, not for show.
#821$#Unless, of course, you enjoy seeing life force consumed by dark magic.|
43571|So, you were once a scholar?|
43572|What did you study before?|
43573|#821$#I used to lock myself in an ivory tower and bury my nose in a book.
#823$#My hubris was unmatched. I vowed to understand and master all the knowledge the world had to offer.
#822$#What a fool I was...|
43574|#822$#Books used to be my life.
#821$#That was the case up until the day of my death.
#824$#Only then did I realize that knowledge is useless if you can't put it to practical use.|
43575|#821$#I was once called a doctor. It was an honorary title for scholars.
#824$#In reality, though, I was but a prisoner staring at shadows on the wall of a cave.|
43576|#822$#I read quite a few books,
#824$#but even if I read more, I still couldn't put that knowledge into practice.|
43581|Is it true? Can you predict the future?|
43582|Can you predict the future?|
43583|#824$#The future that I see may just be an illusion¡Xa possibility. It may not come to be...
#822$#Do you want me to speak more directly? This...
#821$#To put it simply, the future that I see may not necessarily happen.|
43584|#821$#I have seen various possible futures,
#822$#but the ones I have seen are not set in stone.
#823$#I finally had an epiphany. I realized that the future is depends entirely on your choices in the here and now.|
43585|#821$#The future that I have seen bypasses destiny.
#822$#This means it isn't set in stone. It can still be changed. I find that fact comforting.|
43586|#822$#Since you asked me... Do you wish to know your future?
#821$#The things I have seen are not good, so I suggest you think about this.|
43591|If the time has arrived to say goodbye,|
43592|what plans do you have after that?|
43593|#824$#I will continue to pursue the dream of a utopia. I will never give it up.
#821$#You wouldn't abandon your ideals would you?|
43594|#822$#Why did you suddenly say that?
#824$#Did I do something to offend you?|
43595|#824$#I hope that day never comes.
#821$#You're so wonderful, I want to always be at your side.|
43596|#824$#I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude...
#821$#Can we not talk about this? It's upsetting.|
43701|What do you think defines a friend?|
43702|What does being a friend mean to you?|
43703|#821$#I cultivate satisfaction within my own sphere, so that the quality of my life does not depend on what others think of me.|
43704|#821$#Friends...?
#822$#Long ago, I had many friends, and my halls were filled with feasting. Now, I have many servants, but few friends.|
43705|#822$#Friends are helpful, but ultimately, you are the only person you can count on.
#821$#And me, of course.|
43706|#821$#A friend? Perhaps one who shares in the joys and pains of the battlefield; someone who understands the fragility of life.
#822$#I suppose you may be considered a friend, if we fight alongside each other.|
43711|How would you handle an encounter with a powerful enemy?|
43712|What would you do against a powerful foe?|
43713|#821$#I would employ all means to exploit their weaknesses, devious or no.
#822$#I've yet to meet someone who didn't have some trait that could be capitalized on.|
43714|#822$#Are you worried?
#821$#You have no reason to be fearful so long as I'm here.|
43715|#821$#A 'powerful' enemy, you say?
#822$#I don't think I've ever met someone that could be considered 'powerful'.|
43716|#821$#A 'powerful' enemy? This is amusing!
#823$#Someone with power comparable to yours is nothing to me.|
43721|If you could make one wish come true, what would it be?|
43722|What is your greatest wish?|
43723|#821$#Wishes don't come true, everyone knows this.
#823$#Such a pointless question.|
43724|#822$#I've never seen the point in making wishes.
#821$#If it can happen naturally, I can do it.
#822$#If I can't do it, no one else can either.|
43725|#821$#The death of my best friend was one of the saddest moments of my life. If I could make any wish, I'd want my friend back.
#822$#I've done so many things, accomplished so much, but I failed to protect my one and only friend.
#821$#So, above all else, I'd wish for my best friend back.|
43726|#821$#Why bother asking such an unrealistic question? Wishes don't come true like that.|
43731|How do you handle mistakes?|
43732|What would you do if you've done something wrong?|
43733|#821$#You are joking, right?
#822$#I don't make mistakes.|
43734|#821$# Everything I do is intended.
#822$#If I do anything wrong, it's your fault. I simply don't make mistakes.|
43735|#822$#Are you trying to cover up your own mistakes by pinning them on me?
#821$#Normally, I punish those who make mistakes.
#822$#All I expect from you, though, is an apology.|
43736|#822$#Why do you dare question my decisions?
#821$#It is impossible for me to make mistakes!|
43741|What are your weaknesses?|
43742|What problems do you have?|
43743|#821$#Weaknesses, you say? I'm essentially perfect.
#822$# I don't have any weakness that I can think of.|
43744|#822$#Weaknesses, is it?
#821$#If you find one, let me know, so I can eliminate it straightaway.|
43745|#821$#Problems are for demons less dashing than I.|
43746|#821$#Weaknesses, you say?
#823$#I suppose not having any weaknesses could be considered an issue...|
43751|What's it like in Navea?|
43752|What do you think of Navea?|
43753|#821$#Navea is to be praised for its cultural diversity.
#822$#With such a blend, you'll find things you won't see anywhere else.
#823$#You'll  learn a lot just by conversing with the residents there.|
43754|#821$#Navea is a grand city indeed.
#823$#However, it pales in comparison to where I hail from!|
43755|#821$#Discussing Navea makes me think of the Templars.
#822$#I could lay those shiny suits out with a single punch.
#823$#The fracas could hardly be called a fight!|
43756|#821$#Many masters of combat make their home in Navea.
#822$#You can find them in the west of the city, ready to take on worthy clients.
#823$#Though, between you and me, human Mastery seems but a crude reflection of the mastery spirits possess.|
43761|Let's talk about the different races on Terra.|
43762|What do you know about the different races?|
43763|#821$#I don't care much for Giants and Trolls.
#822$#All brawn, no brain - where's the fun in an opponent like that?|
43764|#821$#The wolfmen are quite insidious.
#822$#What they set themselves to do, they do at any cost. Some might call such behavior...unhinged.|
43765|#821$#I consider the Sarpa a primitive and savage race.
#822$#However, there are some intelligent ones among them.
#821$#They have a delicious sort of feral cleverness - I'm eager to see more of them in the flesh.|
43766|#821$#Dwarves have a very unique sense of style.
#822$#They always wear clothing that covers their faces.
#821$#What have they to hide, it makes me wonder.|
43771|How do you use the Eidolon interface?|
43772|Tell me something about the Eidolon Interface.|
43773|#821$#In the Eidolon interface, you can learn ability information about each Eidolon 
#822$#as well as change the Eidolon's gear or name.
#823$#You better not give me some obscene name!|
43774|#821$#You can read a brief introduction about each Eidolon in the interface.
#823$#I hope you have memorized my own introduction by heart!|
43775|#821$#If you have certain XP crystals,
#822$#you can feed them to your Eidolon in the interface to enhance their ability.
#821$#Don't waste your XP crystals on weaker Eidolons! They are not worthy of such generosity.|
43776|#821$#You can rearrange the members of your Eidolon team in the interface.
#822$#You can't change your team during battles, so select your members carefully.|
43781|How can I improve in dungeons?|
43782|How should I prepare for a raid?|
43783|#821$#The most important thing to do is bring plenty of HP potions.
#822$#If you find yourself in a bind with no other means of being healed, that could prevent you from dying!|
43784|#821$#This is a simple answer:
#822$#You must have as much courage as me.|
43785|#821$#Raiding, correct? Have you fortified your equipment?
#822$#That could make all the difference in an epic battle.|
43786|#821$#What kind of question is this? I am more than sufficient to raid with you.
#822$#No dungeon is too daunting, no enemy too tough for me.
#823$#Just supply me with plenty of XP crystals and I'll get the job done.|
43791|How do you get rare gear?|
43792|Where can I get rare gear?|
43793|#821$#I'm glad you chose me to ask this question to.
#822$#Defeating any rare elite monster will give you a chance to obtain rare gear.|
43794|#821$#I've heard that you can find high-quality gear at the armor shops.
#822$#No, I won't buy any for you.|
43795|#821$#The best way to get great gear is to raid with other players.
#823$#When you get the gear you need, don't forget to thank me for the advice!|
43796|#821$#I'll be more than happy to offer advice.
#822$#Pay attention when you kill monsters; you might see a Valuable Treasure Chest.
#822$#The items in a Valuable Treasure Chest are all superior quality.|
43801|Has anyone ever questioned your character?|
43802|Has anyone ever complained about you?|
43803|#821$#Those people are morons.
#822$#Mortals can never hope to understand me.|
43804|#821$#Are you jealous, perhaps?
#822$#I will forgive you for that. I don't expect anyone to be like me.|
43805|#821$#This isn't backhanded criticism, is it?
#822$#It is a good thing I am so open-minded. I will take this into consideration.|
43806|#821$#Those are just short-sighted views from ignorant people. I couldn't be bothered with it all.|
43811|I've heard that you're the richest being in the world!|
43812|I've heard that the world's wealth belongs to you.|
43813|#821$#You are quite intuitive! I do, indeed, hold all the world's wealth.
#821$#How much that is, exactly, I'd... have to count...|
43814|#821$#Any treasure truly belongs to me.|
43815|#821$#And your point is...? My wealth cannot be coveted.|
43816|#821$#I don't care about other forms of wealth, but the world's treasures are mine.|
43821|Can you fly?|
43822|Are you able to fly?|
43823|#821$#Of course I can fly! There's nothing I can't do.|
43824|#821$#Flying is easy for me.|
43825|#821$#You dare question my abilities?
#821$# It's just flying; I don't understand what the big deal is.|
43826|#821$#There's nothing to flying; why are we even talking about something so trivial?|
43831|How did you get your armor?|
43832|Your armor looks really cool! How did you get it?|
43833|#821$#My armor is my greatest treasure.
#821$#It doesn't matter where it came from.|
43834|#821$#I have so much treasure that I don't even remember where I got this armor from.|
43835|#822$#Oh? You want something like this?
#821$#It's a pity that I don't share my wealth.
#823$#Though, if I do manage to find a second set of armor like this, I could be persuaded to give it to you.|
43836|#821$#Mortals are unfit to use my treasure.|
43841|What do you know about some of the other Eidolons?|
43842|Tell me something interesting about one of the other Eidolons!|
43843|#821$#Talking about the lesser beings is beneath me.|
43844|#821$#The flame that Aelius uses is rather unique because it heals mortals instead of harms them.
#821$#He's so flaky, though. I don't like him much.|
43845|#821$#I recently learned something about Vayu.
#821$# Supposedly, Vayu is the oldest of the Eidolons, over 10,000 years old! I don't know how much merit there is to that rumor.|
43846|#821$#Why even bother with such trivial gossip?
#821$#I'm sure I'm more than interesting enough on my own.|
43851|What made you become the Duke of Darkness?|
43852|How did you become the Duke of Darkness?|
43853|#821$#I was born into that position. I have no other explanation for it.|
43854|#821$#Why even bother asking?
#821$#The answer should be simple. There is no one else more suitable for the title.|
43855|#821$#There is no point in asking.
#821$#That position was made for me.|
43856|#821$#Only those at their prime, powerful above all else, can rule.
#821$#How else would I have become Duke?|
43861|Do you have any friends?|
43862|Is there anybody who wants to be your friend?|
43863|#821$#I used to have a good friend. We ruled Pandemonium together.
#821$#However, I somehow got him into serious trouble...|
43864|#821$#Hah, friends?
#821$#Only one person qualifies to be a friend of mine!|
43865|#821$#Ignorant fools can never understand how to be friends with me.|
43866|#821$#I've only ever had one friend in my life.
#821$#I can't be bothered with anyone else.|
43871|Have you ever experienced failure?|
43872|Have you ever been defeated?|
43873|#821$#I sincerely hope you are not looking down on me.
#821$#How could I ever be defeated?|
43874|#821$#What is this 'failure' you speak of?|
43875|#821$#I've never failed a match, but I have come to a tie with someone once.
#821$#That person became my only friend.|
43876|#821$#What sort of being do you take me for?
#821$#I've never failed in the past, nor will I fail in the future!|
43881|How do you govern Pandemonium?|
43882|What are your methods of rule?|
43883|#821$# This answer should be simple. I make all the decisions, of course.|
43884|#821$#The answer to this question should be obvious.
#821$#I give out orders, those under me follow them. Simple as that.|
43885|#821$# I am the only ruler. No one questions my orders.|
43886|#821$#Ruling Pandemonium is actually quite easy to do.
#821$#In fact, it can be rather boring at times. I'd rather be in a fierce battle with a worthy opponent!|
43891|If you and I were separated...|
43892|What would happen to you if we ever parted ways?|
43893|#821$#To keep myself occupied, I'd simply go in search for the strongest opponent and defeat them.|
43894|#821$# Don't worry about me. I have a kingdom to return to.|
43895|#821$#You... you'd actually consider leaving me!
#821$#How dare you! I forbid it!
#821$#Who put you up to this idea? I'll chew that person up and spit them out!|
43896|#821$#What would you do without me at your side?
#821$#Perhaps you should worry more about what you would do rather than what I would do.|
44001|What would you do if you encountered a powerful enemy?|
44002|How do you handle a strong opponent?|
44003|#822$# I handle them excellently, of course.
#821$# I'm the Champion of the Slain, Sigrun!
|
44004|#822$# Powerful enemies? Hmm...
#821$# If you have the opportunity to wear them down at range, take it.|
44005|#822$# To me, fighting is like breathing. I don't think about how I do it, I just do!|
44006|#821$# I do not consider an enemy's power, just its weakness.
#823$# Concentrate on your enemy's weaknesses, and you will be victorious.|
44011|What do you think of fighting?|
44012|What do you normally fight for?|
44013|#822$# There are many forms of battle, not just on a battlefield!
#821$# A good fight can be found anywhere - on the field or in your heart.|
44014|#823$# I am the Champion of the Slain! I was born to fight.
#822$# I fight to test my heart and my will against all opposition.|
44015|#821$# So long as you take joy in your power and the proving of it, you will never fight an unworthy battle.|
44016|#822$# Pft! What a boring question! 
#821$# Warriors fight, they die... And then they are mine.|
44021|What kind of person do you like?|
44022|What sort of guy would you date?|
44023|#821$# Only the bravest warrior is deserving of the hand of Sigrun, Champion of the Slain!|
44024|#821$# Ugh! Why are we talking about this?
#822$# Wait... you aren't into me, are you?! 
#821$# That's not the kind of relationship we have!|
44025|#822$# Do I look like some trembling maiden to you? 
#821$# I admire strength in battle, defiance in adversity.
#821$# Only one who is truly powerful will attract my attention.|
44026|#821$# This question is strange. What are you really asking?|
44031|What kind of person would be your friend?|
44032|What does friendship mean to you?|
44033|#821$# My only friends are those I trust to have my back in a fight!|
44034|#821$# I have had human friends, but as time passed, each of them died.
#824$# There's just too big of a difference between Humans and Eidolons...|
44035|#821$# A friend is someone who is willing to sacrifice everything for you, even their life!|
44036|#822$# Why do you ask? Don't you have friends?
#821$# Don't look at me like that! You're the one looking for advice. 
#822$# Don't worry, if you don't have other friends, you'll always have me!|
44041|What do you do when you're in a bad mood?|
44042|How do you overcome a bad mood?|
44043|#822$# With battle, of course... Friends will do, if there are no enemies handy! 
#821$# Hahaha, I was just kidding! 
#822$# Hey, why are you suddenly way over there?|
44044|#821$# Why? Are you in a bad mood?
#822$# Tell me what's bothering you. I'll stab it, and things will be better.
#821$# What? Why are you looking at me like that?|
44045|#823$# With glorious combat!
#821$# Bleeding and sweating away your frustrations is the best remedy.|
44046|#821$# What does a mood matter? You do what you have to, when you have to.|
44051|Do you know of any places of interest in Helonia Coast?|
44052|Do you know anything interesting about Helonia Coast?|
44053|#821$# Helonia is a bustling town, with strong commercial activities.
#824$# Despite the town's economic strength, the people are too weak to protect themselves!|
44054|#821$# Helonia Coast often has pirate problems.
#822$# Pirates aren't much to fight, but better than nothing.|
44055|#821$# Silverash Shores got its name from its shimmering white sand. 
#822$# No, the shoreline is not actually covered in ash!|
44056|#821$# I'm sure you've noticed all the different windmills east of Helonia, right?
#822$# I bet you've never counted how many there are!|
44061|What do you think about the Dwarves?|
44062|What do you know about the Dwarves?|
44063|#823$# Dwarves are a perfect example of why to not judge a book by its cover!
#822$# They may be short and funny-looking, but their weapons are second to none!|
44064|#821$# Dwarves are skilled craftsmen. They make the most sophisticated machinery I've ever seen.
#822$# You should see their fighting robots in action!|
44065|#822$# There is a Dwarf tribe at the Cactakara Forest. Visit them if you get the chance.|
44066|#824$# Some people can't tell the difference between Dwarves and Gnomes. In reality, they are like night and day.|
44071|What are the benefits of joining a guild?|
44072|Tell me something about guilds.|
44073|#821$# When you reach level 10, you can create a guild. 
#822$# After all, even the strongest hero needs comrades to back them up!|
44074|#821$# After you meet certain requirements, you can open a shared space, designed exclusively for the guild. 
#822$# You and your guildmates should definitely strive for this!|
44075|#821$# Guild members can be a source of support during your adventures.
#823$# It reminds me of glorious days of battle with my comrades! Eat together, sleep together, fight together!|
44076|#822$# To upgrade the guild's level, just gather Guild Funds by completing certain quests. 
#821$# When you have accumulated sufficient Guild Funds, the Guild's level will automatically upgrade. Simple!|
44081|I wanna know the secrets of Sword and Shield.|
44082|Please teach me skills for wielding a Sword and Shield.|
44083|#821$# You've come to the right person! I'm the Champion of the Slain, proficient with Sword and Shield! 
#822$# As long as you train hard, and follow my instructions, I guarantee that you will make progress.|
44084|#821$# The essence of using Sword and Shield is to switch between offensive and defensive stances swiftly. 
#822$# Try to use the shield in your hands to make all kinds of daring moves!|
44085|#821$# The brave warriors wielding Sword and Shield have a strong ability to control the flow of battle. 
#822$# They can use their shields to protect partners while using the sword to attack enemies.  
#823$# People using Sword and Shield are the most suitable to fight on the front line!|
44086|#821$# As well as attack and defense, the Sword and Shield combo can also impose special statuses on enemies. 
#822$# After certain masteries have been learned, the Sword and Shield combo can even stun all enemies within a certain range.|
44091|Do you know the use of Elemental Symbols?|
44092|Please inform me about Elemental Symbols.|
44093|#821$# Elemental Symbols carry eight different kinds of pure Elemental Energy from the Cube of Gaia. They are very rare. 
#822$# But if you let me connect to Gaia, then getting those Symbols is not impossible.|
44094|#821$# The Elemental Energy in the Symbols can resonate with an Eidolon's own power. 
#822$# So if you give the Symbols to an Eidolon, the Eidolon's strength can be increased.|
44095|#821$# Humph! I'm the Champion of the Slain, Sigrun! 
#823$# Even without the strength of Symbols, I will still be invincible!|
44096|#821$# All Eidolons will need certain kinds of Elemental Symbols for their evolution. 
#822$# If you ever get those Symbols, do not throw them away.|
44101|You are always wearing armor. Don't you feel feel encumbered?|
44102|Your armor looks very heavy!|
44103|#822$# Who do you think I am? 
#821$# I'm Sigrun, Champion of the Slain!
#822$# My armor is no heavier than my skin.|
44104|#821$# This armor is a gift of Gaia! 
#822$# Under no circumstances would I take this armor off!|
44105|#822$# Humph! I'm the Champion of the Slain! 
#824$# Through long training, this armor and I have become one.|
44106|#822$# Maybe it would seem heavy to you, but not me. 
#821$# I'm an immortal Eidolon! Such limits mean nothing to me.|
44111|What are the qualities of a warrior, to your mind?|
44112|What kind of person can be called a warrior?|
44113|#821$# Someone who never backs down, who is not afraid of any difficulties, and shows courage at all times!|
44114|#822$# Why? You want to be known as a warrior?
#821$# As long as you follow me and fight by my side, I'm sure you will become the bravest warrior!|
44115|#821$# Warrior?... Hmm... 
#821$# Well, I have been watching battles since the beginning.
#822$# I know a warrior when I see one!|
44116|#822$# Well, you are in luck! 
#821$# What's a warrior like? Just look at me!|
44121|What do Eidolons do in daily life?|
44122|What do Eidolons usually do?|
44123|#821$# We are beings of spirit. 
#822$# It's hard to describe our lives in terms of beings of flesh...|
44124|#821$# Do? It seems that I don't do anything worth mentioning. 
#822$# All I can recall is a vision of endless battlefields...|
44125|#822$# I watch over battles, and guide slain warriors into the land of the dead.|
44126|#822$# Well... I don't know about the others. 
#821$# As for me... I just keep training, and keep an ear out for new wars!|
44131|Have you always had such long hair?|
44132|Does your hair get in your eyes in battle?|
44133|#821$# I've kept my hair this long for a while, now.
#822$# My helmet keeps it out of the way.|
44134|#821$# Actually, I used to wear my hair very short. I felt like I needed a change.
#824$# Being a spirit, it can be any length I imagine it to be.|
44135|#821$# Is that what's really important to you? It's just hair.
#822$# As long as my helmet keeps it out of the way in a fight, what does it matter?|
44136|#822$# What's wrong with long hair?
#821$# I keep it out of the way, so I don't have to worry about it getting in my face.
#821$# Not to mention, my hair is so beautiful!|
44141|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
44142|Tell me some interesting gossip about the Eidolons.|
44143|#822$# Humph! Yarnaros is a womanizer! 
#821$# But... The speed and agility he shows in battle are worth watching.|
44144|#822$# Aelius's flame is amazing! 
#821$# It's flame, yet it can heal wounds. Isn't that strange?|
44145|#821$# Bel-Chandra's dance of destruction is the most beautiful dance I've ever seen! 
#822$ What's more important is how deadly it is!|
44146|#822$# Kotonoha looks weak, but her strength can never be underestimated. 
#821$# Her unique sorcery can absorb enemies' lives, which is truly scary!|
44151|I heard that you see things with your heart?|
44152|How did you learn to see things with your heart?|
44153|#822$# Not everybody can learn that. It requires purity and strength!|
44154|#822$# Do you want to learn to see things with your heart? 
#824$# The heart sees true, and truth isn't always pretty. Are you sure?|
44155|#822$# How did I learn to see things with my heart? 
#824$# It's different for Eidolons. We are our hearts, more than humans are.|
44156|#822$# If you wanna learn to see things with your heart, first you need to get that rib cage out of the way! 
#821$# Don't worry, I'm just messing with you!|
44161|Is it true that Eidolons can live forever?|
44162|How long can Eidolons live?|
44163|#822$# I don't know. Forever isn't over yet. 
#821$# Once it does, I'll let you know if we live forever.|
44164|#822$# I don't know whether Eidolons really have eternal lives. 
#821$# But even if we fall in battle, we will return.|
44165|#821$# Well... I don't know exactly how long Eidolons live. 
#822$# But I've lived through thousands of battles, so that must mean something.|
44166|#822$# Who wants to live forever? 
#821$# Who dares to love forever?|
44171|I heard that you kiss your chosen warriors?|
44172|Can the chosen warriors get your kiss?|
44173|#821$# I kiss the chosen warriors and lead them into the Aura Kingdom myself!|
44174|#821$# That's right! Do you also want my kiss? 
#822$# You only have die once. I'm sure it's worth it!|
44175|#822$# It's true, my kiss can wake the dead. 
#821$# But first, you have to die...|
44176|#822$# That's correct! But you forgot to mention the most important point. 
#821$# I'll only kiss those warriors who die heroically on the battlefield.|
44181|How good of a cook are you?|
44182|Do you know how to cook?|
44183|#822$# I'm the Champion of the Slain, Sigrun! 
#821$# Cooking is not an important skill to me!|
44184|#822$# Have you ever seen any Eidolon cooking for themselves?|
44185|#822$# What about you? Just look at how skinny you are.
#821$# I bet you can't cook at all!|
44186|#822$# Cooking skill? Don't think of me as some mortal servant! 
#821$# I protect the slain as they go into their afterlives! Cooking doesn't come up often.|
44191|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
44192|What's your plan after we split up?|
44193|#822$# You mean after we separate? 
#821$# Why think beyond the next battle? You may not live past it.
#822$# What matters is to live in the present!|
44194|#822$# I never expected that you would ask me such a question... 
#824$# Have you eaten something bad? Are you sick?|
44195|#822$# What are you asking me this for? Do you wish to be rid of me? 
#821$# Death is the easiest way to separate yourself from me!|
44196|#822$# Why would you think to ask me such a question!? Even if we part ways today... 
#823$# , I'm sure I'll see you, one last time... On your final battlefield.|
44301|What type of person are you into?|
44302|What type of person are you attracted to?|
44303|#824$# Sorry... I've been focusing on other things.|
44304|#824$# I don't know. All are beautiful... But I don't think that's what you meant.|
44305|#821$# Actually, there was someone. But that was a long time ago...|
44306|#821$# I've haven't thought about that kind of thing in a long time...|
44311|What is a friend, as far as you are concerned?|
44312|How do you define friendship, in your heart?|
44313|#821$# Friends are there for each other, In good times and bad. 
#821$# Friends are loyal to each other, and to remain true.|
44314|#821$# Are you telling me that you don't have any friends? 
#822$# Don't be upset. I'll be your friend.|
44315|#822$# The only friend I want to spend my whole life with is Tsubaki...|
44316|#821$# I don't worry about other people's opinions. I know a friend when I see one.|
44321|What do you think it is to be gentle?|
44322|What seems gentle to you?|
44323|#821$# You chose me, and that was gentle.|
44324|#822$# Gentle? I think Tsubaki is gentle...|
44325|#821$# As far as I'm concerned, Tsubaki is a gentle person. 
#822$# I'm lucky to have met you.|
44326|#821$# I don't know what gentle is... Would you like to help me with that?|
44331|If you could have one wish granted, what would it be?|
44332|What's your dearest wish?|
44333|#821$# My wish? That my friends and I can be there for each other our whole lives.|
44334|#821$# I wish that you get your wish.|
44335|#822$# Wish... My wish? 
#821$# I'll tell you the details when the time is right...|
44336|#822$# Wish... What about yours? Do you have a wish you want to come true?|
44341|Tell me about the dream you had, that stays with you the most.|
44342|What is your most memorable dream?|
44343|#821$# In the dream, I'm on a prairie, in the sunset, the beautiful smile on Tsubaki's face. Oh god, her smile was so beautiful...|
44344|#821$# But a dream... Is just an illusion. 
#822$# I think the present is what matters.|
44345|#822$# Indeed to dream is nice, but a dream is out of reach. 
#821$# So make sure you are not obsessed with dreams and ignore reality.|
44346|#821$# I was walking on a long path, and Tsubaki was walking ahead of me. 
#824$# However, no matter how hard I tried to catch up with her, the distance between Tsubaki and I became greater and greater... 
#822$# Luckily... Luckily it was just a dream.|
44351|What's special about Cactakara Forest?|
44352|Could you tell me something about Cactakara Forest?|
44353|#821$# Two waterfalls run through the forest. That's why it's named Cactakara Forest. #823$# I love the beautiful scenery here. #822$#I don't even want to leave everytime I cam here.|
44354|#822$#It is such a vigorous place, with many dwarfs living here. #821$#They have the most amazing craftsmanship.|
44355|#821$#Apart from the dwarfs, there are also strange creatures with ram heads and horse bodies. #822$# They are not inferior to other species in terms of wisdom and strength. #822$# They always keep a distance from other species, but I'm glad that I can be closer to them.|
44356|#823$# The forest is my favorite spot. Its aura calms me down. #821$# I love to go there on my spare time. #822$# If you are stressed, you can come with me. I'm sure you will find inner peace.|
44361|What are those secret altars that appear in odd places?|
44362|I wanna know about the Eidolon Altars.|
44363|#821$# This is the broken entrance of dimensions. #822$# If you can repair it, the spirits of land will be awakened.|
44364|#821$# It requires great power to fix it. #824$# It'd be unwise to try by yourself. #823$# Why don't you go find people with kindred spirits and work on it together?|
44365|#821$# If you worship the Eidolon Power with a devout heart, you probably can repair it soon.|
44366|#822$# The Eidolons who rest here don't want to be disturbed. #824$# If you wake them up, they may be furious. #821$#... Do you insist?|
44371|Please tell me about Eidolon Skills.|
44372|What do you use Eidolon Skills for?|
44373|#821$# This is what I can do to save the world. #822$# I will do all I can, for the sake of the common people.|
44374|#822$# I have my signature skill, which is very powerful,
#821$# if use at the right moment, it is possible to turn the tables. #823$# If you are in great danger, do not hesitate to call me. I will fight by your side.|
44375|#821$# Eidolons created by their mother - Gaia's Cube have their unique characters. #822$# You can choose the one that matches you the most. #824$#¡KEven if it's not me, I wish you all the best with your journey.|
44376|#821$# Eidolon's skills are not limited to causing damage on the target. #822$# Because of their unique characters, they can either heal you or cause greater damage to the enemies. #823$# They can even become your ride or be a part of you and fight with you.|
44381|Please tell me something about Party Search.|
44382|I want information about the Party Search.|
44383|#821$# Party search can speed up the formation of Instance Party.
#822$# If you are looking for like-minded people, the system will fulfil your wishes.|
44384|#821$# The system can help your party reach the destination faster.
#823$# If you know how the system works, it will be very convenient for you and me.|
44385|#822$# Though it helps you teaming up with like-minded people,
#821$# don't forget about the manners.|
44386|#821$# If you are looking for company, you can do it through the system.|
44391|What is the Envoy's Path?|
44392|How should I choose my way on the Envoy's Path?|
44393|#822$# Every three levels you upgrade, you will get one point. #821$# If you use it wisely, you will be stronger.|
44394|#824$# If you reach the bottleneck in your adventure, don't be upset.
#821$# Try to reset the points and you will have a clearer view.|
44395|#821$# Different choices may lead to different outcomes.|
44396|#822$# It may not be wrong to hold onto something, but if you can consider other possibilities,
#821$# you may be more successful.|
44401|Your wings look nice.|
44402|Your wings are so beautiful.|
44403|#822$# Thank you for your compliment. I'm so glad.|
44404|#821$# Tsubaki also likes my wings very much...|
44405|#821$# The Cube of Gaia gave me my beautiful wings. I'm glad you like them.|
44406|#822$# What Tsubaki said is true! Humans do like wings.|
44411|You are very fond of lotus, aren't you?|
44412|You have a preference for the lotus, don't you?|
44413|#822$# The lotus is elegant and gorgeous. I do like them very much.|
44414|#821$# Actually, I have no preference for myself. It's just that Tsubaki likes lotus very much...|
44415|#822$# I enjoy all things that grow from the earth. I like them all.|
44416|#821$# I do like the lotus very much. What about you? Do you also like lotus as much as I do?|
44421|Will your hands fall?|
44422|Have your hands ever fallen?|
44423|#821$# You don't have to worry.|
44424|#821$# My hands will stay on my body until the moment I die.|
44425|#822$# Hee hee... It reminds me that the first time Tsubaki met me, she asked me the exact same question.|
44426|#824$# Where did you get that idea? Have your hands ever fallen off?|
44431|You and Tsubaki know each other very well, don't you?|
44432|You and Tsubaki are very close, aren't you?|
44433|#821$# Tsubaki... Is my first and best friend.|
44434|#821$# Tsubaki... Is my closest friend. 
#822$# I hope our friendship will last 'till the end of our lives...|
44435|#821$# I was once very quiet, so I didn't have too many friends. Tsubaki was my only friend. 
#822$# The fact that I can talk to you like this now? I've got her to thank for that.|
44436|#821$# It might surprise you to know we're very close. I would do anything for Tsubaki.|
44441|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
44442|Tell me something interesting about the Eidolons.|
44443|#824$# I never dig into matters that are none of my business. 
#821$# Of course...most matters are my business.|
44444|#821$# Abraxas is as mighty a warrior as I've ever seen.
#822$# I've heard he's from the Aura Kingdom, but wherever he comes from, he is impressive, yes?|
44445|#821$# Zaahir's whole body radiates an intense heat. Normal people can't even approach him.
#821$# I wonder how he spends time with his Envoy?|
44446|#821$# Tsubaki is an agile ninja, full of acrobatic maneuvers.
#822$# We've been great friends for a long time.|
44451|Can you sit down?|
44452|You are unable to sit down, aren't you?|
44453|#821$# Sit down? I don't need to sit.|
44454|#821$# The moment I fall from the sky is the moment I die.|
44455|#824$# I don't need to care about such trivial matters.|
44456|#821$# You don't have to worry. I have my own way to rest.|
44461|What are the Holy Books?|
44462|Could you tell me about the Holy Books?|
44463|#821$# The Holy Books contain much wisdom - a greater sum than all the libraries of this world.|
44464|#821$# The Holy Books enable me to communicate with all kinds of creatures, and guide their souls to the right path.|
44465|#822$# The Holy Books are the books of wisdom. You can obtain great knowledge from them.|
44466|#822$# I can't explain them to you in detail. The only way to know is to read them yourself.|
44471|You have very unusual skin color. Were you born like this?|
44472|You have very unique skin color. Did you make it that way on purpose?|
44473|#821$# I am as I was formed - no more, no less.|
44474|#822$# The natural look is always best when it comes to appearance. 
#821$# There is no need for me to change.|
44475|#822$# Thank you for your compliment.|
44476|#821$# You're not bad looking, yourself.|
44481|What's the blue ornament on your abdomen?|
44482|What's that on your belly?|
44483|#821$# One day, you'll know.|
44484|#822$# It was given to me by the Cube of Gaia, and I will keep it with me until the day I die.|
44485|#824$# Well... I can't really talk about it. One day you will find the answer yourself.|
44486|#821$# It was a gift from the mother of Eidolons, the Cube of Gaia. 
#821$# All Eidolons born of the Cube of Gaia have this.|
44491|Have you thought about your life after we separate?|
44492|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
44493|#821$# You don't have to worry. I have places to go.|
44494|#821$# I have much to do in this world.|
44495|#821$# Do you want me to go? 
#824$# I think there is much more we have to do together...|
44496|#821$# Our separation now prepares us for our reunion later. 
#822$# You and I will surely meet again.|
44601|What kind of flowers do you appreciate the most?|
44602|What kind of flowers do you like the most?|
44603|#823$# Hee hee. Of course, my favorite is the lily, which symbolizes purity.|
44604|#821$# The fragrant and elegant lily is the most suitable symbol of divine purity. 
#822$# I hope to plant a few, as I travel this world with you.|
44605|#821$# Every flower has its own beauty, as every person has his or her own strength. 
#822$# But my favorite is the lily, for it brings me great calm.|
44606|#821$# The lily is my favorite flower. What about yours?|
44611|Do you know how to cook?|
44612|How are your cooking skills?|
44613|#823$# Actually, I'm pretty confident about my cooking, especially when it comes to desserts. 
#821$# I will make some for you next time, so you can try them.|
44614|#821$# Cooking is one of my hobbies.|
44615|#822$# Though I know how to make all kinds of  food, I'm best at making dessert.|
44616|#821$# Wow, how did you know that I like cooking? 
#823$# Just how much attention are you paying to me?|
44621|What do you think death is?|
44622|What is death to you?|
44623|#822$# Death is one part of the process of reincarnation. It's only a short section of the cycle of life. 
#821$# After the soul is separated from the body, the next chapter of life begins.|
44624|#821$# Death is not the end, only a new beginning.|
44625|#821$# Sometimes death is not a state, but rather a process. 
#824$# Purifying the soul through death. Yes, that was once my duty...|
44626|#822$# To humans in Terra, there are so many unsolvable mysteries about death. That's not the case in other worlds. 
#821$# In other worlds, the concept of death doesn't even exist.|
44631|What's your favorite color?|
44632|What color best symbolizes you?|
44633|#821$# Just look at the clothes I'm wearing. My favorite color is white. What about yours?|
44634|#822$# Pure white is my symbol.|
44635|#823$# Of course my favorite color is white. Watching blooming lilies calms me down.|
44636|#822$# I think of my work in this world as scraping dirt from a white stone. 
#824$# It's a process of removing the impurities and revealing the world's light...|
44641|What do you think peace is?|
44642|What does peace mean to you?|
44643|#821$# Peace is being able to drink and talk with the person you love, with no fear. 
#822$# The faces and hearts of both filled with peace and harmony.|
44644|#822$# Peace is the world filled with laughter and warmth.|
44645|#823$# Each and every battle you and I have fought, we fought to protect peace in the world.|
44646|#822$# Peace was once what I tried my best to protect, but I lost my way... 
#824$# Peace! Peace! Numerous sins have been committed in the name of peace!|
44651|What's special about Cactakara Forest?|
44652|Could you tell me something about Cactakara Forest?|
44653|#823$#Cactakara Forest? The forest is beautiful. 
#821$#A river formed by two waterfalls of different sizes flows through the forest.  
#822$# It's a magical place.|
44654|#822$# In the Cactakara Forest there is a small tribe of dwarves. 
#823$# Ah, that is, the tribe is small. Not the dwarves.
#823$# Well, not any smaller than normal dwarves.|
44655|#821$# A group of Centaurs is living in the ruins in Cactakara Forest. 
#822$# They don't much like outsiders.|
44656|#821$# Cactakara Forest is a quiet place, very restful. 
#822$# It's said that an Eidolon who likes to meditate shows up there on occasion.|
44661|What are those secret altars that appear in odd places?|
44662|I wanna know about the Eidolon Altars.|
44663|#821$# The Eidolon Altars are broken now, but if many people work together, they can be restored. 
#822$# When a portal is opened, one can communicate with the Eidolons on the other side.|
44664|#822$# Though Eidolon Energy for the altar is difficult to collect, it's not impossible.
#823$# I'm sure sufficient quantities can be collected, with help.|
44665|#822$# All we must do is offer the Eidolon Energy to the broken altar, and, gradually, it will be restored.|
44666|#821$# The altars have the power to send telepathic messages from people to Eidolons. 
#822$# Be respectful. The Eidolons will be unhappy about being summoned. 
#823$# They want to make contact with Envoys, but who likes to be woken up by a stranger?|
44671|Please tell me about Eidolon Skills.|
44672|What do you use Eidolon Skills for?|
44673|#821$# With the skill Taunting Eidolon, the Eidolon taunts the enemy, drawing the enemy's attacks.|
44674|#821$# The power of the Ultimate Strikes you and your Eidolon can work together is astonishing. 
#822$# Don't wait, use the Ultimate Strike immediately!|
44675|#821$# Each of us has different origins and strengths, so the skills we have are also different. 
#822$# Carefully picking an Eidolon who complements your own strengths can make your adventure easier.|
44676|#822$# Eidolons can do more than fight. 
#821$# Some can even serve as their Envoy's mount!|
44681|Please tell me something about Party Search.|
44682|I want information about the Party Search.|
44683|#821$# Party Search allows you to recruit party members quickly, to get into a dungeon faster.|
44684|#823$# Using the Party Search System greatly reduces the amount of running around involved in recruiting adventurers. It's very convenient!|
44685|#824$# After forming a party, you must try to get along with the others. They're protecting your back, treat them with respect.|
44686|#822$# When you need to enter a dungeon in Multiplayer Mode, you can look for party members with the Party Search System.|
44691|What is the Envoy's Path?|
44692|How should I choose my way on the Envoy's Path?|
44693|#821$# You will get one Envoy's Path Point every three levels. You must spend it wisely.|
44694|#824$# Don't lose heart if you encounter difficulties when you attack a dungeon; try reallocating your Envoy's Path Points.|
44695|#822$# You can even get new Combination Skills, based on which paths you choose.|
44696|#823$# Choosing different ways on your Envoy's Path will lead to different Skill Points.|
44701|How do you train yourself in unarmed combat?|
44702|Who taught you unarmed combat?|
44703|#821$# To maintain quick reactions, I spend a lot of time reviewing the basics every day. 
#822$# It's been my habit since I started in the martial arts.|
44704|#822$# Though I'd like to answer your question, I can't tell you who taught me. You're safer not knowing.|
44705|#823$# There's nothing particularly worthy of mention. Long story short, hard training. 
#821$# If you want to learn to fight like me, I'm more than happy to  give you some guidance.|
44706|#824$# I've been away from my organization for so long... The only thing that hasn't changed might be my martial arts skills.|
44711|How do you get such a healthy skin color?|
44712|How do you get so tan?|
44713|#823$# Hee hee, this looks pretty natural, doesn't it? 
#821$# I spent a long time living in a sunny place. 
#822$# The tan has stayed with me ever since!|
44714|#822$# I didn't go sunbathing, not on purpose. My skin color comes naturally.|
44715|#822$# I don't think about my skin, beyond basic hygiene. 
#823$# It doesn't really matter.|
44716|#821$# If you get out in the sun more often, you can have a tan of your own, too.|
44721|Do you often recall your past?|
44722|Do you think about the past a lot?|
44723|#824$# My past... That was a dark time in history... 
#824$# Even if the whole world has forgotten, I'll always remember...|
44724|#821$# The past isn't gone; it is just underneath the present. 
#822$# So even if the past has been forgotten, it doesn't mean things never happened... 
#824$# And, no, I haven't forgotten.|
44725|#821$# Of course I think about the past occasionally. Don't we all?|
44726|#823$# Talking about my past dredges up some rather unpalatable memories. Let's change the topic.|
44731|Have you ever faced multiple enemies alone?|
44732|Have you ever been surrounded by enemies before?|
44733|#821$# Of course I have. It's a common thing to be surrounded by enemies in battle. 
#822$# Use terrain to your advantage, and you can separate your enemies and fight them one by one.|
44734|#822$# As long as you can find a way to defeat your enemies one by one, you don't have to worry even if you are surrounded.|
44735|#821$# I once went to Pandemonium, alone, and was surrounded by numerous demons there. 
#823$# But I'm standing right in front you, in one piece, talking and smiling, aren't I?|
44736|#824$# Being surrounded by enemies is nothing, compared to being betrayed by former comrades-in-arms...|
44741|Tell me a little bit about the other Eidolons.|
44742|I want to know the gossip of the Eidolons.|
44743|#824$# Bahadur seems to have a very mysterious past... Maybe you can get some information from him. 
#823$# Ah... On the other hand, don't try. Please just forget about what I said.|
44744|#822$# Tigerius Caesar is suave, and thus very popular among women wherever he goes. 
#823$# But I did hear that he keeps someone very special in his heart, and is a surprisingly nice guy.|
44745|#822$# Heh heh, Gigas is a big automaton, and his burly body often scares kids. 
#823$# At times like these, he never knows what to do. He's actually rather shy, under his bluster.|
44746|#822$# Quelkulan is not only good at healing, he also has profound knowledge in other areas. 
#821$# He's also said to have invested a lot of effort in defending the wilderness.|
44751|Which is your dominant hand?|
44752|Which of your hands is more dextrous?|
44753|#821$# My dominant hand is my right hand, though I wouldn't say I like my right hand better.|
44754|#822$# In battles and in daily life, I use my right hand more often.|
44755|#823$# If the right hand represents benevolence, the left hand represents justice. Which hand do you think better of?|
44756|#824$# As a whole, I'm more like the left hand. The left hand represents necessary evil.|
44761|Why do you look sad sometimes?|
44762|Is there something on your mind?|
44763|#821$# Really? Do I look too serious? 
#823$# I was thinking. That's my thinking face.|
44764|#822$# No, I'm ok, but thanks for asking.|
44765|#821$# If I told you I was once an assassin, would you believe it? 
#823$# Wow, the look on your face. Like I expected, you don't believe it, do you?|
44766|#824$# The way I did it... Can't be wrong...|
44771|Where do you get your clothes?|
44772|Does your outfit have a special meaning?|
44773|#821$# This is my battle suit; I have been wearing it for a long time. It fits me well, doesn't it?|
44774|#822$# There's a very special circle pattern on my skirt. Can you guess what that is? 
#823$# I'll give you a hint. This pattern has something to do with my origin.|
44775|#821$# This outfit suits me, doesn't it? 
#823$# It helped me a lot when I was working... in the past. But let's not delve too much into that...|
44776|#824$# If I keep wearing this outfit, I'm afraid that sooner or later, I'll be found by some...less-than noble past connections.|
44781|Do you have important partners?|
44782|Do you have trusted friends?|
44783|#821$# Of course I do. All people who are willing to trust me are my partners.|
44784|#821$# Establishing such a deep friendship is not easy, especially when it requires complete trust in others. 
#822$# But in order to protect the world, I'm willing to trust wholeheartedly.|
44785|#823$# Now, you're my most important partner!|
44786|#824$# I had a close friend, but something happened between us... 
#823$# Ah, I'm sorry, I shouldn't bother you with old news. Let's not talk about my past.|
44791|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what would you do next?|
44792|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what plans do you have after that?|
44793|#821$# Even if the parting day finally comes, I'm still willing to be there for you. 
#822$# Whenever you call my name, holding lilies, I'll come to you immediately.|
44794|#822$# If such a day truly comes, I guess that would be fate, you can't fight it. 
#824$# And I will give you my best wishes and leave you with a smile...|
44795|#822$# Even if we part one day, I'll never forget these days of our adventure together. 
#824$# I also hope that you can think of our time, when you see blooming white lilies on the roadside.|
44796|#824$# I believe that even if one day we disagree with each other, you still wouldn't betray me... Right?|
44901|Do you gravitate toward a certain kind of person?|
44902|What do you look for in a companion?|
44903|#822$#Not speaking too much. Doing what I say! Those are the basic requirements!|
44904|#821$#Always staying loyal to me, through thick and thin!|
44905|#824$#I especially admire people who have strong desires and aspirations. Those are the people who usually become successful later.|
44906|#824$#What kind of question is that? Are you trying to butter me up?
#821$#Impossible, no, no, no, next question!|
44911|Have you ever had any interesting dreams?|
44912|Unforgettable dreams?|
44913|#821$#Something that sticks out in your memory... Yes, in fact. I do have one I can share that's quite special.
#823$#I once dreamed that I was visited by a little impish night demon that showed up uninvited and tried to steal my socks.
#824$#Haha! How dare he try to disturb me!|
44914|#821$#Is everything okay? Why are you suddenly asking me about dreams? Did you have a nightmare?
#824$#A nightmare? Only weaklings have those. Maybe you should take a look at yourself first before you start commenting on others.
#822$#...What? What? What did you want, my pity?|
44915|#822$#Dreams aren't real... You must have too much free time if this is what you're worrying about.
#824$#I would have thought you were busy enough as it is.|
44916|#821$#Do you like dreaming? Personally, It doesn't interest me. I prefer to be awake.|
44921|What are your thoughts on revenge?|
44922|What is revenge to you?|
44923|#822$#Revenge is a beautiful thing. An eye for an eye, as they say! But sometimes, you just gotta take both eyes, you know?
#821$#But of course, revenge is a dangerous path to tread. Sometimes it blinds you and you later realize you were at fault in the first place.
#824$#Even I am guilty of this at times!|
44924|#821$#Uh... Are you okay? Why are you asking about revenge? Did someone bully you?
#821$#Hey! Tell me who bullied you. I'll clobber 'em!|
44925|#821$#The word "revenge" may seem passive, since it's always a reaction.
#821$#Me, I rarely take offense unless someone has really gone out of their way to offend me... But when I do, you'd better watch out!|
44926|#821$#Revenge? Oh yes. I'm what some would call an expert in it.
#821$#But don't worry, only those who have truly earned my wrath will taste it.|
44931|What do you think it means to be powerful?|
44932|Where does true power really come from?|
44933|#824$#Haha, you're cute. Looking for a quick tip on gaining power? Try learning a little subtlety.
#821$#Listen, you want power? As long as you take good care of me, I can give you everything. Energy, power, money... I got it all.|
44934|#824$#I'd say that revenge is the world's most irreversible power.
#821$#Rage can release a power that transcends all normal ability.
#822$#That's why it never pays to make enemies. You never know who's going to come looking for payback.|
44935|#821$#Learning from failure forces you to grow up. Learning to exact revenge can make you stronger. This is the essence of true power.|
44936|#821$#Hahaha! A yearning for power is a fool's desire. The more you search it, the further it recedes.|
44941|Is there any type of person that you really don't like?|
44942|Which characteristics really annoy you?|
44943|#821$#I detest cunning and pompous people.
#824$#You can always tell that such a person would quickly betray you.
#822$#I try to keep those sorts of people as far away as possible.|
44944|#821$#Dishonest people are the worst... You make a promise, and then you break it... What can you even say about a person like that? Disgraceful.
#824$#Lie to me, you're gonna regret it. You'll be in for a big, tasty plate of pain and suffering.|
44945|#821$#I hate people who keep secrets. I feel sick just thinking about it.|
44946|#821$#I don't like the Eidolon that you were talking to.
#824$#But I think I can trust you... You wouldn't betray me. Would you?|
44951|Can you tell me anything about Port Morton?|
44952|What is Candetonn Hill like?|
44953|#821$#Huh? How should I know? Shouldn't you be the one telling me?|
44954|#822$#i have no idea. What is this? Some kind of homework assignment you don't want to do?
#823$#Hahaha! I don't think it's something you can just have described to you. You really have to visit yourself.|
44955|#821$#The New World... I've heard it's full of unexplored territory and unknown creatures!
#823$#We should go see for ourselves! I'd be happy to accompany you.|
44956|#822$#I've heard that there are some powerful creatures living there...
#823$#Of course, nothing that would pose a threat to someone with my talents!|
44961|Do you have any idea about how the world started?|
44962|I heard something about this 'Cube of Gaia' thing...?|
44963|#823$#Haha! You're getting into pretty deep subject matter there, buddy. I usually don't bother about that sort of thing,
#822$#You should ask one of the older guys like Vayu or Alucard!|
44964|#821$#Yeah I've heard that the world was created by the Cube of Gaia...
#824$#I don't get what's so special about it. It's just a cube. I wouldn't believe everything you hear.|
44965|#821$#The Cube of Gaia was already there before I was born.
#822$#How did it come about, why, for what purpose... Nobody knows...
#823$#But I don't suppose you really need to worry about that just yet... You've got a long way to go before you become a philosopher.|
44966|#824$#Um... is this a pop quiz? I didn't realize this was something I needed to know...|
44971|Do you know anything about rare elite monsters?|
44972|I was wondering if you had any advice on taking them down.|
44973|#824$#What? You don't even know that? I thought you were supposed to be smart. I guess I was wrong.
#821$#It's just a monster that's a bit bigger than the others. That's why it's called elite. Man, you really are ignorant, aren't you. Shocking! The standard of education really is falling.|
44974|#823$#Why, it's the strongest out of all the monsters!
#821$#Even monsters that look similar have their differences. Some are just stronger.
#824$#One thing's for sure though, nobody's gonna be calling you an elite any time soon, haha! Sorry if the truth hurts.|
44975|#823$#Haha! Again with the questions! Which monster can be considered elite? Not you, that's for sure. Haha!|
44976|#824$#Don't let the description scare you. It's nothing we couldn't deal with.
#822$#But for your average local, these elite monsters are kind of a handful.
#821$#Why don't we go check one out when we have time?|
44981|What's the Eidolon Combo Skill?|
44982|How does it work?|
44983|#823$#Haha. Can't help you there, sorry. You just have to train your body...
#822$#Check it out, I'll give you some power and give you a taste of the Combo Skill!|
44984|#821$#Sorry, no idea! It's too complicated to explain.
#824$#Why don't you try asking that little girl Astraea!|
44985|#822$#Sorry, that's privileged information that I only give out on a
#821$#need to know basis. I don't think you're ready to handle it just yet.
#823$#Haha! Maybe you should hit the gym before you come asking about such things...|
44986|#822$#Why are you asking so many questions? Why not just give it a try and see what happens? What a scaredy cat.|
44991|I'd like to know about the Login Reward System.|
44992|What's special about Login Rewards?|
44993|#821$#Hmm? Login Rewards? What, you mean you were gonna log out? You're just gonna leave me here all alone?|
44994|#821$#Just stay logged in and you can get some nice treasure.
#824$#Oh, yeah I've heard about that. For some reason, you can do it, but I can't. It's not fair!|
44995|#824$#What? You don't even know that? Not the sharpest tool in the shed, are we? You're kidding, right?|
44996|#821$#What do you need a reward for? The reward is spending some time with ME!|
45001|What do you think about traitors?|
45002|What should I do if someone betrays me?|
45003|#824$#Betrayal... That's not something you need to worry about with me!
#822$#What are you insinuating? That kind of question doesn't even merit a response! It's very insulting!|
45004|#822$#Depends on what the person means to me... If it's you, for instance, it's no big deal since you're just a stupid muppet anyway.
#821$#Haha!!
#824$#You know what they say... Dead finks don't talk.|
45005|#821$#If someone betrays me, they better know they're in for a world of pain.
#824$#I don't take that kind of thing lightly. Believe that. The last time someone betrayed me, they spent the next six months sipping their food through a straw.|
45006|#823$#Betrayal? Haha... hahahahaha!! If anyone had a plan to hurt me they would have done so long ago.|
45011|What about you?|
45012|Who were you planning on betraying?|
45013|#822$#What kind of question is that?|
45014|#822$#You need to think before you start opening your mouth. What's with you, anyway?
#823$#You're lucky that I'm in a good mood today. I'll tell you.
#821$#I've been betrayed by more than a few in my day, but they all regretted it later. That I can guarantee.|
45015|#821$#Hahaha! Yes, there were a few. I've got a list of names, and let me tell you, you don't want your name on that list.
#822$#Don't mess with me.
#824$#What, are you gonna betray me?|
45016|#821$#How insulting!
#824$#Do I look like I hold grudges?|
45021|Is it true that you revolted once?|
45022|Because of the relationship between Astraea and Aelius?|
45023|#821$#Ah! Those were the days, when those two and I thought nobody could defeat us...
#822$#Things always seem so rosy, looking back.
#823$#Perhaps one day, I'll remember you fondly as well. Not holding my breath though. Tee hee! Just joking!|
45024|#824$#What I've done... Or what type of relationships I've been in... That's none of your business, all right?|
45025|#824$#What? That's rather personal, don't you think?|
45026|#821$#About that... Was it the right call or not?
#822$#I don't really think about things that way. What's done is done. I regret nothing!|
45031|I've heard that you have kept lots of pets, no?|
45032|Do you like pets?|
45033|#821$#Pets? You mean these little monsters?
#823$#Haha! You're really cute, talking about those.|
45034|#821$#I don't own pets, but many of my servants are interested in pets...
#824$#Wait... Are you asking me that because you want to be my pet?|
45035|#824$#I think you misunderstood a few things about my little assassin team...|
45036|#822$#Pets? Hmph! Pass... That's not a very interesting topic.|
45041|Can you tell me any Eidolon gossip?|
45042|I'd love to hear some juicy stories about Eidolons.|
45043|#824$#You're a weirdo, you know that? You never ask anything about me, yet you want to know Eidolon gossip?
#822$#You need to learn a thing or two about manners.|
45044|#821$#Legend has it that Uriel used to have white wings, but they turned black because of all the killing...
#823$#That's pretty cool, actually.
#822$#But I don't have much other gossip to tell you. I'd rather concentrate on what we're doing. It's more interesting than random gossip, don't you think?|
45045|#821$#Well, Diao Chan's rather greedy. A bit like me, probably!
#824$#Hmph! But she's too darn pretty. I'll just have to do something to disfigure her beautiful face. Then nobody will compare us anymore.|
45046|#821$#Did you know that Hansel and Gretel aren't actually biologically related?
#823$#Haha! Oh, that was mean. I should take it back. I'm probably just saying that because I'm jealous that they have such a close relationship.|
45051|Do you hate me?|
45052|I have a feeling that you don't quite like me.|
45053|#822$#Don't you go guessing what my thoughts are.|
45054|#821$#Hatred? I couldn't hate you, I'd have to actually care about you first. Haha!|
45055|#821$#Oh, you humans are so cute with your insecurities. Go on, keep guessing. What am I thinking now?|
45056|#821$#What is it? Did I upset you?
#824$#Wow, you really do take offense easily. You're kind of a baby, aren't you? Are you gonna cry? Go on then, cry. Aww, look at the poor baby.|
45061|I heard about this incident with a golden apple...|
45062|Do you know anything about it?|
45063|#822$#Oh yes, I do. I know it's evil! I was once captivated by it,
#824$#but thinking back on it now, I was a fool to get taken in!|
45064|#821$#The golden apple... It wasn't just an apple, it's a horrible, cursed thing.
#824$#Even today I can remember it.|
45065|#822$#Golden Apple? Did you say golden apple? Can you get one for me?
#824$#You can't? Ugh, then don't bring it up around me...|
45066|#821$#Dredging up the past again, are we? It was a long time ago, okay? I'd rather not talk about it.|
45071|So, do you have anyone you're interested in?|
45072|Any Eidolon crush I should know about?|
45073|#822$#Other Eidolon? Don't you ever mind your own business?
#824$#Oh lord... Please don't tell me you're one of those weirdos who goes in for Human on Eidolon relationships are you? Ewwww.|
45074|#821$#Well, I can tell you one thing. I've never liked Alucard. He's such a dweeb!
#823$#Haha! That said, when he turns into a dragon he sure is a cutie.
#824$#I must say I was pretty surprised by that!|
45075|#824$#Excuse me? Just whom do you think you are that you can ask me about that?|
45076|#823$#Well. There's only one person I'm really interested in at the minute. But I'm not saying who!|
45081|Wow, those wings are so special!|
45082|They're beautiful!|
45083|#823$#Um, yeah. Okay, thanks for the creepy compliment. What do you want, some sort of reward?|
45084|#821$#Okay, thanks...? Why are you telling me that? Did you do something bad?
#822$#Oh! Now I can't stop being suspicious of you...
#824$#I guess for now I'll just have to believe that you're just admiring my wings.|
45085|#821$#Oh, really? You like them? What do you like better, pure white wings, or my Sanguine Wings?
#823$#Oooh! My, thank you! What a nice compliment. You're a charmer, aren't you!
#822$#Or... do you say that to everyone?|
45086|#821$#Haha, what kind of line is that? Do you try it on all the Eidolon?|
45091|What do you plan to do once our adventures together come to an end?|
45092|What would you do if we separated?|
45093|#822$#What? Are you trying to get away from me? Don't let the door hit you on the way out!
#824$#If we're going to travel together, you'd do well to understand that it's only because I let you tag along, mmkay?|
45094|#821$#Good question. You should prepare yourself mentally for such a situation.|
45095|#824$#It may well come to pass one day. If it does, I shall go and look for Kronos to buy you some time.
#821$#Listen, kid. Let's face it. Humans are a race with limits. If I have to lose you one day, it'll be my own fault for choosing a weak one. And that's something I'll just have to deal with.|
45096|#821$#Why are you thinking so negatively?
#823$#C'mon, buck up! We're not gonna get separated! We're a great team! I'll always protect you.|
45201|What are your thoughts on art?|
45202|What do you think of the laws of aesthetics?|
45203|#821$#Uh, why are you bringing this up now?
#822$#Trying to feel a bit classier, are you?|
45204|#821$#I'm not really interested in that kind of thing, honestly.
#822$#You sure do ask a lot of strange questions, don't you? Are you trying to impress me?|
45205|#821$#Art can be something that people feel so closely, it's almost like it's a part of their body.
#822$#Well, I think you have nice eyes. And maybe one day, I'll take one of them if you don't stop with all the questions, capiche?
#821$#... Oh come on, I was only kidding! Did you really think I was serious?|
45206|#821$#That's a rather broad question. There are many forms of art... The art of cursing, the art of rejuvenation...
#822$#What's that? Oh, you're not feeling well?
#821$#No worries, we can change the subject.|
45211|Do you have a favorite animal?|
45212|What do you think about animals in general?|
45213|#821$#Animals are lame and stupid.
#822$#I don't even like talking about them.|
45214|#824$#Animals? Yeah, they're fine... I don't pay much attention to them.
#821$#But vultures seem to follow me around for some reason.|
45215|#821$#Dude, again with the questions? How about if instead of talking about brainless animals, you go train for once?
#821$Don't try and act like you don't need it, because we both know you are in terrible shape.|
45216|#821$#You humans keep animals that you like as pets.
#822$#Kinda like how I keep you as MY little pet!
#824$#What? Humans are too animals! Don't be silly. That's no fun.|
45221|Any pet peeves?|
45222|What do you hate the most?|
45223|#823$#I really don't like it when people touch my wings.
#821$#Unless it's one of my kids. Then it's okay.|
45224|#821$#My pet peeve is seeing anyone try to hurt you.
#822$#That makes me so angry, I want to kill!|
45225|#823$#Thievery is a terrible act.
#822$#It really disgusts me and gets my dander up when people try to take what isn't theirs.|
45226|#821$#Arrogance and boastfulness
#822$#are really unattractive qualities, I feel.|
45231|Do you have any amazing stories to tell?|
45232|What's the most amazing experience you've ever had?|
45233|#821$#Humans are some of the most single-minded creatures I've seen.
#822$#Once they start something, they hate to give it up, even if it's a futile quest.
#824$#This determination is really something to admire.|
45234|#821$#If you ever save someone's life, there's this strange sense of calm that sets in. What's wrong? What are you cowering over there for?
#822$#You think my experiences are too awful to hear about?
#824$#You need to learn some strength, kid. The world can be an unforgiving place.|
45235|#821$#Have you ever tried to track down someone who was lost, even after it seemed hopeless?
#824$#There was this person who I finally managed to find after nearly giving up.
#821$#That brief moment of joy is something I won't quickly forget.|
45236|#822$#You're the only person I'd ever want to track down, you lovely rascal, you!
#821$#I never would have expected that I'd have such a close relationship with a human.|
45241|How would you handle an encounter with a powerful enemy?|
45242|What's the best strategy for dealing with a powerful enemy?|
45243|#821$#Look for your enemy's weakness, then exploit that weakness. Be ruthless if you need to.
#822$#This is a valuable experience for me. Can't wait to put it all to good use on the battlefield! Got it?|
45244|#822$#Haha, enemies? What enemies? Why are you acting so scared?|
45245|#822$#Don't you know you have nothing to fear?
#821$#With me at your side, nobody's going to hurt you!|
45246|#822$#You should get back to training instead of worrying about things like that.|
45251|Have you ever been to Port Morton?|
45252|What is Port Morton like?|
45253|#821$#I've heard it's a very large port, full of all sorts of people who are involved in the trade business.
#824$#We should go check it out!|
45254|#821$#Do all ports built by humans look the same? Ships, merchants, cities, and so forth.
#823$#What? You just want to know how the seafood is there, don't you?
#821$#Me, I don't like seafood too much. It's so smelly. If you want to find out, you should just take a trip there on your own sometime.|
45255|#821$#What am I, a tour guide?
#822$#Why don't you just go there and find out?|
45256|#821$#I'm sure someone there would be happy to talk to you. You want to know how it compares to Port Skandia?
#824$#They're not really comparable... One is a fishing port and the other one is a trading port. Anyway, I have no time to answer such a trivial question!
#821$#If you're really interested, why don't you go find on your own?|
45261|What's the Sky Tower like?|
45262|Can you tell me anything about the Sky Tower?|
45263|#821$#You mean the tower that is so tall it touches the sky?
#822$#Well, it's supposed to be chock full of marvelous treasure-- the kind that enhances your powers.|
45264|#822$#I thought everyone knew that.
#821$#You must be the only person in Terra who didn't know!|
45265|#821$#There are many mysteries surrounding the tower,
#824$#some of which even I have not been able to solve...
#822$#Together, I'm sure we can get to the bottom of them! Whaddaya say?|
45266|#822$#You simpleton! Don't you even know that?
#824$#You know, sometimes I really worry about you. Were you dropped on your head or what?|
45271|Can you tell me anything regarding the creation legend?|
45272|I'm interested in the Cube of Gaia.|
45273|#821$#Well, the Cube of Gaia has legendary power.
#824$#But I don't know how it's activated, if it needs to connect with a creature or if it's just an energy cluster.
#821$#If you find out, let me know.|
45274|#822$#You don't know that either?
#824$#I guess you've got a lot to learn. Okay, listen up.|
45275|#821$#It's often said that the Cube of Gaia is what created the world.
#824$#As for why it wanted to create the world, I am not sure, and honestly, I'm not really interested.|
45276|#821$#What? So you want to know about the Cube of Gaia, do you?
#822$#I'd forget about it, if I were you.
#824$#That sort of power isn't something that you can control.|
45281|Have you heard of Rafiq's Court?|
45282|What can you tell me about Rafiq's Court?|
45283|#821$#It's an ancient ruins site out in the Star Sand Desert.
#822$#It's full of the kinds of old junk that you humans consider to be valuable treasure.|
45284|#821$#I bet you didn't know there's also a hidden vault at the ruin site!
#822$#There is much treasure inside. Perhaps some intrepid adventurer is already there searching for it...
#821$#Wait, where are you running off to? Don't tell me you're trying to get there first! I wasn't even done talking!|
45285|#821$#The ruins site is vast. Until recently it used to be very quiet.
#823$#But recently there's been a bunch of Goblins running around. It really makes me nervous!
#821$#If you see any, please help me squash them!|
45286|#821$#The human exploration teams were always so noisy. They loved using strange weapons, too.
#823$They were so haphazard, they didn't even do a sweep of the area before entering the site, that's what caused the machine to go out of control.
#824$It was so noisy that even I got irritated, and I'm usually very patient.|
45291|Can you tell me anything about the Aura Kingdom?|
45292|What's the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
45293|#821$#It's some kind of event where you can test your knowledge.
#821$#If you ace the test,
#822$#I guess I'll have to stop making fun of you for being a dummy.|
45294|#821$#Rather than me explaining it, you should just take part in the contest.
#822$#Just do me a favor and try not to embarrass me.|
45295|#821$#It's just a question-and-answer event where you can get rewards. Why not give it a shot?
#821$#Just try not to embarrass yourself.
#822$#You don't want the word to spread that you're a fool, do you?|
45296|#821$#You've been asking so much, why don't you just try it?
#822$#I don't like people who are indecisive.|
45301|I've heard that you are pretty good with curses...|
45302|Can you give me a lesson?|
45303|#821$#You've heard right! I'm the cursemaster. The spell caster.
#821$#The Valedictorian Maledictorian.
 #821$#When I practice my Voodoo, it's too true, you're in the doodoo, crying boohoo. My rap game's on point too.|
45304|#821$#Curses can be very effective against powerful enemies.
#822$#It feels so good to look upon their agony as they suffer.
#823$#It just makes me feel so warm and tingly inside. I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you... For real though.|
45305|#822$#It's not that easy to curse someone... First need to collect their saliva.
#823$#Gross, isn't it?
#822$#It wouldn't be hard to get some of YOUR saliva though, since you drool all the time.|
45306|#822$#Do you really want me to demonstrate?
#821$#How about we put a curse on Tanith, that haughty woman?
#821$#Haha! This is gonna be great! I've been waiting so long to do this. Don't worry, I promise you she deserves what's coming to her.|
45311|I've heard that having your friendship is like a blessing from the gods.|
45312|People say that having you on their side is like a guarantee of victory!|
45313|#821$# What? Where did you hear that? Yes, people used to say that about me a long time ago.|
45314|#821$#Yes, I can bestow great power upon those whom I favor.
#821$#But I cannot teach them to use it. That knowledge can only come from within. And often, it doesn't come at all.|
45315|#822$#Sure, I could make you a king.
#824$#All we need is to find some abandoned desert island to call your kingdom.
#821$#But, don't you have anything better to do? Or did you forget about all that?|
45316|#821$#It's just a ceremony,
#822$#but being a king isn't an easy task.|
45321|I've heard that you can resurrect the dead...|
45322|Is it true?|
45323|#821$#Haha! That's just hearsay. Don't believe everything you hear, kiddo.
#822$#Nothing can resurrect the dead.|
45324|#822$#I have the power to direct a soul into a new body after it's passed... Isn't that resurrection?
#821$#... Call it what you like. Resurrection, reincarnation...
#822$#I can't control what words you humans use, can I?|
45325|#821$#I have helped to revive people on a few special occasions...
#822$#But, it comes at a heavy price...
#824$#The entire process is so painful that I don't even like thinking about it.|
45326|#823$#Please don't ask me about it again!
#821$#Don't worry, as long I am here to protect you, that's one thing you don't need to worry about.|
45331|Do you know what Helheim is?|
45332|What do you think about Helheim?|
45333|#821$#Wouldn't that little girl Hel be better able answer that question?
#821$#... actually, maybe not. Listening to her rambling explanation would probably only confuse you even more.|
45334|#821$#If required, I would go to Helheim to guide the lost souls.
#821$#Looking at some of these lost souls,
#822$#I sometimes really wish I could make them whole and beautiful again.|
45335|#821$#A stark and quiet place, filled with dark spirits and the smell of cold air.
#821$#It's rather foreboding, but it does calm me down.
#822$#I don't know why... I suppose it is because there is no sign of life?|
45336|#821$#Making travel plans, are you?
#822$#I can take you there, but I can't guarantee that you'll come back... You don't want to visit? Oh, what a pity...
#821$#I was hoping to show you some of the bloody--- hey! Why are you covering your ears? Did I scare you again?|
45341|I want to hear some juicy Eidolon gossip.|
45342|What do you think about the rest of the Eidolon?|
45343|#822$#Don't you feel like Tanith is super snobbish?
#821$#I find her simply unbearable. She was probably deprived of attention as a kid.|
45344|#824$#Amaterasu is really smart, but she's kinda antisocial.
#821$#... have you asked Amaterasu if she has a sword you could use?
#822$#Should I care about that question?|
45345|#822$#Tsubaki and Nalani have a complicated relationship.
#822$#Oftentimes, the rivalry between two females overrides their friendship,
#821$#But there's no animosity at all between those two. It's nice to see.|
45346|#821$#I've always respected Cleopawtra.
#822$#She's just got such a natural strength and winning mentality.
#821$#She's a great role model!|
45351|I heard that when you cry, your tears are like a flowing river!|
45352|Is that really true?|
45353|#824$#Hey, hey hey! Cool your jets. I don't talk to just anyone about my private life.|
45354|#821$#A long time ago, I met someone who looked just like you.
#824$#But in the end I couldn't protect them... The only thing I could do was to fix their shattered body.
#821$#I put the broken pieces back together, crying all the while... by the time I looked up, I realized that I had cried a whole river.|
45355|#822$#I have feelings, you know.
#821$#It's normal to cry about sad things, isn't it?|
45356|#821$#One day, if you get that close to someone, maybe you'll understand how I feel.
#824$#My heart breaks when I imagine bidding you farewell...
#821$#I don't wanna talk about it, alright?|
45361|Do you like children?|
45362|Are you good with kids?|
45363|#824$#Kids are such a pain to deal with. They may look cute, but taking care of them is another story entirely.
#821$#You mean, have I ever taken care of any children before? Yes, of course.
#821$#Many people love raise kids and watch them grow up happily, but why?|
45364|#821$#I only like children who are cute but also know how to be quiet.
#822$#I used to take care of this one child. He was usually pretty good, maybe just a bit naughty...
#821$# You must know I'm talking about a child, not a pet. Pets can be naughty too!|
45365|#821$#Are you asking about kids like Hansel and Gretel, or more like Serena?
#822$#Well first of all, Serena isn't a real kid.
#821$#Just looks that way.|
45366|#822$#Um, that's a bit personal, don't you think? Don't you feel ashamed asking me that?
#821$#What do you mean? You want to have my kids?
#822$#Haha! The look on your face! Man, you're easy to fool.|
45371|I heard that you used to take care of Anubis?|
45372|Is that right?|
45373|#821$#Huh? How did you know that?
#821$#I didn't really take care of him.
#822$#He basically takes care of himself.|
45374|#822$#I let him stay at my place for a while. After all, I was asked by an important person if I'd take him in. I couldn't very well say no!
#821$#But I'd give him food whenever I could remember to, and he's looking pretty good now.
#824$#He was usually very obedient, but he ran away after seeing me sewing. Rather odd...|
45375|#824$#There were some unavoidable circumstances,
#821$#and I was asked if I could take him in for a while.
#822$#He was so small back then, and he looked so cute when he was gnawing on bones!|
45376|#821$#I did spend some time with him. He was very young then...
#823$#No! I'm not his mother! Who told you that?
#823$#Someone's been passing you false information! You really should stop gossiping so much! Do you understand me?|
45381|I heard you are good at needlework?|
45382|Are you any good at sewing?|
45383|#821$#Of course. I love sewing all kinds of things in my spare time.
#822$# I just love sewing. Herringbone, back stitch, satin stitch, embroidery, darning, the works! I could go on- have you ever tried unicorn thread? It holds so well. Hey, are you still listening?
#821$#Hey, where are you going? I was talking! I'm not a fool, you know.|
45384|#821$#Sewing isn't exactly difficult, all you need is a needle and thread. Hey, where are you going?
#821$#So you want me to do your repair work, huh? Too cheap to bring it to a real craftsman?
#823$#Jeez, some people! Why don't you try fixing it yourself!|
45385|#821$#I'm okay at fixing stuff, but I don't know about sewing new clothes from scratch.
#822$#I've stitched a few wounds shut in my day. Human, animal... Ooh, and I've helped preserve some ancient mummies as well!
#821$#Stitching them back together was quite the trial!|
45386|#822$#You want some lessons, do you?
#821$#I can teach you, but you'll need to focus! No halfhearted attempts!|
45391|If there comes a day where we have to part ways...|
45392|How would you cope?|
45393|#823$#What's with you, anyway?|
45394|#824$#You're gonna make me sad!
#822$#Are you thinking of leaving me?
#821$#Maybe I'll make a voodoo doll of you so I can always have you near me.|
45395|#821$#Wow, awkward question! Uh, let's talk about it another time?|
45396|#821$#Don't worry, I'm never gonna give up on our team! Even if you get shattered into a million pieces, I'll find a way to fix you!
#824$#No matter how long it might take... I would stitch you back together, piece by piece...
#821$#What, am I creeping you out? You me you wouldn't do the same for me?|
45501|Are there any types of people you think well of?|
45502|If you were to date, what would be your criteria?|
45503|#821$#Obedience is a necessary quality in a good subject.
#823$#But to those who obey, my hand can be surprisingly gentle.|
45504|#821$#I think well of those who put my needs before their own.
#822$#That said, one who does not cultivate and consider their own opinions would not be a partner worthy of me.|
45505|#823$#I would find it most capricious to find a partner skilled in dance, that we might perform complex steps together.|
45506|#823$#Know your place. When I feel like telling you, I will.|
45511|What's your favorite beverage?|
45512|What is your favorite thing to drink?|
45513|#821$#I enjoy bitter and spicy drinks; drinks with pungent aromas.
#824$#Sweet drinks do nothing for me.|
45514|#823$#An envenomed wine goes down easily. My lips tingle with every sip.|
45515|#822$#When I tire of beverages, I sometimes eat live arachnids.
#823$#There's a tickle, then a crunch, then a smooth center. Simply delicious.|
45516|#821$#It seems all my favorites are too poisonous for humans.
#824$#Alas, it's unfortunate that your kind are so fragile.|
45521|What do you do in your free time?|
45522|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
45523|#824$#What a imbecilic question. Have you taken no heed of my rank?|
45524|#821$At times, I climb high into the mountains and meditate to strengthen my powers.
#823$I want the thunder I call down to be able to ravage entire countries - worlds, even!|
45525|#823$#Think about it - I wasn't born such a graceful dancer.
#822$#The control and form I've achieved has required much training.|
45526|#823$#I seek out weaklings and etch into them an understanding of how pitiful they are.|
45531|Do you have a dream?|
45532|Tell me about your goals for the future.|
45533|#823$#Need you even ask? I wish for all to bow before the peerless beauty of my dance.|
45534|#822$#I aim to become the finest dancer in this world or any other.|
45535|#824$#My stark grace is a gift
#823$#that should be seen by the whole world. Don't you agree?|
45536|#821$#As a dominator of worlds, I shall need someone to manage my obligatory fan club.
#823$#Without a doubt, you are best-suited for the position.
#8232#You must proselytize others and win them over to me without fail. I trust you will tackle this endeavor with your customary gusto.|
45541|What should I do when I face strong enemies?|
45542|How do I deal with powerful enemies?|
45543|#823$#Strong enemies? Even the mightiest men and beasts crumble under the torment of my heavenly thunder!|
45544|#822$#When I meet a foe who dares to defy me, I take great pains to ensure they suffer for it.
#823$#As their body writhes in pain, they will have just enough awareness to realize the mistake they have made.|
45545|#821$#For those enemies who actually merit some manner of respect, I will dance my dance of destruction before them.
#823$#As my body shifts and gyrates, we will lay armies low before us.|
45546|#824$#My dance is a peerless wonder. If we are not victorious, the fault must lie with you.|
45551|What's special about the Oblitus Wood?|
45552|Could you tell me something about the Oblitus Wood?|
45553|#821$#Once, the Oblitus Woods were a beautiful forest where those who wished to forget their troubles would go.
#822$#Look now at how it has fallen to ruin - spider webs everywhere, miasma in the air...
#824$#It sounds like a delightful place to visit.|
45554|#822$#I have heard that the Varan have established a presence in these woods.
#823$#Shall we amuse ourselves by pulling the tails off of those lizards?|
45555|#824$#Just hearing the name "Oblitus Wood" bores me. Let us speak of other things.|
45556|#821$#It's said that a mournful wind shrieks and moans from around Ghostsweep Cave in the Oblitus Wood.
#823$#Perhaps such sounds would be the perfect accompaniment to my dance!|
45561|What do you think of Terra?|
45562|Tell me what you think of your time in Terra.|
45563|#822$#Sadly, Terra is an inferior plane to Pandemonium, or even the Aura Kingdom, because the march of time means that all will eventually decay.
#823$#However...I suppose there's a certain beauty in that sense of transience.|
45564|#821$#The land you inhabit is not all that exists in Terra.
#821$# Across the sea is another continent, even larger than this.|
45565|#822$#What is Terra to me? A trifling world, fragile as glass.
#823$Were I to dance with the fullness of my fury, I could obliterate this world.|
45566|#821$#After I win the undying love of all Terra with my dances,
#823$#I will use this realm as a base from which to achieve renown in all worlds.|
45571|What's the function of the Community System?|
45572|I'd like a few tips on the Community System.|
45573|#823$#Community System? I have no need of friends.
#822$#Perhaps such a system would be of use to you, though. Yes...go and make new friends, and tell the worthy among them to join with me.|
45574|#824$#It is unfortunate to see you fight alone. I know my company is all one might desire, but...
#822$#Banding together with others is a part of your human nature, is it not?|
45575|#822$#If you ask me, I think you chatter with your friends too much, when your attention ought to be focused on me.|
45576|#821$#It appears one can get "loyalty points" by greeting friends who are present.
#824$#Why am I mentioning this, you ask? Think for a moment.
#823$#If you accrue these points, you can trade them in for gifts befitting of my splendor and beauty.|
45581|I want information about Secret Stones.|
45582|Tell me the lore of the Secret Stones.|
45583|#821$#Secret Stone can stimulate one's latent potential, enabling their strength to surpass natural limits.
#822$#Perhaps they would be an asset to you, if you intend to overcome the handicap of your humanity.|
45584|#824$#Must you really ask me such a trifling question?
#822$#There are merchants in every town and province that can answer your mundane inquiries.|
45585|#822$#If a Secret Stone is upgraded, you can no longer trade it. Consider yourself forewarned.|
45586|#822$#You may reap a substantial harvest of XP from Energy Secret Stones, so do not cast them away like a fool.|
45591|Do you know any secrets regarding Elemental Symbols?|
45592|Please tell me more about Elemental Symbols.|
45593|#822$#Eidolons can increase their strength by consuming Elemental Symbols, so be sure to give all you find to me.|
45594|#823$#These crystals, each inscribed with a symbol for one of the eight elements, contain extraordinary power - for those who know how to extract that power.|
45595|#822$#Eidolon spirits may sometimes receive Elemental Symbols by connecting with Gaia, but the process sounds too tedious for my liking.|
45596|#822$#Elemental Symbols are an important catalyst for Eidolon evolution. For my sake, you must endeavor to gather many.|
45601|Tell me more about your cool third eye.|
45602|What's the secret of your third eye?|
45603|#821$#When I open my third eye, destruction and torment flow from me like a mighty river, so I usually keep it closed.
#823$#Woe is surely upon the one against whom I open that eye!|
45604|#822$#My third eye is the focal point of my power. Even in Pandemonium, its destructive potential is feared.|
45605|#822$#When I open my third eye, I can call down mighty thunder from the sky, racking enemies with pain.
#823$#Be glad that I wink with it at others, and not at you.|
45606|#823$#It is impossible for a mortal to stand against the power of my third eye. Those who tried did not live to regret their foolishness.|
45611|Tell me about your giant fists.|
45612|Let's talk about how cool your punches are.|
45613|#821$#My body alone grants insufficient leverage to destroy enemies with my fists, so I guide them with telekinetic power.|
45614|#822$#My arms are able to hold manipulate the thunder from my third eye, allowing me even more variety in my attacks.|
45615|#822$#These giant fists can attack from any angle, and as I dance, my speed and power flows smoothly into every attack.
#823$#It is through constant motion that attack becomes defense, and defense shifts effortlessly to offense.|
45616|#822$#Are you questioning the subtle beauty of my attacks?
#1001$#Perhaps we should hold a sparring match. I sense you would quickly understand through experience.|
45621|Can you tell me about that fabric fluttering behind you?|
45622|What's that blue fabric that trails behind you?|
45623|#821$#It is just an accessory. I find its beauty enhances my own.
#823$#You must have your eye on me, to have noticed it¡K|
45624|#822$#Not -everything- about me is mystical. The cloth is just an accessory.|
45625|#821$#Beautiful, is it not? I hand-selected the bolt of cloth myself.
#823$#When I dance, every piece must serve to accentuate my graceful movements.|
45626|#824$#As a first-class dancer, it's only natural to have a favorite accessory, like silks or ribbons. It adds to the exotic appeal.|
45631|How did you come to dress like that?|
45632|Let's talk about your unique fashion sense.|
45633|#823$#My armor is made of an alloy found only in the realm of spirits. It cannot be compared to Terra's menial metals.|
45634|#821$#My armor has been tempered with defensive runes that blunt the force of magical attacks used against me.
#823$#But of course, it also looks excellent on me. Form AND function, dear.|
45635|#822$#I designed my shoes myself - no others held up to the rigors of my dancing.
#823$#A stable balance and a sure grip are an asset, whether in dance or in battle.|
45636|#824$Red and black have been a fetching fashion combination since the ancient days. Surely you're aware of that.|
45641|I want to know secrets about other Eidolons.|
45642|Can you tell me something interesting about other Eidolons?|
45643|#822$#I saw Aelius gazing up at a full moon with an expression full of sadness. 
#821$#The look of loneliness writ upon his visage was...surprising.
#824$#I almost did not think him capable of melancholy.|
45644|#822$#I have heard of a trickster sorceress named Kotonoha who is able to use strange magic to quickly restore one's life.
#823$#I do not yet understand the workings of her art, but I can appreciate its skill.|
45645|#821$#It is said that Yarnaros can fly faster than the west wind. Impressive for one with such a hulking form.
#823$#I wonder...if his unstoppable flight clashed with my thunder, which would prove stronger?|
45646|#821$#Sigrun's sword has been blessed over time by the souls she has ferried to the worlds beyond, making it able to cut even spirits.
#824$#You know what else is sharp? Her catty tongue. Scarce do I witness her equal in arrogance.
#823$#If I must contend with her haughty airs any longer, it will come to blows between us.|
45651|Why are you so passionate about dancing?|
45652|What's the reason you stick to the dancer's path?|
45653|#821$#Interacting with normal people bores me, honestly.
#823$#However, even the lowliest clod can recognize an amazing dance when they see it.|
45654|#822$#The art of movement is within my spirit, and dance is an outgrowth of that, equal parts beauty and battle.|
45655|#821$#As one dances, the rhythm of the body
#822$#is like a pendulum that swings in time with the pulse of the world.
#823$#If you understand an entity's life pulse, you also know how to destroy them utterly.|
45656|#822$#Dance is one of those things you can only appreciate by experiencing it with your own body. Perhaps...someday, I will teach you a few steps.|
45661|Tell me some tips for looking fabulous like you.|
45662|What's your secret to having such a toned body?|
45663|#822$#Regular exercise is the key. Even kings grow weak if they make the throne their nest.
#824$#By the look of things, you could stand to lay off the cake yourself...|
45664|#822$#Oh? Do you finally wish to have a perfect body like mine?
#823$#Dance with me, then! If you embrace my ways, one day you may have a body as desirable.|
45665|#823$#Your request is sincere, but I am unsure whether your human body is prepared for a Pandemonian weight management plan.|
45666|#822$#Being a spirit has its benefits, like not getting fat from this realm's food.
#823$#If the world were to end, I might lament the loss of your chocolate confections.|
45671|What's the reason you cover your eyes?|
45672|Why do you keep your eyes covered up?|
45673|#821$#Covering my eyes helps me block out distractions and concentrate.
#823$#In doing so, the power released by my third eye is capable of causing even greater torment.|
45674|#821$#I I were to unveil my eyes, my beauty would drive the world's women to inconsolable tears, fraught at their own appearance.
#824$#Tsk...such a simple answer; you ought to have known that.|
45675|#821$#My beauty has a way of catching wayward eyes, so I block others' gaze from meeting mine.
#824$#Thus, whatever I do, I can do with my full attention. 'Dance like no one is watching', as your culture's saying goes.|
45676|#822$#My gyrations are enough to send any audience into a frenzy. Letting them catch sight of my eyes would inflame their desires beyond what I wish.|
45681|Why is your skin is blue?|
45682|How'd you come to have blue skin?|
45683|#821$#Darling, it's all the venom I drink!
#822$#A glass of venom a day keeps the angels away! Why not try some yourself?|
45684|#822$#Are you interested in acquiring my unique complexion? Maybe if you add more spiders to your diet...|
45685|#822$#Long ago, I had a dusky shade of skin. But my diet in Pandemonium turned my skin this color, and now I can't picture myself any other way.|
45686|#822$#Well, in nature, colors like this serve both to attract a mate, and to signal the danger of a poisonous creature.|
45691|If we ended our pact, what would you do next?|
45692|If we had to say goodbye, what's in the cards for you after?|
45693|#824$#If the day came when we had to part, I would send you off with an unforgettable dance of farewell.|
45694|#821$#Even if you cease to be my most loyal fan, I will continue to dance. I will continue to battle, and I will continue to torment those who stand against me. That is my way.|
45695|#822$#You're not all that useful, but as humans go, you're one of the most interesting I've encountered.
#822$#If we were to part ways, it would likely take me a great deal of time to find someone else as amusing.|
45696|#822$#I would hope that long after we parted, my image would remain burned into your memories.
#823$#Perhaps then one day, it will be I who summons YOU.|
45801|What kind of weather do you like?|
45802|How do you feel about the weather?|
45803|#821$#I enjoy humidity. Gathering clouds and rain in the sky is my duty.
#822$#Naturally,  I favor overcast days, as well as a healthy downpour.|
45804|#822$#Sunny days always bring back so many memories. 
#822$#I have an old friend who loves to travel, but only on a sunny day. 
#824$#It's been a long time since we've fought together, side by side...|
45805|#822$#The weather doesn't affect my feelings overly much.|
45806|#822$#Ever-changing weather is simple one of the laws of nature.
#821$#I gladly accept all kinds of weather.|
45811|Do you have any tips for getting along with people?|
45812|Do you have any advice on how to get along with others?|
45813|#822$#Uh... Does that mean you don't have many friends? 
#821$#Don't be upset. It's their loss if they don't appreciate you. 
#822$#Besides, the way I see it, a small group of true friends is best.|
45814|#822$#Well... I've lived alone for ages, and I haven't talked to others like me for a very long time...
#824$#I'm afraid I don't know how to answer your question.|
45815|#822$#Well... I don't know too much about it either. 
#821$#But the way I see it, tolerance and patience is key.|
45816|#823$#Are you kidding me?
#821$#You are the only one I talk to every day. Have you ever seen me talking to others?|
45821|Does anything offend you?|
45822|What would make you angry?|
45823|#822$#For a man my age, there aren't many things I haven't experienced. 
#821$#Very few things anger me, but I do have one thing that I won't tolerate. 
#823$#I have a tender scale under my jaw. I'll kill anyone who touches it!|
45824|#821$# Heh. I had a short temper when I was young. The slightest thing would make me angry. 
#822$#Now that I'm old, I don't often have the energy to pay that kind of thing any mind.|
45825|#822$#Why do you mention this all of a sudden? 
#821$# Could it be that you've offended someone? 
#822$#If that's the case, I think you'd better go apologize. It's best to avoid any chance of future problems.|
45826|#822$#Heh, in my eyes, you are still but a child.
#821$#When a child makes mistakes, I don't think adults should be too hard on them.|
45831|What are your opinions on death?|
45832|What is death to you?|
45833|#822$#All creatures grow and wither. To me, death is just a new beginning.|
45834|#821$# I've lived for so many years, I don't think there's anything I haven't experienced.
#822$#If my death were to come in the next second, I will face it calmly.|
45835|#821$#You are still very young and are living the dangerous life of an Envoy. You will certainly witness a lot of death. 
#822$#Creatures in the world live and die, and bring life from death. Everything is cyclic. 
#821$#Try to keep your cool about it and enjoy life to the fullest.|
45836|#821$#Heh. You are still so young! Don't waste your life worrying about these things.
#822$#I'm the one who should give it some serious thought.|
45841|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
45842|How do you like to kill time?|
45843|#822$#Sometimes I take a nap, but not for more than a couple of decades.
#821$#By the time I wake, everything has changed!
#824$#The speed with which Terra changes leaves me with confused feelings...|
45844|#821$#I used to go visit my friends when the mood took me...
#822$#However, the last time I've seen them was centuries ago...|
45845|#821$#I don't have any hobbies, actually. How about you? 
#822$#Maybe we can do something together?|
45846|#821$#When I was young, I argued with others a lot. All it took was one wrong word and I'd get violent!
#822$#Thinking about that now, heh, I was really ignorant then... 
#822$Nowadays, I've embraced calmness and serenity. Why cause any more trouble if there's a peaceful solution?|
45851|What's special about the Triatio Highlands?|
45852|Could you tell me something about the Triatio Highlands?|
45853|#821$#The Triatio Highlands are a barren plateau. There's dust everywhere, and it's difficult for plants to grow.
#822$#All the birds, beasts and tribal people that live there are extremely ferocious!|
45854|#822$#Hmm... The Humans and Giants in Triatio Highlands have feuded for a long time.
#824$#In my opinion... It's impossible to avoid conflict when feeding your family is at stake.|
45855|#822$#Avians have lived here for generations, worshiping the Demon God Argus. They have fallen into darkness.
#821$#If you need to deal with the Avians, be very careful.|
45856|#821$#About the Triatio Highlands... Well, there's one thing that keeps bugging me. 
#822$#There are the remains of gigantic, mythical beasts everywhere, but no one has ever actually seen one alive. 
#824$#Could it be that all those mythical beasts have vanished and are hiding away in mountains and oceans?|
45861|Do you know how the world was created?|
45862|Can you tell me about the beginning of the world?|
45863|#821$#Oh, I don't want to patronize you...
#822$#When the sky formed, well, where did the earth come from? These kinds of questions are a mystery to me...
#823$#You remind me of a young child when you ask such questions.|
45864|#821$#The Cube of Gaia is divine; the Cube of Gaia is god!
#822$#That's the first lesson of creation written in our historical texts. Can you truly comprehend its meaning?|
45865|#821$#I heard that the Cube of Gaia didn't exist in Terra at first - it came from outer space!
#822$#After Terra's creation, the Cube of Gaia fell from the cosmos, no longer having the energy to keep itself up.
#821$#49 days later, the Cube of Gaia finally entered the world. Other than that, its origin is a complete mystery...|
45866|#821$#As the saying goes: "There are people beyond this person and skies beyond this sky." There are probably other heavens and other earths aside from ours.
#824$#I think you are clever enough to comprehend this idea.|
45871|I'd like to know about titles.|
45872|What are titles for?|
45873|#821$#Hmm? Does the fact that you are asking this mean that you are seeking fame and fortune?|
45874|#821$#You obtain Titles after you complete certain quests or defeat certain monsters.
#822$#They are great proof to your heroic quests!|
45875|#822$#Well, as far as I know, different Titles can enhance different abilities.
#823$#The effects of the Titlesvary wildly, so the more you collect, the better!|
45876|#822$#Rare Titles can be very hard to get, but offer excellent benefits. Don't give up hope!|
45881|I wanna know about costumes.|
45882|What's so important about costumes?|
45883|#821$#Well, I don't really know much about such things, so I can't really offer any advice...|
45884|#821$#I've heard a human saying: "Clothes make the man." Looking good gets you noticed and makes a statement!
#824$#Though, at the same time... There is such a thing as taking that too far...|
45885|#821$#Costumes must be fun; a dragon such as I doesn't know much about that though...
#823$#If you're curious, how about you talk about it with your friends? You'd be pleasantly surprised.|
45886|#821$#Well, I know there are five different categories of costumes; there are so many options with each type.
#824$#I am so amazed by the diversity you humans come up with...|
45891|Tell me about Eidolon Teams.|
45892|What are the benefits of forming Eidolon Teams?|
45893|#821$#The Eidolon Team is composed of your most loyal Eidolons. They are at your service and will fight for you.
#822$#Do remember that you cannot switch out team members during a battle, so plan wisely!|
45894|#822$#Heh, like the ancient saying goes - Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster.
#823$#As long as you've formed your team to strike at your enemy's weakness, you'll be invincible!|
45895|#821$#You are brimming with talent and potential. Sooner or later you'll be famous and a favorite among all the world's Eidolons.
#824$#The thing is, when that day comes... I hope you won't forget me and all the time we spent together!|
45896|#821$#You can have a maximum of three Eidolons in your team. Frankly, with how difficult your quests are, I'm not sure it's enough!
#823$#Fortunately, you have excellent skills... Heh, I'm sure you will be fine.|
45901|You seem to have lived a very long time. Is this true?|
45902|Could you tell me your age?|
45903|#824$#Well... I'm sorry, but I can't give you an answer. 
#822$#It's not like I don't want to, it's just that I... Well, I don't know! Hah!|
45904|#822$#The King of the Triceragons is a 500-year-old dragon, but I'm sure I've lived longer...
#821$#Maybe you can guess how old I am?|
45905|#822$#Heh. You are truly curious! 
#821$#Why not make a guess?
#822$#Isn't it more fun if you were to find the answer for yourself?|
45906|#822$#The strength of Dragons is proportional to their age. The older we are, the stronger we become. 
#821$#So why don't you make a guess? Based on my strength, how old do you think I am? Pretty old, I suspect! Heh heh...|
45911|Do you have any relatives?|
45912|Do you have any siblings?|
45913|#821$#Ever since I could remember, I have always been alone. 
#822$#So... I'm really not sure if I have any actual relatives...|
45914|#822$#Dragons accept each other as one large family.
#821$#So, in a way, all Dragons are my relatives.|
45915|#821$#Hrm... Let's forget about me for a moment. How about you?
#822$#Do you have any siblings?|
45916|#822$#As far as I can recall, I don't have any siblings.
#821$#But I consider all Dragons to be my relatives!|
45921|Western Dragons are a lot like you. Do you share any similarities?|
45922|What's the connection between you and Western Dragons?|
45923|#822$#I'm not sure if there is a connection,
#821$#but I certainly hope not!
#824$#I can't bear the fact that they obsess over shiny things and gold so much....|
45924|#824$#Western Dragons... I just don't understand how they think.
#821$#Supposedly, they rest on a heap of gold coins!
#822$#That kind of greed astounds me...|
45925|#822$#I've wondered the same thing myself.
#821$#Perhaps Western Dragons are descendents of my kind... Hmmm|
45926|#822$#I... I have no idea. I hope you forgive me for providing no answer for you.|
45931|How do you take care of your scales?|
45932|Your scales are so beautiful! How do you take care of them?|
45933|#822$#Heh, kind of you to ask! I wash my scales every day with clean water to keep their luster.|
45934|#821$#You don't have any scales on your body, do you? Are you just curious?|
45935|#822$#Well... Nothing too special, actually.
#822$#I just make sure to wash them every day, that's all!|
45936|#822$#I've had centuries of learning how to take good care of my scales.
#821$#Even my diet contributes to their wonderful luster.|
45941|I wanna know some secrets about other Eidolons.|
45942|Tell me something interesting about Eidolons.|
45943|#822$#What? I am not the sort to talk about others behind their backs, so please don't ask again.|
45944|#821$#Yarnaros and I are both Dragons, but we have very different specialties.
#822$#Yarnaros is good at offense, while I excel at defense.|
45945|#822$#Sigrun is indeed worthy of the name "Champion of the Slain." She is brave as well as graceful.
#824$#She reminds me of an old friend...|
45946|#822$#Aelius's flame is quite unique as it can heal wounds.
#821$#I've never heard of a flame restoring life before - it's quite impressive.|
45951|Can I pluck your scales?|
45952|Would you give me one of your scales?|
45953|#822$#Uh, no. Definitely not!
#821$#My scales are linked to my strength. Without them, I won't be able to protect you anymore.|
45954|#821$#Am I not by your side every day?
#822$#If you want to see my scales, just look at me. Why would you need to collect them?|
45955|#821$#It's not that I can't give you one, I just don't understand why you would want them.
#822$#I've already sworn myself to be by your side. What more do you need of me?|
45956|#821$#A shed scale loses its luster and begins to crack, which is very unsightly.
#822$#But, if you insist... Sigh...|
45961|Is the legend "Carp Leaping Over Dragon's Gate" real?|
45962|Can a carp really transform to a dragon?|
45963|#822$#Heh. That's just people talking nonsense and creating inspirational tales.
#824$#If it's that easy to become a dragon, how come dragons are so rare?|
45964|#822$#That is ridiculously impossible.
#821$#Just because a carp can leap over the Dragon's Gate doesn't make it a dragon.
#822$#The strongest carp in the world is still just a carp.|
45965|#822$#Hmm, you are ever the curious one.
#821$#How about you journey to the Dragon's Gate and see for yourself?
#822$#As they say, "Seeing is believing". I'm sure it would be more convincing than whatever I say.|
45966|#821$#Well... I have heard the tales before, of course...
#822$#Having said that, I've never met a dragon that was once a carp.
#821$#So I guess "Carp Leaping Over Dragon's Gate" is just a tale for humans to strive for greatness.|
45971|What's your relationship with the Dragon Emperor?|
45972|You and the Dragon Emperor seem to be pretty close.|
45973|#822$#Heh. The Dragon Emperor and I used to go to battle together, so of course we become fast friends!
#821$#We fought in wars that raged across many realms - those were chaotic times!|
45974|#822$#The Dragon Emperor and I are indeed very close.
#821$#Back then... Cough! Hrm... It's better if you don't know about it.|
45975|#821$#Huh? Why do you mention the Dragon Emperor all of a sudden?
#822$# Ah... My guess would be that you heard that the Emperor has lent me his power.
#824$#Sigh... I miss those days when he and I fought side by side.|
45976|#822$#It's not that easy to explain the relationship between the Dragon Emperor and me.
#821$#Perhaps it is a tale I'll tell at a later time...|
45981|Can all dragons fly?|
45982|Is there a kind of dragon that can't fly?|
45983|#822$#I've never heard of a dragon that can't fly.
#821$#I suppose, however, that such a creature is not beyond the realm of possibility...|
45984|#821$#Dragons fly as fish can swim, as beasts can walk; it is in our nature.
#822$#Perhaps there are dragons that can't fly very well, but to be unable to fly entirely? I think not.|
45985|#822$#Haha, this is a joke, yes?
#821$#How is it possible for a dragon that doesn't fly to exist?|
45986|#822$#Are you saying that you've actually met a dragon that cannot fly?
#821$#Now I'm curious; could you please introduce me to this creature?|
45991|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
45992|What's your plan if we ever get separated?|
45993|#822$#Isn't it too soon to talk about parting ways?
#821$#You are still very young.  Living in the present should be most important to you.|
45994|#822$#Union begets separation, this is a rule of life.
#821$#Meeting you made me very happy; but if our parting day comes, I will solemnly accept that, as well.|
45995|#821$#You are an excellent Envoy of Gaia.
#822$#So even without me by your side, I believe you will still achieve greatness!|
45996|#822$#After our parting? Hmm...
#822$#Perhaps I will go visit old friends I haven't seen in quite some time.|
46101|Let's talk about feelings.|
46102|What are your thoughts on anger?|
46103|#823$#Emotions are like tides, they go either up or down.
#821$#Like the surge of an ocean, you should release your anger every once in a while.
#822$#If you let your anger build up inside you, it'll become too much to handle one day and you might go out of control.|
46104|#823$#Heh, you're in an interesting mood today!
#822$#Let us discuss the mysteries of emotion together.|
46105|#821$#As long as there is light, there will be shadow. It is the same with moods.
#823$#Anger is a negative mood and is the most easy to manipulate.
#822$#Hah, I hope you're not getting too bored with my musings.|
46106|#821$#...
#824$#Sorry about that, my friend. When it comes to thinking about anger, I just can't help thinking of a certain someone...|
46111|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
46112|What do you do in your spare time?|
46113|#821$#Oh, I actually do not require much leisure or rest, so don't worry about me.
#823$#No matter the case, providing you the best care imaginable is my most important duty.|
46114|#822$#I enjoy reading novels in my spare time. It's excellent to feel immersed into a world of imagination, don't you think?|
46115|#823$#When my service to you is not needed, I enjoy wandering alone through the deep sea currents.
#822$#I enjoy to calmly listen to the symphony of the ocean's currents - it is truly beautiful.|
46116|#822$#Hmm, sometimes I just like to be still when I want to relax.
#823$#How do you like to relax, when you can spare the time?|
46121|What do you think about etiquette?|
46122|What is etiquette, to you?|
46123|#821$#Civility costs nothing, you need it to deal with people.
#824$#If courtesy disappears, people's souls will also shrivel.|
46124|#822$#Ah, courtesy is the basis to becoming a well respected individual in society.
#823$#I believe that, if you follow my guidance, you will perform outstandingly well!|
46125|#823$#You should always be courteous and respectful, not only for others, but for yourself.
#822$#Only people who know how to respect everyone can face the world with a positive outlook.|
46126|#822$#Ah, I do believe you are already an excellent Envoy of Gaia.
#823$#If you were to somehow surpass your current level of etiquette, you will shine even brighter.|
46131|How do you keep yourself healthy?|
46132|Tell me the secret to maintaining good health.|
46133|#821$#If you want a healthy and strong body, I'd recommend swimming when you can spare the time.
#823$#I find water sports to be a spiritual activity where you can easily release stress and strengthen the muscles.|
46134|#822$#Oh, don't worry too much about your health as long as you have me around!
#821$#Just follow my guidance and you'll be happy and healthy for years to come!|
46135|#822$#Ah, about that... I have heard that some believe that the state of one's mind can affect the body.
#823$#Perhaps, if you want to be healthy, you should start with spiritual exercises.|
46136|#821$#A balanced diet is one good way to keep healthy.
#822$#Taking up cooking is a good way to try new things and keep yourself in good health.|
46141|What do you look for in a person?|
46142|What qualities do you find attractive?|
46143|#824$#Erm, is this line of conversation appropriate to have? I wonder...|
46144|#823$#Hm, what's got you wondering about such a question?
#822$#Heh, perhaps you would enjoy trying to guess?|
46145|#821$#Well, since you asked nicely, I'll level with you.
#823$#I'm honestly not concerned with such base feelings as love and attraction.
#822$#My only goals are to be honorable and well respected.|
46146|#822$#Ha... I'm flattered that you care about me so much. 
#823$#People who care about their team mates, like you do, are probably the best kind of people in the world.|
46151|What's special about the Whirlpool Abyss?|
46152|Can you tell me about the Whirlpool Abyss?|
46153|#821$# Ha... Actually, most of the time I enjoy sleeping in this oceanic trench surrounded by high-pressure water and whirlpools
#822$#The Whirlpool Abyss is the only entrance to that area.|
46154|#821$#Ah, I have many disciples who journey to the Whirlpool Abyss in hopes of meeting me.
#821$#Mortals must pass the test before they can finally meet with me, however.|
46155|#822$#The entrance to the Whirlpool Abyss is within a lake that has a giant whirlpool.
#823$#Only those who dare to jump into the whirlpool can eventually make it to the Abyss.|
46156|#823$#I've heard that there is another place out there that is very similar to the Whirlpool Abyss.
#821$#I'd like to pay it a visit, if I can only find the time.|
46161|What are some special sightseeing spots on the Helonia Coast?|
46162|Can you tell me something interesting about Helonia?|
46163|#821$#Aside from being excellent with business management, the residents of Helonia are all pro anglers.
#821$#They are especially proficient at catching tuna, the fish for people who love a challenge.|
46164|#822$#Folks living along Helonia Coast flourish from the bounty of the sea and hold it in high regard.
#823$#Their love for the sea is why I reside in that nearby whirlpool - I am drawn to their love for the mighty waters.|
46165|#821$#One of the most popular attractions of Helonia Coast is Windwhisper Meadow.
#822$#Whenever a gentle breeze blows across the plains, the imagine of a great ocean appears in my mind. It's beautiful!|
46166|#821$#There's a notorious cave that lies in the north of Helonia Coast. I've heard tales of horrendous monsters dwelling there.
#822$#Do be careful if your path leads you to that cave...|
46171|Tell me something about Adventurer Medals.|
46172|Do you have any information about Adventurer Medals?|
46173|#821$#Adventurer Medals are proof of a hard working Envoy of Gaia!
#822$#If you continue to rack up points from these medals, it'll reflect well on your character sheet.|
46174|#823$#I hear that if you can manage to obtain the highest level of Adventurer Medals you can get extremely rare rewards!
#822$#I'll give you my full support when you decide to take on these tasks, for sure!|
46175|#822$#To obtain Adventurer Medals you'll have to work hard on a wide variety of achievements.
#821$#If you want to try to collect them all, it'll take a lot of work in many different fields of expertise!|
46176|#821$#There are two different types of Adventurer Medals: the easier regular Medals and then the Grand Achievements.
#823$#If you keep completing the achievements to get the regular Medals, eventually you'll work your way up to a Grand Achievement as well!|
46181|What can you tell me about swimming?|
46182|I wanna know more about swimming!|
46183|#822$#Ah, the joys of swimming! It is a great activity for strengthening the body and the mind.
#823$#You can cultivate a strong physique while taking in the beautiful scenery. It's a great way to relax.|
46184|#821$#There are a few hidden locations that can only be found by swimming to them.
#822$#If you have some time, you should try to find those hidden places on your map.
#823$#Doubtlessly it'll be a great experience to discover something new!|
46185|#822$#Oh? Do you have an interest in swimming?
#821$#Stick with my strict training regimen and you'll be a pro swimmer in no time!|
46186|#822$#My best swimming tip is to properly regulate your breathing in a precise rhythm.
#823$#Once you establish a set rhythm and stick to it while you swim,
#821$#you'll be able to efficiently use all your strength to the max!|
46191|Do you have any dungeon tips?|
46192|Let's discuss dungeon strategies.|
46193|#822$#You must be sure to prepare all your equipment and potions before tackling a dungeon.
#821$#I find that it is absolutely necessary to be prepared for any kind of situation and react swiftly.|
46194|#823$#Before you even set foot in a dungeon you should do some research about the bosses you will encounter.
#822$#Once you have pinpointed their weaknesses, you'll be able to clear your way through the dungeon in no time flat!|
46195|#823$#When facing powerful enemies, it is important to equip gear with the correct kind of resistance.
#821$#When you seem to be incapable of defeating your enemies, check your gear and make the necessary upgrades.|
46196|#821$#Bringing along potent potions created through alchemy will momentarily increase your strength substantially.
#822$#If you use these items in battle, you'll be a definite credit to the team.|
46201|Do you have any siblings?|
46202|Can you tell me something interesting about your family?|
46203|#821$#How kind of you to ask after my family! I do have two family members, but I haven't seen them in a long time...|
46204|#821$#My eldest brother is rather cranky, yet he is an extremely brave warrior of high status.
#822$#When he is angered, I've heard that he can destroy any mountain he comes across...|
46205|#822$#Ah, now that you mention it... I haven't talked much about my family, have I?
#823$#If we ever have a chance, I'd love to introduce you to my youngest sister.|
46206|#823$#Hmm, I, too, am interested in knowing more about your family.
#821$#Let's take some time to get to know each other better, shall we?|
46211|Why are you always smiling?|
46212|How do you manage to always be in such a good mood?|
46213|#823$# Ha... I'm a professional! I'm always supposed to have a smile on my face.|
46214|#822$#My best tip for a good mood is to face everything, good or bad, with a positive attitude.
#821$#I fully believe that this is the path to leading a happy and stress-free life.|
46215|#821$#Just being with a great Envoy of Gaia such as you fills me with joy!|
46216|#823$# Ha... A smile on one's face does not always mean happiness, don't you agree?|
46221|Do you know of the Miasmic Serpent, Quelkulan?|
46222|What's your relationship with Quelkulan?|
46223|#821$#Hmm? Oh, there's nothing particularly to mention about it. We've come across each other's paths often is all.|
46224|#821$#Hah, can you believe that many people mistake me for Quelkulan?
#823$#Once, even Gigas mistook me for him...and we almost got into a terrible fight over it!|
46225|#821$#Hmm, well... I don't have the amazing poison techniques that Quelkulan has.
#822$#So, I guess, in that area I may have a bit to learn.|
46226|#822$#Quelkulan and I do seem a little alike, it's true...
#823$#I expect that he tries to support you as well as I do, right?|
46231|Where do you live?|
46232|What kind of environment do you like to live in?|
46233|#821$#I prefer to dwell in the depths of the whirlpool, hidden in the ocean deep.
#823$#I find it to be the best place to contemplate my existence...|
46234|#823$#Long, long ago, I lived in a place that I once called "Paradise."
#821$#But I ended up moving out - I much prefer my new home.|
46235|#823$#For me, being in the deepest ocean is the same as living on the ground as humans do.
#822$#I know everything happening in the world through communicating with the ocean's many creatures.|
46236|#821$#Sometimes, I'm not so sure if my current dwelling is as good as the Paradise I once lived.
#822$#However, the quiet of the sea is an excellent place for thinking...|
46241|Do you know any Eidolon secrets?|
46242|Any interesting gossip going around about the Eidolons?|
46243|#821$#I used to see Uzuriel quite often, but she has become more secretive of late.
#824$#I wonder how she is doing now...|
46244|#822$#Heh, well, Zaahir is a rude guy with an extremely high body temperature, you know?
#824$#These attributes of his remind me of my elder brother every time I see him.|
46245|#822$#Sigrun is a reliable friend full of vim and vigor.
#823$#The only problem I have with her is that she sometimes speaks a but too bluntly. As such, some people tend to keep their distance from her...|
46246|#823$#Hmm... Vermilion is a quiet girl.
#822$#She's very attached to that birt she keeps around. It's as though the two have a spiritual connection.|
46251|Do you like cold weather?|
46252|You look so pale, are you cold?|
46253|#822$#Although I may look pale, the cold doesn't really affect me at all.
#821$#Rather, I actually enjoy the cold weather quite a bit!|
46254|#823$#The Whirlpool Abyss where I live is always under high pressure and extremely low temperatures.
#821$#Once you live in a place such as that, you become accustomed to such cold climates.|
46255|#822$#Ah, do you dislike the cold?
#823$#It doesn't bother me at all. In fact, I rather love the cold weather!|
46256|#823$#Oh! This is actually the first time I've ever been asked this.
#821$#See my scales? They actually cover me so perfectly that I retain all my body heat.
#822$#Cold water is no threat to me as long as my scales are in good shape!|
46261|Do you have any hopes and dreams?|
46262|What wish would you love to come true?|
46263|#822$#I don't want too much, really. As long as I keep fighting by your side, I think I'll be happy!|
46264|#821$#Actually, I haven't seen my family in thousands of years...
#824$#I'd...really like to see them again if given the chance.|
46265|#821$#Hm? What's got you asking these questions? Do you really care about me that much?
#822$#Lately, with you, I've been pretty happy in my life. My main hope is for us to continue to succeed in all our goals.|
46266|#822$#Enough about me, how about I ask you a question?
#823$#What are your hopes and dreams? It would make me happiest if I could help you attain all your goals!|
46271|How does it feel to control the tides?|
46272|Is it difficult to be master of the seas?|
46273|#821$#Hmm, it's a bit hard to explain the feeling of becoming one with the raging seas...
#824$#Please forgive me, I just have no idea how to explain this one right now!|
46274|#821$#I don't know if humans have anything similar, but becoming one with the tide is the most amazing feeling in the world.
#822$#Just imagine being one with one of the most powerful elements in our world...
#823$#It is a truly marvelous feeling, indeed!|
46275|#822$#When I ride the tide, I feel as if I am the sea itself, as if we share a heartbeat...
#821$#Perhaps, someday, you'll be able to experience a feeling as great as this.|
46276|#823$#Sometimes I simply enjoy relaxing on top of the waves while I enjoy the rhythms of the ocean currents.
#822$#I only remember where I am when I feel a wave crashing against a rock!|
46281|Do you like the ocean?|
46282|What makes the ocean so special to you?|
46283|#821$#I'm not sure I "like" the ocean...but I do feel deeply attached to it.
#824$#After thousands of years, the sea is the only thing that stays with me and never changes.|
46284|#822$#Initially I had no particular interest in the ocean, I just came here out of obligation.
#823$#After so much time has passed, however, I've grown to feel as one with the great oceans.|
46285|#823$#Hah! I reside in the deepest oceans, how could I dislike it?
#821$#That's enough about me, what about you? Do you enjoy the deep blue oceans too?|
46286|#821$#I believe that the ocean is critical for the life of all things on Terra.
#823$#As someone who's life is intertwined with the ocean, I have a deep sense of gratitude towards it.|
46291|If we ever had to part ways, what would your plans be?|
46292|What are your plans after we part ways?|
46293|#821$#If that day ever comes, I hope that I would have at least fulfilled all your wishes and served you well on this great land.|
46294|#822$#I have experienced such things before, as I have been alive for as long as the ocean's current flows.
#821$#The day will come, of course, but when it does we should not feel sad. Let us remember the good times.|
46295|#821$#If the day comes that we finally must part ways...
#823$#Well, I'll wish for the best for you in your future endeavors.|
46296|#821$#I will retire to the deepest abyss of the ocean.
#822$#While there, I will continue carrying out my tasks as a dragon of the oceans, fulfilling my age old promises...|
46401|How do you go about training?|
46402|How can I become as strong as you are?|
46403|#822$#Strength must come from within.
#821$#You need to train the body and the mind as one.
#823$#Because of this, I spend as much time meditating as I do practicing for battle.|
46404|#822$#Even the most basic training regiment is not a wasted effort.
#821$#So long as you are pushing yourself, you will make progress.|
46405|#821$#Hmm... You must have knowledge, understanding, courage, and diligence.
#824$#If all of these attributes work in harmony, you can achieve anything.|
46406|#821$#We are all so different... I can only give you so much advice.
#822$#What works for me might not work for you,
#824$#so feel free to experiment to find the best method.|
46411|Do you have any weaknesses?|
46412|Are there things that you fear?|
46413|#821$#We all have weaknesses, and some are difficult to admit.
#824$#I carry a poison inside of my body. I can cope with it, but if it were to be released it may endanger many lives.|
46414|#822$#I fear that one day I might not be able to fly any more.
#824$#To be confined to the ground again seems a fate worse than death.|
46415|#821$#I worry that I am already the fastest dragon in the world.
#822$#Wouldn't that be just awful? There would be no one left to challenge.|
46416|#821$#I fear losing my abilities. What if I could no longer control the winds?
#822$#I suppose I would adapt after a time, but the thought still worries me.|
46421|What do you think it means to be powerful?|
46422|What is strength to you?|
46423|#821$#Ha! That you have to ask shows how different you and I are.
#822$#The answer, friend, is speed. Speed is power!
#823$#What good does all the muscle in the world do if you cannot hit your target?|
46424|#821$#I will swear by speed over outright strength.
#822$#Those who can dance around their opponents can control the battle as they please.|
46425|#821$#I am of the opinion that simply avoiding attacks is far more powerful than suffering them.
#823$#Put on some nimble gear that ups your EVA and see for yourself!|
46426|#823$#Ha! I control entire battles simply by being nimble!
#821$#How about you, friend? What is your definition of power?|
46431|What do you like doing in your spare time?|
46432|Tell me about your hobbies.|
46433|#821$#I love to eat snakes!
#823$#Few things are as wonderful as chowing down a slithering handful of serpents... Delicious!|
46434|#821$#I love the mountains. Whenever I see a tall peak, I must fly to the top and let out a huge howl.
#823$#It's wonderful stress relief! Next time I will take you with me.|
46435|#824$#Ha! Um... This is a bit embarrassing, but...
#822$#Who needs hobbies when they have an Envoy like you to travel with? I could do this all day, every day!|
46436|#822$#You know all of those adventures you and I have gone on, all those monsters we have faced?
#823$#In my spare time, I've been writing all of them into a journal!|
46441|Do you like riddles?|
46442|Are you good at word games?|
46443|#824$#Ugh! I don't see the point. I have no patience for those sort of games.|
46444|#822$#If it means that much to you, I suppose I can play along. 
#824$#But if you ask me to bet with real money, I swear I will leave and never come back. Seriously.|
46445|#821$#I really don't understand the point of them. At all.
#824$#Why waste so much energy with trivial, pointless matters? It boggles the mind.|
46446|#823$#It's difficult enough to speak clearly and concisely; why someone would deliberately obfuscate their speech is beyond me.|
46451|What's so special about Ventos Prairie?|
46452|Can you tell me anything about the Ventos Prairie?|
46453|#821$#I've been to the Ventos Prairie many times!
#823$#I love the sound of the wind as it rustles softly through the tall grass.|
46454|#821$#The Ventos Prairie is very beautiful, and is home to the strong and proud Makar tribe.
#822$#However, the Makar also seem to be quite arrogant, and don't get along easily with outsiders.|
46455|#821$#An ancient circle of stones in the Ventos Prairie is used as a combat arena.
#822$#There the Makar hold great tournaments to compete for their tribe's highest honors.|
46456|#821$#In a dark corner of the Ventos Prairie is a mysterious building called the Wrathborne Temple.
#821$#Surrounding it is a strange aura, as if there was some terrifying and otherworldly presence inside.|
46461|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
46462|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
46463|#821$#We Eidolons hold the Cube of Gaia in the highest regard.
#822$#How could we not? It created this world and all the life in it.|
46464|#823$#The Cube of Gaia created me, and gave me the powers I have.
#821$#Sometimes I do stop and think what might have happened if I was not given these powers...
#822$#What would my life be like now?|
46465|#821$#The ability to create life is so strange, almost mythical.
#824$#That is why people all across the world want the Cube of Gaia for themselves.|
46466|#822$#It's impossible to imagine what the Cube of Gaia might be like. How big is it? What would it be like to touch it?|
46471|Tell me more about Secondary Classes.|
46472|What's up with Secondary Classes?|
46473|#821$#When you reach level 40, you can learn how to use a Secondary Class.
#823$#This allows you to use a second weapon type and all of it's associated skills!|
46474|#821$#Certain combinations of classes will allow you to perform devastating Dual Skills.
#822$#Take a look through your Envoy's Path to see what ones you can learn.|
46475|#821$#Once you pick a Secondary Class, you're stuck with it!
#823$#Make sure you have carefully considered your fighting style before you choose your Secondary Class.|
46476|#822$#Choose a Secondary Class that complements your Primary Class, and you can become much stronger!|
46481|I'd like to learn more about skills!|
46482|What do you know about skills?|
46483|#821$#Some skills just deal damage, while others inflict debilitating effects. Sometimes both!
#824$#Are you saying you didn't know that? Are you sure you're qualified to be an Envoy?|
46484|#822$#There are fiends out there with truly vicious skills; some that can even wipe you out in a single hit!
#821$#Fortunately, you have plenty of skills of your own to counteract these.|
46485|#821$#Raising your SPD stat also decreases the cooldown time of all your skills!
#823$#If you want to use your big-hitting skills as often as possible, you'll need plenty of SPD.|
46486|#821$#Every Eidolon has a Combo skill that is supremely powerful, but with a very long cooldown.
#822$#You must use your head to determine the best time to use these skills.|
46491|Tell me what you know about Fame Quests.|
46492|What's so special about Fame Quests?|
46493|#821$#Such enthusiasm! I didn't know you were interested in Mirabelle's charity group. Or are you just interested in the rewards?|
46494|#822$#Fame Quests can be found posted on Mirabelle's Bulletin Board.
#823$#All sorts of interesting quests can be found there; investigations, rescue operations, treasure hunts... You should check it out.|
46495|#821$#Fame Quests get posted every day on the bulletin board in each zone.
#822$#If you don't see any suitable quests to undertake, try again the next day.|
46496|#821$#Of course, no Fame Quest would be complete without a luxurious reward from the requester.
#823$#It's even been said that occasionally someone will offer rare gear you can't get anywhere else!|
46501|How fast can you fly?|
46502|What's your top flight speed?|
46503|#822$#Some people think that I utilize the wind in order to fly.
#821$#This is not the case! I fly so quickly that I create the wind itself!
#823$#What could be faster than that?|
46504|#821$#Ha! At top speed, I am even faster than sound.
#823$#Even the sound of my roar is left behind me.|
46505|#821$#I fly so quickly, it's impossible for someone to focus on me. I appear as just a green blur.
#823$#This is how I earned the nickname of the Emerald Tempest.|
46506|#821$#Haha! Don't you worry about a thing!
#823$#My speed is more than enough to keep you safe on the battlefield.|
46511|Can you tell me the secret of your golden wings?|
46512|What is so special about your golden wings?|
46513|#822$#My wings? There are no other wings like them anywhere!
#821$#They give me the ability to launch through the sky at top speed, and then come to a stop immediately.
#823$#My golden wings give me both speed and the ability to control that speed.|
46514|#821$#Ha! Since you asked so politely...
#822$#My wings aren't just for mobility; they also let me engage many enemies.
#823$#If I flap them with enough force, they can send out shockwaves. How cool is that?|
46515|#821$#My wings can transmute some of the poison inside of my body,
#823$#then release it to power up my allies!|
46516|#824$#I can't go giving away all of my secrets, can I?
#822$#I suppose it doesn't matter. What would someone like you do with my secrets?
#823$#Ha! It would take you centuries to learn how to fly like I do!|
46521|Tell me about your claws.|
46522|Is there anything special about your claws?|
46523|#822$#Tell you about my claws? Okay...
#821$#Actually, I think you might still be too weak to understand.
#824$#My claws are infinitely profound; only the most wisened mind can grasp their true nature.|
46524|#822$#A long time ago I received a blessing from a dear friend, which allowed my claws to harness the wind.|
46525|#821$#My claws? Ha! There is nothing sharper in all the lands!
#822$#In my youth, I would fly about so recklessly...
#823$#If a mountain appeared in my path, I would just slice it in half and keep on going!|
46526|#821$#With just a turn of my palm, my claws can summon the wind to them.
#823$#That wind gives me incredible speed and strength.|
46531|Have you been surrounded by enemies before?|
46532|How do you deal with being surrounded by enemies?|
46533|#821$#Ha! If I am ever outnumbered, I will just spread my wings and fly away!|
46534|#822$#Let them try! I can stir up a ferocious wind that will blow away any number of enemies that try and surround me.|
46535|#821$#To be surrounded assumes you have let someone get behind you...
#823$#Which has yet to ever happen to me, thanks to my unbeatable speed!|
46536|#824$#I must admit that this has never happened to me.
#821$#My speed and my ability to fly has kept anyone from ever getting the drop on me.
#822$#Sometimes I wonder how I would handle it if I were to be surrounded...|
46541|Tell me about the other Eidolons.|
46542|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
46543|#821$#Sigrun is a bold and noble warrior who is completely uninterested in anything mundane.
#822$#She never beats around the bush; she laughs when she is happy and shouts when she is angered.
#823$#I appreciate her straightforward nature, and have always enjoyed our conversations.|
46544|#821$#My friend Aelius is a tremendous artist, gifted in music and poetry.
#822$#He just always looks so sad under that hood. I wonder what's eating him.|
46545|#822$#Oh, Bel-Chandra... You might want to keep your distance from her.
#821$#Outwardly she seems beautiful, and dances with an unmatched grace.
#824$#But she is truly frightening when she is angry! I still have nightmares...|
46546|#823$#Kotonoha is beautiful and kind, and in particular loves all small animals.
#822$#It's strange, though. Other than foxes, animals don't seem to like her very much.
#821$#Huh. I wonder why that is.|
46551|How does it feel to harness the wind?|
46552|What does it feel like to manipulate the wind?|
46553|#821$#Hmm... It's a unique feeling that's difficult to put into words.
#822$#How about this... When you have some free time, I'll take you for a ride up in the sky.
#823$#You can experience for yourself what it's like to fly!|
46554|#821$#To harness the winds is like ruling the world.
#823$#When you are in flight, all the creatures of the world can only watch and admire you!|
46555|#821$#It is like I have become one with the winds, and I breathe as the world itself breathes.|
46556|#821$#It is a very comfortable openness.
#822$#It is a sense of freedom unlike anything you've ever felt before.
#823$#Plus, doing loop-de-loops is an incredible amount of fun!|
46561|Where do you come from?|
46562|Where did you live before now?|
46563|#822$#I used to live in a palace on the highest peak of a steep mountain very far from here.
#821$#One wing of the palace had a tower that reached up into the clouds...
#822$#I smile whenever I think about it. Those were good times.|
46564|#822$#The palace I once lived in is far more magnificent than anything you've seen built on the ground.
#824$#The ancient sky-builders were far more advanced than any architect you have now.|
46565|#821$#It was a mysterious palace, full of huge murals inside and out.
#824$#These murals told stories of events that took place many millenia ago. I wish I'd taken the time to learn them all...|
46566|#822$#Is it really that important where I lived in the past? My life in the present is happy enough.|
46571|Do you have a partner?|
46572|Do you have many friends?|
46573|#821$#Yes, I do. My longtime friend and ally is a great and powerful king.
#822$#We have both saved one another's lives many times.|
46574|#822$#My closest friend is a powerful king of the old lands.
#821$#He's very much like you; a human with big dreams.|
46575|#821$#I had many allies in the long years of feuding and wars that preceded your known history.
#822$#It would take many months to tell you all of my stories!|
46576|#822$#You remind me of Ruyi, a friend of mine from long ago.
#821$#He passed his draconic powers onto me when he passed away, which is why I can control the wind.|
46581|Why do I never hear you roar like other dragons?|
46582|What's the secret of the dragon's roar?|
46583|#821$#My roar is unbearable. The noise is as frightening as the chilling cries of battle-field crows, only a hundred times as loud.|
46584|#822$#I cannot roar without releasing some of the poison trapped inside my body.
#824$#It would put you, and everyone else, at risk.|
46585|#821$#If I were to roar, I would release a toxic vapor.
#822$#Soon the entire world would be covered in poisonous clouds, and would become a wasteland.|
46586|#824$#It's not that I can't roar, it's that I choose not to.
#821$#If I roar, I will also release a deadly poison. I can't bring myself to do this.|
46591|What do you plan to do once our adventures together come to an end?|
46592|What would you do if we were to part ways?|
46593|#821$#Yes, one day we will no longer travel together, but we will still remember one another, right?
#822$#Just take a look up at the big wide sky... That's me waving to you!|
46594|#823$#I'll always remember our friendship, and I'll still root for you even if the whole world separates us.|
46595|#822$#I think I'll take some time to fly around and enjoy the feel of the wind before I decide what to do next.|
46596|#821$#Goodbye doesn't have to be forever, does it?
#823$#We may part, but I believe we'll reunite again at some point.|
46701|What are your thoughts on the battle?|
46702|What does a battle mean to you?|
46703|#822$#That's simple. Squash the enemies! Where did you get so many points of view?|
46704|#821$#Total commitment and
#822$#the honor of crossing swords with a worthy opponent. Such is battle.
#821$#If not for that, wouldn't it just be ordinary fighting? Haha!|
46705|#821$#Instead of talking about it, why not just have a quick battle?
#822$#Let's get right down to it. Battle me now!
#821$#I'm sure you would soon understand. Haha!|
46706|#822$#What kind of question is that?
#821$#I want something, you want something else. So we battle. It's as simple as that!|
46711|What about shopping?|
46712|Do you like to shop?|
46713|#821$#I'm not a shopaholic or anything, but if there's something that catches my attention, I'll definitely buy it!
#822$#But of course, if you have something that you have your eye on, you can always tell me.|
46714|#821$#Are you asking me to go shopping with you?
#822$#I'm alright with that,
#821$#But don't think I'm gonna carry your stuff!|
46715|#822$#And if Tsubaki and the girls are coming, count me out.
#824$#No... not because they will ask me to pay. I'm fine with spotting anyone a little cash.
#822$#it's because they always give me their stuff to carry! Plus they have horribly tacky taste. I can't be seen around them in public!|
46716|#821$#Haha. Of course I will go with you,
#822$#Buy whatever you want, don't worry about money.|
46721|What are your weaknesses?|
46722|Is there anything you aren't good at?|
46723|#822$#I have no idea how to deal with plants.
#824$#I like them, but no matter how hard I try not to, I end up burning them up.
#822$#It's my fault, I know. I'm just totally inept.|
46724|#822$#Haha! Can't figure out a way to beat me, can you? Haha!
#821$#Better fight me a few more times and maybe you'll find a weakness, if I have one that is.|
46725|#821$#I have no weaknesses!
#822$#Does it look like I have any weaknesses? Just look at me!|
46726|#821$#Weakness is a fallacy.
#822$#Self actualize and you'll soon overcome any obstacle! See it, then be it! Haha!|
46731|What about if there's someone that needs help?|
46732|What do you think about helping those in need?|
46733|#822$#If I see there's someone that needs my help, I will definitely help them without any hesitation!
#821$#Such is the responsibility of the strong and the powerful.|
46734|#821$#We should always help those who are in need!
#822$#What's the point in being strong or having riches if we can't help those who need it?
#821$#If everyone bands together, there's no problem we can't solve! Haha!|
46735|#822$#Why do you ask? Do you feel weak?
#821$#Haha! Stop lying to yourself!
#821$#You're stronger than most people I know.|
46736|#822$#A strong person who ignores those in need is not strong at all.
#822$#To have weak morals is much worse than being physically weak. Don't you think?|
46741|What are your thoughts on family?|
46742|What does family mean to you?|
46743|#822$#Family... when you are in the darkest of times,
#824$#you know you can always count on your family.|
46744|#821$#Your family will always be honest with you. They'll give you advice when you make mistakes,
#822$#as well as unconditional trust and confidence till the very end...
#821$#Haha! That's dampened the mood. Let's talk about something else!|
46745|#821$#Haha! You want to meet my family?
#822$#Perhaps, one day.|
46746|#824$#Sometimes family disagreements are the most difficult ones to work out...
#822$#Yes? Aelius and I have shared similar experiences, do you suggest I should talk to him?
#821$#Yeah, that sounds quite useful. Thanks!|
46751|Do you know the Viridian Steppe?|
46752|Please tell me about the Viridian Steppe.|
46753|#821$#Oh? So you want to go to places outside of Midgard?
#822$#It's good to embark on a new adventure.
#821$#Let me know when you go! I'd love to tag along.|
46754|#822$#I hear they have special minerals in that place...
#821$#Why don't we go there and have a look!
#822$#Don't worry about the journey expenses. I got it covered! Haha!|
46755|#821$#You actually want to explore other continents?
#822$#The Viridian Steppe's quite an interesting place to visit, so I hear...
#821$#I'd suggest that you go there and see for yourself.|
46756|#822$#It's on the Continent of Principia!
#821$#It's a very different sort of place than Midgard,
#822$#you'll have to experience it for yourself to find out more.|
46761|Do you know what the centaurs are?|
46762|What do you think of the centaurs?|
46763|#821$#As far as I know they're a tribe that can predict the future by observing the stars,
#824$#I have no idea how they can do that.
#822$#What's so special about stars?|
46764|#821$#Their tribe lives on the Continent of Principia. I've heard they are experts in the ancient art of astrology.
#822$#I'm interested in finding out more about how they make their predictions.
#821$#Does fate really have something to do with the movement of the stars?|
46765|#821$#Centaurs? That's the tribe that protects the Life Tree.
#822$#Though I don't quite understand why they need to protect a tree...
#821$#Either way, they seem to have a unique way with plants!|
46766|#821$#Haha! They are a tree-loving tribe!
#822$#I wish I could take a look at that Life Tree, of theirs,
#821$#But I'm so bad around plants, I'd be worried I might just burn down the tree... I'm a menace! Not fit for polite society. Haha!|
46771|What's the Mirabelle Group?|
46772|Have you heard of the Mirabelle Group?|
46773|#821$#From what I've heard, they're experts in doing odd jobs!
#822$#They receive requests from all over of the world...
#821$#You could probably have some fun working with them.|
46774|#821$#I've heard that they are a group that specializes in handling various requests from all over of the world.
#821$#Maybe you could try it out for yourself if you're interested.
#821$#Of course, remember to take me with you!|
46775|#822$#Each region has its own bulletin board
#821$#so you can check out quests that interest you.
#822$#And, of course, you will get a reward for any quest you manage to complete.|
46776|#822$#Seems to be some organization that helps people publicize their requests,
#821$#I don't really know.
#822$#You could go give it a try? Haha!|
46781|What's the Azuria Popularity Ranking?|
46782|Have you heard of the Azuria Popularity Ranking?|
46783|#821$#It appears to show who's the most popular. Take a look, you can even use it to send some flowers.|
46784|#821$#It's something about who's the most popular!
#821$#Like some kind of idol contest? Haha! Yes, a bit.
#822$#Imagine how you would feel if you got first prize!|
46785|#822$#It's a contest that shows how popular you are!
#821$#You can also send some flowers to your friends.
#822$#It's a great way to show your generosity! Haha!|
46786|#822$#It's is a contest to see who gets sent the most flowers!
#821$#You seem to be quite popular. You must have received quite a few, don't you think?|
46791|How do I make my equipment sparkle?|
46792|How do you make things all glittery?|
46793|#822$#Enhance your equipment enough,
#821$#and it will glitter after some time!|
46794|#821$#Oh? I didn't know that you were trying to bedazzle your items.
#821$#It's simple, actually. Enhance the equipment to its highest level to get that sparkling shine!|
46795|#821$#Tear up all your spare equipment into Gaia Fragments, then use them to enhance your favorite equipment.
#822$#Once it's at its highest level, step back and watch the sparkle! But what if it fails?
#821$#Try and try again! It'll work eventually! Might take a while, though... Haha!|
46796|#821$#Put some gold plating on the equipment and it will glitter...
#822$#Haha! Just kidding. You look so annoyed! Okay, I'll tell you the secret.
#821$#Just enhance your equipment to the highest level to get it to glitter.|
46801|I've heard that you have a huge pile of treasure?|
46802|You always seem to have lots and lots of treasure.|
46803|#821$#I do keep lots of treasure. What did you expect? I'm a dragon. It's kinda our thing.
#822$#But I'm not telling you where I keep it! Maybe one day... If you're nice.
#821$#But don't count on it. Haha!|
46804|#821$#So, you want to know my secrets do you? Are you jealous of my treasure?
#822$#Let me just warn you, these treasures have been cursed, so you will die if you touch them...
#821$#You really believe that? Would I be standing here if that was true?|
46805|#821$#Oh? You want some treasure too, do you?
#822$#I can give you some.
#821$#If you say the magic word, that is! Haha!|
46806|#822$#I just like shiny things, really.
#824$#Haha! It's not even all very valuable. Some if it's just stuff I found that I thought looked pretty.
#822$#Maybe one day I'll show you my stash!|
46811|Do you have any treasure that has been cursed?|
46812|I heard some treasure was protected by dangerous curses!|
46813|#821$#These treasures are alright. What's scarier is the bunch of people always trying to steal them.
#823$#I think they would do anything to get their hands on a bit of treasure.
#822$#Even hurt their friends! That's why the treasures have earned a reputation as being under some type of curse.|
46814|#821$#Honestly, sometimes keeping all that treasure is more trouble than it's worth, I tell ya.
#824$#People come so often trying to steal them in the middle of the night, I can barely get a good night's sleep.
#822$#Tell me, isn't that a curse too?|
46815|#822$#It's all just rumors created by a bunch of jealous people.
#821$#The treasure itself is under no curse. It's the greedy treasure hunters who are cursed.|
46816|#821$#Actually, once all the magma in my body cools down, it will also turn into treasure.
#821$#And because of this power, even my own father tried to kill me.
#821$#So you could say it's actually me who has been cursed, not the treasure.|
46821|I've heard that your heart contains some magical power?|
46822|Is it true what I've heard about your heart?|
46823|#821$#Haha! I've heard that rumor too!
#822$#The rumor is that those who eat my heart can gain wisdom.|
46824|#821$#My heart actually contains a special magma,
#822$#and legend has it that ingesting it will let you live forever...
#821$#But, it's basically the same as drinking hot lava. So, do you really want to take that chance?|
46825|#821$#My heart produces the magma you see all over my body!
#822$#I've heard that it functions the same way as a human heart,
#821$#just that instead of blood I've got hot magma inside my veins. Haha!|
46826|#821$#Do you want me to take out my heart and let you see it?
#822$#I could show you it, there's just one problem... the whole place will then turn into a raging sea of fire.
#821$#And everything you see will be burnt up in a hellish inferno... Magma heart, you see...|
46831|Has anyone managed to make off with any of your treasure?|
46832|Treasure theft?|
46833|#821$#Haha! Who's been telling you stories?
#822$#My treasure is locked up tight!
#821$#Anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar.|
46834|#821$#You want some treasure, huh? Okay, let's have a thumb wrestle. If you win, I'll give you all the treasure.
#822$#but if you lose, you have to give me all your money. Got it? You don't want to?
#821$#Why not? Ya scared?|
46835|#821$#No, my treasures haven't been stolen, but I did once give some to a human.
#824$#I heard that afterwards, his life took a turn for the worse.
#822$#I was thinking, do all humans really change once they have money?|
46836|#821$#Some treasure thieves are excellent fighters,
#822$#but I'm more than a match for most of them. Anyone who tries to steal my treasure
#821$#usually ends up regretting their decision. Haha!|
46841|Do you have any siblings?|
46842|Do you have any siblings?|
46843|#822$#I don't like talking about my family.
#822$#Can we move on to another question?|
46844|#822$#A long time ago, my old man tried to kill me to try to get my heart power.
#822$#I had no choice but to tell my younger brother to leave the house, and then do away with the crazy old man...
#824$#I always felt there must have been some misunderstanding, but it was too late. There was no going back.|
46845|#822$#I do have a younger brother. But, I don't really like to talk about family stuff...
#824$#Maybe another time, okay?
#822$#Let's just pretend you never asked that question.|
46846|#822$#Yes, but I think he doesn't want to see me!
#824$#We've had our differences, let's just say that.
#822$#I just hope that he's doing well, wherever he is...|
46851|Someone told me that you are greedy.|
46852|Are you as greedy as they say?|
46853|#821$#That depends on what the item is,
#822$#if it's a large, freshly caught lobster...
#821$#Yes, I will be greedy. Those things are delish. Haha!|
46854|#822$#Just cause I've got a big pile of treasure doesn't mean I'm greedy!
#821$#I'm pretty generous with it, I like to think!|
46855|#822$#It's not greed that makes me collect treasure. Not at all!
#822$#It's just that I see how much trouble is caused by treasure in the hands of men. So I figured everyone would be better off if I just guard it myself.
#821$#Maybe I'm just crazy though. Haha!|
46856|#821$#Yes, everyone loves to call a dragon greedy.
#822$#It's just laziness! It's quite rude.
#821$#People should try to get to know someone before they make those kinds of comments.|
46861|What are you wearing?|
46862|Your body always seems to be covered in flowing magma?|
46863|#821$#Haha! I call it the "Melting Flame".
#822$#You're right. It is formed by concentrated magma flowing all over my body,
#821$#but as it doesn't entirely solidify, you can still see the magma flowing in some parts.|
46864|#821$#Haha! I wouldn't touch it if I were you. The surface is so hot that it is semi molten at all times,
#822$#and ordinary weapons melt just from being left too close.|
46865|#821$#It's not clothes. What you're seeing is the flame formed by the magma flowing all over my body.
#822$#The high temperature of the magma always singes the surrounding grasses.
#824$#I'm a pretty bad house guest, let's just say that.|
46866|#821$#It is the same as the lava flowing inside my body,
#822$#the difference is that on the outside it cools down into a rock hard armor.
#822$#Don't I wear it well, though? Haha!|
46871|Do you have any juicy gossip about the other Eidolons?|
46872|Hmmm, Eidolon gossip?|
46873|#822$#Well, Quelkulan and Nazrudin look the same,
#824$#but ask them, and they will tell you that they're not at all related...
#822$#But I'm not sure I believe them!|
46874|#822$#Kaiser Zeta is usually very active and full of vigor, but he will get cagey when it comes to answering important questions.
#821$#It's like he's got two constantly alternating temperaments...
#822$#Tell me, isn't that a dual personality?|
46875|#822$#Zaahir had planned to build a greenhouse, and he even put some plants in a pot and brought the pot back.
#821$#He said he wanted to grow his own garden... And guess what happened after?
#822$#He totally forgot about his molten breath, so he ended up burning up all his plants! Haha!|
46876|#822$#Diao Chan seems to be some eastern beauty... She's super talented in all types of arts.
#824$#The only problem is how selfish she is, it's shocking... She really seems to stress out the others as well.|
46881|Someone said you used to be another species before you turned into a dragon.|
46882|Were you always a dragon?|
46883|#822$#Let me guess. You heard that from the dwarves, didn't you?
#821$#Dwarves like to think they have a special relationship with us dragons, but let me tell you, there's no way to transform a dwarf into a dragon.
#822$#Of course I was born a dragon!|
46884|#821$#What an insulting question. I never expected you to be a truther.
#822$#I have always been a dragon, from the moment I was born.|
46885|#821$#Haha! What kind of question is that? I was born a dragon, and grew up as a dragon.
#822$#Or do you know a way to transform other species into dragons?|
46886|#821$#Haha! Tell me, what do you think I used to be?
#822$#A lizard? A slug? A fly? Rather a slug than a human at least. Haha!|
46891|What do you plan to do once our adventures together come to an end?|
46892|What would you do if we separated?|
46893|#821$#Haha! Why are you thinking so much about what might happen in the future?
#822$#Isn't it better to just focus on the present?|
46894|#822$#You mean you don't want me on your next journey?
#824$#That's pretty hurtful. I guess I'll just go back to that uncomfortable treasure pile and go to sleep on it!|
46895|#822$#Don't think about that too much. I promise, you will be alright as long as I'm here.
#824$#You trust me, don't you?|
46896|#822$#Hmm? Why think about things that will not happen?
#824$#I'd never leave you, ol' buddy!|
47001|What is your favorite leisure activity?|
47002|How do you usually kill time?|
47003|#822$# I like to study the art of healing when I'm free, especially in the field of using venom to heal.  
#823$# Hsss... Venom doesn't have to hurt people. If the dosage is controlled, it can also be used to heal!|
47004|#821$# Sometimes I do nothing, and just contemplate silently.  Hssss... 
#824$# There's so much to learn from the world, if you just stop and look.|
47005|#822$# I try to develop venom's universal suitability for healing. I have been very successful to date.  
#823$# If you're interested, I can always use volunteers. I guarantee that you'll probably benefit from it!|
47006|#821$# I usually carry out research that's related to venom, a field filled with uncertainties.|
47011|Tell me about things that you hate.|
47012|What do you hate the most?|
47013|#822$# Hssss... What I hate most are people who stereotype others and throw me strange looks. 
#824$# I really don't get it sometimes - are snakes really so frightening?|
47014|#821$# Even though I can understand how others feel, I really don't wish to be hated just because of how I look.|
47015|#822$# There aren't many things that I hate. Usually it's the others who hate me.|
47016|#821$# Hsss... I really hate people who can't accept that others are different from them. 
#824$# Conflicts often occur when you have to deal with such people.|
47021|What's so good about travelling?|
47022|What can we learn when we travel?|
47023|#823$# The best thing about travelling is you are truly engaging this world. 
#822$# Hsss... Reading about it in books is not enough.|
47024|#821$# Hsss... You can make many new friends while travelling. Friends enrich your life.|
47025|#822$# Don't get hung up on the destination, or what you can get when you travel. 
#821$# As with all things, the most important thing is really the process of doing it.|
47026|#822$ Travelling gives you total freedom. You can decide your own direction, and your future.|
47031|What do you think knowledge is?|
47032|What's your definition of knowledge?|
47033|#823$ Hssss... There's a famous saying that goes, "knowledge is power." 
#822$ But have you ever considered whether power is equal to knowledge?|
47034|#821$ Hssss.... Knowledge can't be gained just by moving through life. 
#821$ You have to examine your experiences, if you want to learn from them.|
47035|#824$ Without knowledge, one is ignorant. But knowledge alone, without really living, is its own kind of ignorance.|
47036|#823$ Knowledge comes from experience, and experience is distorted by ego. Try to understand your own ego, so you can see the distortions.|
47041|What kind of climate do you like?|
47042|What kind of weather are you most comfortable in?|
47043|#823$# Hssss..... I feel most comfortable in warm, sunny weather. Cold weather makes me sleepy.|
47044|#822$# My skin is very sensitive to temperature. As soon as the temperature starts to change, I can feel it immediately.|
47045|#821$# Anyway, as long as the temperature doesn't change too quickly, I can accept all sorts of weather. 
#824$# Cold weather takes a while to get used to.|
47046|#824$# It's not that I'm weak, I just that I can't adapt to weather that fluctuates between hot and cold...|
47051|Have you heard about Pandemonium?|
47052|What's Pandemonium like?|
47053|#821$# Hssss... Pandemonium is truly another world - it's hard to describe to mortals.|
47054|#822$# It's said that Pandemonium is filled with terrifying things. I wonder if the demons who live there find Terra just as frightening.|
47055|#824$# Pandemonium is the residence of Demons. It seems to be quite turbulent recently, it could be that something has changed...|
47056|#823$# It's very difficult to go to Pandemonium from Terra. Strangely, it seems to be much easier to come here from other worlds...|
47061|Do you know that every place has its local specialties?|
47062|I hear that every place has its own unique, famous product?|
47063|#821$# The food of many areas is not only delicious, but can also give you bonus special skills.|
47064|#822$# To develop tourism, many cities and towns specially use local produce to make unique dishes.|
47065|#823$# The best way to relax from adventuring is to taste the local delicacies wherever you travel!|
47066|#821$# Hssss... Take care not to overeat when sampling delicacies. 
#824$# It's not worth it a bellyache, no matter how good it is.|
47071|I'd like to know more about casting and forging.|
47072|How do I make Enchanted Equipment?|
47073|#822$# It's said that, other than Knight Blacksmith Analisa, there's also an old man who can do it. 
#823$# I wonder who taught who?|
47074|#822$# As long as you've learned the formula, you can get forging and casting through Analisa of Navea. 
#821$# If you master this skill, all kinds of Enchanted Equipment will be at your fingertips!|
47075|#823$# Hssss... You can learn basic formulas from Knight Blacksmith Analisa. 
#821$# For the rarer formulas, you can only obtain them by defeating boss monsters in dungeons.|
47076|#821$# The greater your level of mastery with equipment casting, the better your chances of producing high quality equipment. 
#823$# If you want to have the very best equipment, work hard at improving your casting finesse!|
47081|Tell me about Full Set Effects.|
47082|I would like to know of Full Set Effects.|
47083|#823$# The Full Set Effect is not exclusive to store bought equipment and equipment that's dropped in the field. 
#822$# Equipment that's cast and forged by blacksmiths also has a Full Set Effect.|
47084|#821$# Hssss... Some equipment contains a specific Eidolons' Power of Gaia. 
#822$# If you manage to collect the full set, you will get the special protection of that particular Eidolon.|
47085|#823$# Hssss...Try to collect the full set of equipment that's dropped in an instance. 
#822$# This equipment, other than having a powerful Full Set Effect, can also be forged and cast further.|
47086|#823$# Hssss... Why do you suppose a full set of equipment it will trigger a special magic effect?
#824$# This is a question that's worth pondering over...|
47091|How can my Status be changed?|
47092|Please give me some tips on Statuses.|
47093|#821$# When one is adventuring, one will usually be affected by various statuses. 
#822$# Default status icons will show on the side of the small map. Check often.|
47094|#823$# Skills displayed by monsters will sometimes inflict very annoying negative statuses. 
#822$# If you try to avoid these, your battle will be much easier.|
47095|#822$# Hssss... Some statuses will greatly reduce your ability, and even bring you dangerously close to death. 
#823$# Always take note of your Status information, so as to improve your success in the battle.|
47096|#821$# Hssss... My venom is also a kind of status. 
#822$# Of course, it's the kind that really scares people.|
47101|Where does your Warm Mist come from?|
47102|Why is your recovery ability is so strong?|
47103|#823$# The tissues of my body are stimulated by my own venom, and heal continuously with shocking speed. 
#822$# This quick healing naturally contributes to my Warm Mist.|
47104|#822$# Hssss... This is hard to explain, as the relationship between my venom and my mist is complex.|
47105|#823$# As I'm filled with venom, my ability to recover is shocking. 
#821$# Hssss... You can understand my Warm Mist as an extension of this.|
47106|#822$# Hssss... Even though my Warm Mist is very strong, 
#824$# I still can't teach this ability to partners. What is a shame.|
47111|Have you caused trouble for others before?|
47112|Have you been a cause of trouble to others before?|
47113|#821$# Hssss... As my body is filled with venom, I easily intimidate other creatures. 
#824$# Which is why I'm very careful to maintain a safe distance with people.|
47114|#822$# Long, long ago, I once ruined a beautiful lake, in my carelessness. 
#824$# The locals suffered immensely, which is why I had to leave in a hurry...|
47115|#821$# Let's not talk about me for the moment. I guess you've also caused trouble for others before?|
47116|#822$# Hssss... The venom in my body has not only caused trouble for others. 
#824$# I even feel troubled by it myself, sometimes.|
47121|Is there a special use for your venom?|
47122|Can your venom be used for things outside of combat?|
47123|#822$# Hssss... It's said that some people will use venom to make food. 
#821$# I'm not sure it would be wise to use my venom like that...|
47124|#823$# Hssss... Venom is still venom. 
#822$# There are still few opportunities to use it outside of battle.|
47125|#823$# Hssss... You've really picked the right time to ask me this. 
#822$# I actually need a volunteer to help with some small experiments related to venom.|
47126|#823$# If my scales are ground into very fine powder, they can be made into antitoxins.  
#822$# It's just that effective dosage and fatal dosage are not that different.|
47131|Have you been almost fatally injured before?|
47132|Have you had near death experiences in battle?|
47133|#823$# Hssss... 
#821$# Actually, I don't have such strength as I had before. I  was very badly injured in a battle once... 
#822$# The flesh of my body changed, being affected by my own venom, leaving me as I am today.|
47134|#822$# Hssss... I can tell you that near death experiences aren't nice. 
#824$# You will lose your strength, slowly and surely, like a countdown to the end.|
47135|#821$# I was once very badly injured when I was fighting with other Eidolons.|
47136|#823$# In one fierce battle, my sworn enemy and I were both very badly injured, and we were both very close to death. 
#822$# However, I know that neither of us are afraid of death, as we are both fighting for our ideals.|
47141|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
47142|I want to hear gossip about the Eidolons.|
47143|#823$# Hssss... Word has it that Uzuriel once held a very mysterious, but important post in some organization. 
#822$# During that time, her nickname at the organization was "Left Hand."|
47144|#822$# Hssss... 
#824$# Gigas is the only one that I have nothing to tell you about.|
47145|#822$# Hssss... Tigerius Caesar got his title as the Feline Emperor due to his remarkable talent. 
#821$# There are still some people who are not willing to associate themselves with him. 
#823$# After all, talking to an arrogant and obnoxious person is quite an uncomfortable thing.|
47146|#822$# Hssss... The location of the underground command post of Bahadur's Army is a very closely kept secret.
#823$# Its internal passageways very complicated, which is why many people call it "the labyrinth."|
47151|How big are you?|
47152|Can you tell me how long you are?|
47153|#821$# Hssss... My length is my utmost pride. 
#822$# But I'm not sure exactly how long I really am.|
47154|#822$# Hssss... My body length? Why do you suddenly want to know this?|
47155|#823$# Hssss... My body length changes every year, 
#822$# I currently have 50 body segments, but I might have more next year.|
47156|#822$# A person's size is not a true representation of the person.
#821$# it's more important that he has substance.|
47161|How deadly is your venom?|
47162|How terrifying is your venom?|
47163|#823$# Hssss... As long as I'm willing, I can make a whole forest wither in an instant.|
47164|#821$# My venom is not only effective on living creatures.
#823$# It is  also effective against lifeless magic creatures and undead monsters.  
#822$# It can corrode their bodies till they fall apart!|
47165|#821$# Hsssss... My venom is definitely deadly.  
#822$# No matter how powerful the enemy is, he will gradually die after the venom spreads.|
47166|#824$# My venom cannot tell friend from foe. If you come across it accidentally, even I may not be able to save you...|
47171|Are you good at swimming?|
47172|Are you familiar with the water?|
47173|#822$# Hssss... I'm not afraid of water, but I will avoid rivers and lakes, so as to prevent my venom from spreading.|
47174|#823$# Hssss... I don't go near water because my scales are filled with venom. 
#822$# So I often avoid water, so that I don't cause unnecessary harm.|
47175|#824$# If there's ever an opportunity, I hope to enjoy myself to the fullest in the water.|
47176|#823$# Hssss... My movement in the water is also very fast.
#824$# I'll give you a chance to see it, next time.|
47181|How do you eat, usually?|
47182|Do you use your claws to put food into your mouth?|
47183|#821$# I simply open my mouth big and wide to swallow the food. Feeding myself is easy, even without hands.|
47184|#822$# Hssss... Have you seen animals eating with knife and fork? I think you haven't. 
#824$# So why would you think that snakes would need hands to eat? We just swallow the food directly.|
47185|#822$# Hsssss....When my lower jaw is stretched to its extreme, it can actually open to an incredible angle.
#823$# Therefore I just directly swallow my food when I eat.|
47186|#821$# Snakes are experts at swallowing food in one big gulp. Naturally, that includes me.|
47191|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what would you do next?|
47192|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what plans do you have after that?|
47193|#822$# Hssss... There's this saying, "All good things must come to an end." 
#821$# The day will come when we must finally say goodbye, but I won't forget you after we go our separate ways.|
47194|#823$# If we are separated, I'll continue to work hard at studying how venom can be used to heal.
#822$# Hopefully, one day I can bring better medicine to the people of this world.|
47195|#824$# Hssss... Separation doesn't mean that we won't ever see each other again. It's just that we both have our  own life directions.|
47196|#822$# I'll be touring around the world, contributing what I can to residents of remote areas.|
47301|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
47302|How do you kill time?|
47303|#821$# I like to lie on the grass and bask in the sun, when I've nothing else to do.
#822$# Unfortunately the grass always burns.|
47304|#823$# I train! Constant improvement can only come with persistent training!|
47305|#821$# What? I'm actually quite busy!
#822$# With what, you ask? Ha ha ha... I can't tell you.|
47306|#821$# Leisure activities? Hmm, well, I like bathing. 
#822$# I have to bathe quickly, as the water quickly turns to steam.|
47311|What is your favorite food?|
47312|Do you have a preference in food?|
47313|#823$# Strong as I am, I can eat anything, whatever it is!  
#821$# Most food is unsatisfying, though. It burns, even before I can put them into my mouth!|
47314|#822$# Hmm, well, I rather like the taste of lava! It's both crunchy and chewy.|
47315|#821$#  Aelius's flames taste good, but the texture is a bit too soft.  
#822$# Oh my, I really miss it! Gotta visit Aelius again!|
47316|#821$# As long as it's food that I can eat, I will eat it. 
#822$# It's not good to be picky with food, don't you think? Ha-ha!|
47321|What kind of weather do you like?|
47322|Any weather preferences?|
47323|#822$# Weather? For me, rainy and snowy weather are both quite troublesome! 
#821$# Rain and snow evaporate immediately, once they touch my skin. 
#822$# All the steam is irritating, but at least it gives me this mysterious look.|
47324|#821$# Do you really have to ask? My favorite weather is, of course, bright days where the sun is high and shining bright!|
47325|#822$# No matter what kind of weather it is, it'll be great if it's dry!  
#821$# Why? Steam is really very troubling....|
47326|#822$# Ha ha ha... Don't worry, don't worry. 
#823$# My fighting spirit will not diminish, just because of the weather!|
47331|What is a friend, as far as you are concerned?|
47332|What's the definition of friendship, in your heart?|
47333|#822$# A person who can share your joys and woes is a friend!|
47334|#821$# What? You have to ask something so obvious? 
#822$# Am I not your friend? Ha ha ha...|
47335|#821$# A friend is one who won't abandon you, even though he is so ashamed of you! 
#822$ Who am I talking about? I can't tell you, I'd be in so much trouble! Ha ha ha...|
47336|#822$ Whoever you think is your friend, is your friend! 
#821$ Friends are as simple as that, why over-think it?|
47341|What do you think about travelling?|
47342|Share your opinions on travelling with me?|
47343|#821$# I love to travel!
#822$# Aside from making new friends, this way I can also try new food.
#823$# Makes me hungry just talking about it! Ha-ha!|
47344|#822$# Are you going on a trip? How marvelous!
#821$# It's dangerous to go alone! Take me with you.|
47345|#821$# Travel? What's to think about? It's basically just going around, eating and drinking. 
#822$# Speaking of which, I remember this little volcano where I once spent the weekend...|
47346|#821$# Why are we talking about it, when we can just go!
#822$# The best way to know what traveling is like is to experience the adventure! 
#823$# Well? What are you waiting for?|
47351|What's special about the Infernal Abyss?|
47352|What do you know about the Infernal Abyss?|
47353|#822$# Hmm... I would think, with you and I being friends, that you would know of it already.
#823$# How can you have forgotten already?|
47354|#821$# To me, the Infernal Abyss is simply a game room, for killing... time.
#822$# For some reason, however, many Envoys of Gaia are going there to test themselves.
#823$# It certainly makes the place more interesting, ha ha!|
47355|#821$# Fine, fine... I'll tell you, but don't tell anyone else! 
#822$# The Infernal Abyss was an idea I had one day while I was bathing.
#823$# Just a little thought, haha!|
47356|#822$# It's satisfying to fight against those challengers.
#821$# I still need to take care of the fallen, though.
#824$# How terribly inconvenient!|
47361|What do you know about Pandemonium?|
47362|What is Pandemonium like?|
47363|#822$# Pandemonium? What makes you think I know anything about that place?
#824$# I am Zaahir of the Infernal Abyss, not Zaahir of Pandemonium!|
47364|#821$# Pandemonium is a place of decay and destruction.
#822$# Numerous demons and monsters live there, from what I've been told.
#824$# Life itself would be a punishment, for you, in Pandemonium.|
47365|#821$# Some people say that there is a region of Pandemonium entirely engulfed in flames.
#822$# It sounds delightful! I would love to visit there someday!|
47366|#821$# Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium are areas unaffected by time.
#822$# Physical rules in these realms are very different than they are here.|
47371|What is the Envoy's Path?|
47372|How should I choose my abilities in the Envoy's Path?|
47373|#821$# As you grow more powerful, you are able to unlock more areas in the Envoy's Path.
#822$# Different paths will give you different abilities that will be useful in battle.|
47374|#821$# If you're not sure where to go, try focusing on one area.
#822$# You are sure to improve if you keep focus on one area.|
47375|#824$# Humans are so troublesome! You have to actually accumulate XP to grow stronger!
#821$# I would die from boredom, if I had to do the same!|
47376|#821$# You seem so lost, so I'll help you out.
#822$# If you want to be good at PvP, learn skills which decrease your critical damage you take.
#823$# Definitely a life-saver, ha-ha!|
47381|Let's talk about equipment fortification.|
47382|What do you know about equipment fortification?|
47383|#821$# Fortifying equipment is a bold move!
#823$# Powerful equipment attracts attention, and challengers!|
47384|#821$# Equipment fortification can dramatically increase the existing attributes of your gear.
#822$# You can become stronger still when your gear reaches certain fortification levels.
#823$# Such important information - Don't forget it!|
47385|#821$# Disassembling equipment can give you Fragments. 
#822$# You can use these to enhance the rest of your gear.|
47386|#821$# Your fortification failed? No worries!
#823$# Keep at it - eventually you will get what you want!|
47391|What is the ranking system?|
47392|What do you know about the ranking system?|
47393|#821$# Placing well in a ranking list is a great honor for any Envoy of Gaia.
#822$# Not only will you be noticed for your accomplishments, but you'll also be rewarded for your hard work.|
47394|#823$# If there is ever a popularity ranking, I'll definitely be in first place! Ha!|
47395|#821$# Want to place well in a ranking list? You've come to the right person!
#822$# Keep collecting materials from instances, and you'll definitely see yourself up there one day!|
47396|#821$# Keep in mind that the rankings will occasionally reset.
#822$# So, if you don't make the rankings this time around, don't fret!
#823$# There's always next time.|
47401|How hot is your breath?|
47402|How hot can your breath get?|
47403|#821$# Well... I don't know. 
#822$# Why don't you come find out for yourself? 
#821$# Ha-ha, you look so scared! I'm only kidding, of course.|
47404|#823$# Who cares about the exact temperature? Being able to burn enemies to death is enough for me!|
47405|#821$# Hmm... Five or six thousand degrees? No, I think it's seven or eight thousand?  
#822$# Anyway it's around those temperatures! Hot enough, don't you think?|
47406|#822$# Hmmm... I'm not really clear about the exact temperature of my breath. 
#821$# I am certain that there is nothing in this world can withstand my breath!  
#822$# So what do you say, how hot should it be?|
47411|What's the pearl on your tail?|
47412|What's that pearl on your tail?|
47413|#821$# Oh, this little thing?
#822$# It's nothing special. Heh-heh-heh...|
47414|#821$# This is a gift given to me by the Cube of Gaia! 
#822$# It is precious to me...|
47415|#821$# It's a lovely decoration, isn't it? 
#822$# I'm not sure I want to talk about it...|
47416|#821$# I've learned that some things are better as mysteries.  
#822$# Perhaps you'll figure it out one day...|
47421|You look really like the Dragons, are you guys related?|
47422|Your appearance is very similar to the Dragons - are you one of them?|
47423|#822$# Ha ha ha... Foolish mortal, looking alike doesn't mean that we're related!|
47424|#821$# I'm probably more closely related to sprites than I am to dragons...|
47425|#823$# Oh? I don't want to be associated with those greedy good-for-nothings.|
47426|#822$# No worries. I'm no relation to the Dragons.
#821$# I was born of air and fire, not some mundane egg-hatching.|
47431|What's that on your back?|
47432|What's that behind your back?|
47433|#821$# This is my propeller! 
#822$# It looks good, right? Ha ha ha...|
47434|#821$# Oh, this? This is... uh...
#822$# I'll tell you later!|
47435|#822$# Eh? You don't know? 
#821$# Well, it's what it is. No more, no less!|
47436|#821$# This? It helps me to fly. 
#822$# Flying isn't my strong suit, eh-heh...|
47441|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
47442|Tell me some interesting tidbits about Eidolons.|
47443|#821$# Oh! I know something juicy about...someone...
#822$# Now, who was it...? 
#821$# Eh... Wait, let me think, who was it...?|
47444|#822$# Abraxas is a dashing young man with fine skills. 
#821$# But... He's a bit self-centered. Don't pick that up from him.|
47445|#822$# Nalani is very clever and kind - she's a good girl. 
#821$# Too bad she's so shy; to this day, I haven't heard her speak at all!|
47446|#822$# Tsubaki... I've come to a deep understanding of these words, thanks to her.  
#821$# "Better to offend a villain than a woman".  
#822$# When a woman takes revenge, she is far more formidable than a villain.....|
47451|Do you get hurt by your own breath?|
47452|Is your breath useful to you?|
47453|#822$# Hahaha! You amuse me, human. A warrior whose own techniques harmed them would be a chief among fools!|
47454|#821$#It is a useful attack precisely because it hurts others but is harmless to me.|
47455|#822$#Ghahaha...it is to me as your saliva is to you.
#821$#Were it harmful, I would have burned my face off long ago.|
47456|#822$#Have you happened to look at the rest of my body? Fire is what I do, young one.|
47461|What's the purpose of the horns on your head?|
47462|How do you use the horns on your head?|
47463|#821$#Mmm... Yes, they are a symbol of my virility!
#822$#Gyahaha...you really will believe about anything an Eidolon tells you.
#821$#Perhaps later I'll explain their cultural significance.|
47464|#822$#My horns are not just dashing! 
#821$#They make for a gruesome headbutt none would care to be on the receiving end of.
#822$#That's how you get a-head in life!|
47465|#821$#My horns can sense heat. Even in total darkness, they help me pinpoint an enemy's location.|
47466|#822$#Their purpose? Do you question the purpose of your own hair? It is better to simply see me in action.|
47471|Is your body temperature always so high?|
47472|Does your body temperature ever drop?|
47473|#822$#A  high body temperature is good - it means I am alive and well.|
47474|#822$#A high temperature is healthy for me.
#821$#If my temperature makes a sudden drop, my death may be close at hand.
#822$#On that day, I insist that you give me a spectacular funeral pyre.|
47475|#821$#Am I...too hot for you?
#822$#Alas, I can do little about my hotness.|
47476|#822$#Too hot already? You'd better grab some water, because things have only just begun to heat up!|
47481|What's the purpose of your tail?|
47482|What is your tail for?|
47483|#821$#Functional purpose aside, it makes me look quite dignified.
#822$#I am a handsome devil, am I not?|
47484|#821$#As you've seen, my weight is centered in my upper body.
#822$#My tail is there to provide balance, allowing me to move this heft with ease.|
47485|#821$#It's surprisingly long, which means I can crack it into enemies.
#822$#There have been times, however. Times. In which I may have...hit myself...|
47486|#821$#It is a back scratcher unequaled in this realm or the spirit realm.
#822$#Wait...you did not actually fall for my jape, did you?|
47491|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
47492|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
47493|#821$#What is there to worry about?
#822$#Wherever I go, I shall live well.|
47494|#822$#There are many things the future may hold; many desires.
#821$#Tomorrow will worry about itself; I will focus on the present.|
47495|#821$#Hah! As though you would cast me away, with all the trouble you went through to make a pact with me.
#822$#We are here together like this because we are conquerors, both of us.|
47496|#822$#Do not worry yourself for my sake. I have survived eons.
#821$#I live well, and if not, I conquer until I do.|
47601|How do you like to spend your leisure time?|
47602|How do you usually kill time?|
47603|#821$# I am the best at tracking and hunting.
#822$# My greatest hope is to defeat the creatures of evil around the world and bring peace to all.|
47604|#822$# As a knight, helping those in need is my duty.
#821$# I constantly train myself by fighting against evil.|
47605|#821$# When I have time to spare, I often travel to different cities and towns.
#823$# Future trips will be more interesting with you by my side!|
47606|#821$# My only goal is to serve you as a dutiful knight.
#823$# If there are any leisure activities that you like, I'd be happy to try them with you.|
47611|Have you ever joined any clubs?|
47612|Do you participate in any groups?|
47613|#822$# Once I was the leader of the Knights Templar.
#823$# All of our members excelled in their duties and had a strong sense of justice!|
47614|#822$# For a long time, I led the undefeatable Knights on many campaigns.
#821$# Countless evil creatures fell under our swords...|
47615|#822$# Hmm... sometimes I miss the days when I fought side by side with my fellow warriors...|
47616|#822$# Every time I join arms with you in battle, I'm reminded of those days.
#821$# There's nothing more reassuring than the mutual trust of letting someone watch your back.|
47621|Something incredible|
47622|A fantastic story.|
47623|#822$# It is said that there is a mysterious lake in a faraway land.
#821$# I've heard that someone once saw a woman's graceful arm emerge from the surface of the water.
#824$# Don't you think that's incredible?|
47624|#822$# Once I heard that there's a place in Terra called 'The Pure Land'.
#821$# Living creatures have to abandon everything to enter and obtain eternal happiness. 
#823$# What an amazing place... I'd like to see it with my own eyes.|
47625|#821$# It's rumored that beautiful fairies live in a lake surrounded by marshland and mysterious forests.
#822$# The fairies are gifted with magic and protect a legendary sacred sword.|
47626|#822$# As an Envoy of Gaia, you must have traveled to many different places, right?
#823$# Tell me something interesting in return, then.|
47631|How would you define justice?|
47632|What is justice to you?|
47633|#821$# Justice is chivalry, and chivalry is justice.
#823$# Aid for the helpless, mercy for the unfortunate - that's justice.|
47634|#824$# Justice means treating everyone equally.
#821$# Justice means helping the disadvantaged fulfill their true potential.|
47635|#822$# Justice means keeping an upright, uncorruptable heart.
#821$# Sticking to one's principles no matter what - that's the true meaning of justice.|
47636|#822$# Justice means promoting the good and punishing the bad. 
#823$# Treating everyone without discrimination is the highest form of justice - something we can all aspire to.|
47641|What should I do when facing strong enemies?|
47642|How do I deal with powerful enemies?|
47643|#821$# One should show one's true colors in battle, and fight the fight of the brave.
#823$# Only in doing so can one fulfill the honorable destiny of a knight!|
47644|#821$# Even the strongest of enemies have their weaknesses.
#823$# All you need to do is find the right strategy to beat them.|
47645|#822$# If you are pitted against enemies that exceed your ability, reply with courage and determination.
#823$# The victory always favors those who stick it out to the very end.|
47646|#822$# Retreating is also an option, when faced with overwhelming enemies.|
47651|Have you ever heard of Ventos Prairie?|
47652|What's Ventos Prairie like?|
47653|#821$# Ventos Prairie is a perfect place for hunting.
#823$# Its open fields and flat terrain can be crossed at a swift gallop.|
47654|#821$# Apart from the Makars, who have been living there for generations,
#822$# a group of cunning Gnomes have also made it their home.|
47655|#822$# Not far from the Makar Tribe, there's a network of underground caves.
#821$# There lies the flame-drenched Infernal Abyss created by Zaahir.|
47656|#822$# Ventos Prairie... it's a beautiful place that reminds me of my homeland...|
47661|What do you think of Terra?|
47662|What can you tell me about Terra?|
47663|#821$# Not everyone in Terra is kind... but there are a great number of helpful people.
#822$# Humans as a whole aren't such a bad lot.|
47664|#821$# There're a lot of places in Terra that haven't been discovered by humans.
#821$# Those places will be the key to unlocking the secret of the Cube of Gaia.|
47665|#821$# Because of the shackles of time placed on Terra by the Cube of Gaia,
#822$# all living things have to face the ravages of illness and death.
#823$# But it's precisely because of mortality that numerous cultures can coexist in Terra.|
47666|#822$# Terra was created by the Cube of Gaia.
#821$# Aside from Terra, there are also the Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium.|
47671|What's the Mirabelle Group?|
47672|Have you heard of the Mirabelle Group?|
47673|#822$# The Mirabelle Group was founded a group of just and charitable explorers.
#821$# Their mission is to help anyone in need.
#823$# As a group, they share much in common with my code of chilvary.|
47674|#821$# The Mirabelle Group has branches in every village.
#822$# You can find out who is in need simply by looking at the Mirabelle Bulletin Board.|
47675|#821$# You can accept all kinds of quests from Mirrabelle Bulletin Board.
#823$# A splendid reward is given to those who help complete these quests.|
47676|#822$# The Mirabelle Group seems to be a very resourceful organization.
#821$# Judging from the number of quests they post every day, they must also have a huge membership.|
47681|Tell me about Guild Instances.|
47682|What do you know about Guild Instances?|
47683|#821$# As more and more evil creatures began to appear on Midgard,
#822$# The Church issued an order that all guilds take up arms.|
47684|#822$# Your Guild must reach Level 4 to participate in Guild Instances.
#821$# You can register through the Guild Interface.|
47685|#821$# Personal contribution points can be accumulated by completing Guild Instances.
#823$# Rare loot can be obtained by those who accumulate enough contribution points.|
47686|#821$# More and more Guilds are participating Guild Instances.
#822$# You should consider joining a bigger Guild. The more members there are, the easier it is.|
47691|What's the Sky Tower like?|
47692|Have you heard of the Sky Tower?|
47693|#821$# The Sky Tower is the central landmark of Navea.
#822$# It is said that all kinds of rare treasures are stored at the top of the tower.|
47694|#822$# The Holy Spirit Potion is the first thing people think of when the Sky Tower is mentioned.
#821$# Rumor has it that the Holy Spirit Potion cures all illnesses; some people even say that it can bring the dead back to life.|
47695|#821$# The Sky Tower is under the strict control of the church. It is crawling with legends and secrets. 
#822$# What on earth could it have been built for? It's such a fascinating place!|
47696|#821$# The entrance to Sky Tower is normally sealed by an impenetrable magic seal.
#822$# The seal will only be removed at a preordained time, allowing the selected Envoy of Gaia to enter.|
47701|What is chivalry?|
47702|How does one become a real knight?|
47703|#822$# Self-discipline is the key premise of becoming a knight.
#821$# A knight does not fight without a meaningful reason.|
47704|#821$# Knights are honorable and chivalrous toward ladies.
#822$# Learning how to help a lady in distress resolve her problem is the very first lesson for every knight.|
47705|#821$# True chivalry cannot be defined in a few words.
#822$# A dutiful knight must watch his behavior and live by his word.|
47706|#822$# Nothing can keep you from becoming a knight. All you need is a merciful heart.|
47711|Did you receive any guidance from others?|
47712|How did you become so wise?|
47713|#824$# Heh, heh... I was once reckless and impulsive, too.
#822$# Fortunately, I received many lessons from an elder, who was well-versed in magic.|
47714|#821$# The one who taught me the real meaning of chivalry was an elder who treated me like a family member.
#822$# He saved me from danger many times.|
47715|#824$# Sigh... I wonder where he is now...|
47716|#821$# My teacher was a very famous old mage.
#822$# It's said he had demon blood coursing through his veins, allowing him to use all kinds of magic.|
47721|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
47722|What makes your weapon special?|
47723|#821$# My weapon is called Sword in the Stone. It represents justice.|
47724|#821$# Sword in the Stone can make short work of any evil or obstacles in my way.
#824$# If, however, it is not used for just ends, the sword will immediately break in two.|
47725|#822$# The Sword in the Stone was not originally of this world.
#821$# It only arrived here after the Cube of Gaia created Terra.|
47726|#821$# The Sword in the Stone was once firmly inlaid in the Cube of Gaia.
#823$# When I extracted it from the cube, I gave it its name.|
47731|Do you normally sit down to rest?|
47732|Do you sit down when you're tired?|
47733|#822$# As a knight, it's essential to be courteous.
#821$# So I always stand, even when I'm exhausted.|
47734|#822$# A knight must be vigiliant.
#821$# I even sleep standing up!|
47735|#822$# I don't need to sit down to rest.
#823$# The strength of my resolve in protecting my companions is enough to keep me upright!|
47736|#822$# A knight like me doesn't need to sit down to take a break.
#822$# You've been taking longer breaks recently... are you a bit overworked?|
47741|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
47742|I want to hear gossip about the other Eidolons.|
47743|#822$# I heard that Kusanagi's true form is a sword.
#824$# Perhaps... perhaps she could communicate with the Sword in the Stone...|
47744|#821$# Serif is the one I like the best. He understands the true meaning of chivalry.
#822$# He keeps a respectful distance from both Endora and Merrilee.|
47745|#821$# Bealdor's Claymore emits a pale light with even the gentlest of movements. 
#822$# Well... my Sword in the Stone will have to concede to him... on this point...|
47746|#822$# Nazrudin is modest and erudite.
#824$# He never fails to remind me of my own teacher.|
47751|Are there any wishes you would like to see fulfilled?|
47752|What do you desire most?|
47753|#822$# My wish is to fulfill your wishes.
#823$# My wish is to serve you well as a knight possibly can.|
47754|#821$# I've heard that many places in Terra are still suffering from the invasion of monsters.
#822$# One of my wishes is to eliminate those evil creatures so people can live in peace.|
47755|#822$# It is said that an artifact called Holy Grail exists in Terra. Supposedly, it can bring peace and happiness to the world...
#824$# If I could find it... I'd be able to help even more people.|
47756|#823$# My wish is to help as many people as I can.|
47761|Do you have friends you really trust?|
47762|Who do you trust the most?|
47763|#821$# You, of course!
#823$# I am proud to fight by your side!|
47764|#821$# Once I was part of a group of reliable knights.
#822$# Even today, I fondly recall the days we spent traveling the world, fighting for justice.|
47765|#821$# Once upon a time, I was one of the knights of justice.
#823$# We endured countless trials together.|
47766|#823$# A knight learns to place all his trust in his friends!
#821$# He who hopes to find true friendship must learn to place his trust in others.|
47771|Are you really a lord of the Round Table?|
47772|Are you really a lord?|
47773|#822$# Heh, heh... my comrades-in-arms call me "lord".|
47774|#821$# Indeed, all the members of the my group used to call me "lord" when I was their commander...
#824$# The title stuck, and many call me "lord" to this day.|
47775|#822$# There was an interesting story about the Sword in the Stone:
#821$# "The one who can extract it from Cube of Gaia will become a lord."
#824$# The title stuck, and many call me "lord" to this day.|
47776|#822$# Maybe I was once a lord who led many knights.
#823$# However, now I am just a knight who wants to fulfill your wishes.|
47781|How do you train yourself normally?|
47782|What's your training regimen?|
47783|#822$# Apart from practicing my sword technique, I often look for those who need my aid.
#821$# Implementing chivalry in every part of one's life is the best way to train oneself.|
47784|#821$# Chivalry is a good training method unto itself.
#822$# Doing everything, every day, with a merciful and righteous heart: that is how I train myself.|
47785|#822$# The path of justice is not easy.
#823$# However, as a knight, every step I took was a part of my training.|
47786|#822$# Why, are you also interested in self-improvement?
#823$# How about a practice battle with me?|
47791|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
47792|What's your plan after we part ways?|
47793|#824$# If one day we must separate... I'll continue on my path of justice.|
47794|#822$# It's always fine if you want to select another path.
#823$# All the adventures we've experienced won't be forgotten.|
47795|#822$# A knight doesn't feel bad about parting ways.
#823$# It's a necessary step for our eventual reunion!|
47796|#823$# I'll travel around and see everything the world has to offer.|
47901|Is there any food that you especially like?|
47902|What's your favorite food?|
47903|#822$#Mmm... I'll never say no to inarizushi and fried tofu. Let's have some!|
47904|#821$#And what better way to wash down my inarizushi than with a hot bottle of sake?|
47905|#821$#Well, you look like a pretty tasty meal yourself!
#823$#Oh dear, did you just flinch? Haha, you're so precious.|
47906|#822$#If it's something you like, I can learn to like it too.|
47911|What's your favorite season?|
47912|Do like any particular season most?|
47913|#822$#I'll tell you what I don't like - summers!
#824$#I get so hot and sweaty, I just want to stay indoors all day.|
47914|#821$#Winter is my favorite.
#822$#On a cold winter day, I can snuggle up in a blanket with a bottle of boo- er, hot chocolate!|
47915|#822$#Well, as long as it's not summer, I enjoy all the seasons.
#821$#But being sweaty is really the worst.|
47916|#821$#Autumn has a certain elegance to it.
#822$#Sometimes, it just seems like food tastes more flavorful in the fall.|
47921|Do you like animals?|
47922|What do you think of animals?|
47923|#821$#What could be more adorable than soft, furry fox kits?|
47924|#824$#Lamest animal? Dogs, of course. The way they fawn over humans; it's so embarrassing.
#824$#It's hard to believe we noble foxes are distantly related to those canines!|
47925|#821$#I like foxes the most...but I may be biased.
#822$#What about you? Are you a fox fancier like me?|
47926|#821$#Little fox kits are just the cutest!
#822$#Their little soft, furry bodies all curled up in a den...it almost makes me want to have kits of my own someday.|
47931|What do I do when I run into a strong enemy?|
47932|Tell me the best strategy for facing a powerful enemy.|
47933|#822$#You will bravely face the enemy, while I go hide behind a rock!
#823$#Oh, c'mon, I was only kidding!
#821$#I'd never leave you behind, you know.|
47934|#824$#Hmm...that's a toughie.
#822$#What do you think? Maybe a dash of trickery?|
47935|#822$#I'm all in favor of a two-pronged attack.
#821$#You hit 'em in the front, and I'll zap 'em from behind!|
47936|#822$#What if I swooned during the fight? Would you dash in bravely to save me?|
47941|What kind of person do you like?|
47942|What kind of person would you want to date?|
47943|#823$# Oh gosh, way to ask something embarrassing! I thought you already knew.
#821$#The kind of person I like is...well...someone like you.|
47944|#823$#Ohmygosh. My mind just went blank.|
47945|#824$#Why would you ask something like that?
#824$#Don't you realize? You're the one I like most.|
47946|#821$#My ideal date would have awesome skills, good looks, and most importantly, they can't let me go hungry.
#822$#Haha, you say I'm being too picky and I'll never find anyone like that?
#821$#Don't YOU meet all those conditions?|
47951|What's special about Port Skandia?|
47952|Can you tell me about Port Skandia?|
47953|#822$#Eh? Isn't Port Skandia your hometown? What would I know about it that you don't?
#824$#Are you teasing me again?|
47954|#822$#It seems like a quiet little town, but Port Skandia must be a nice place.
#821$#You grew up there, and you turned into a pretty good human, if I say so myself.|
47955|#822$#There's a beautiful lighthouse in Port Skandia where you can look far off toward the horizon.
#823$#Next time we're there, let's go see the sun setting on the sea.|
47956|#822$#How long has it been since you've been back to Port Skandia, anyway?
#821$#Maybe you should go back more often, if you have to ask Eidolons what's happening in your hometown.|
47961|What do you know of the Aura Kingdom?|
47962|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
47963|#822$#The spirits who come from there say the Aura Kingdom's beauty far outshines the most picturesque vistas of Terra.
#821$#It's known as a realm filled with unending joy and peace.|
47964|#823$#I've never been there myself, but I like to think  you can take a little bit of heaven with you by keeping a positive attitude.|
47965|#821$#They say time functions much differently in the Aura Kingdom. It passes very slowly there, and nothing ages.
#822$#It sounds pretty profound, like contemplating my rock garden!|
47966|#821$#Sometimes Uzuriel or Abraxas will tell me about the Aura Kingdom, but I've never been there before.
#822$#If you go there someday, be sure to take me with you!|
47971|I want to know more about Masteries.|
47972|What do you know about Mastery?|
47973|#822$#Masteries strengthen skills you have, or give them additional abilities.
#821$#They're like the frosting on the cake of battle techniques!|
47974|#822$#In Navea, there's a group who can teach Envoys the secrets of Mastery.
#821$#If you can collect these special tokens, you can exchange them for advanced training in your Masteries.|
47975|#822$#Mastery? Boooo-ring. Let's talk about how I can break into the Terran scene as an idol singer!|
47976|#822$#I've heard that only those people with an excellent command of the original skill can really grasp the key to Mastery.
#821$#You're a good fighter, right? It shouldn't be any problem for you.|
47981|Is it true that every region has unique culinary specialties?|
47982|I heard that every region has its own famous dish.|
47983|#822$#We're talking about food now? Are you hungry?|
47984|#821$#If you DO happen to take a world food tour, I'm the #1 choice to accompany you, right?
#824$#I have hands that can hold tableware, and not every Eidolon can say that!|
47985|#821$#If you're looking to try good regional cuisine, I recommend going to the street vendors.
#823$#Or, I could prepare them for you personally! That kitchen fire last time was just a freak incident.|
47986|#822$#Can we go somewhere where the regional specialties include inarizushi and fried tofu?
#821$#Next time we're sightseeing, I'll be on the lookout for those!|
47991|How can we find the magic in everyday life?|
47992|What's interesting out there in the world?|
47993|#824$#A...are you saying every day with me isn't magical?
#824$#*sniff* I've tried so hard...|
47994|#821$#I have no doubt that we'll make something interesting happen wherever we turn up!|
47995|#822$#If we pay attention to others and help them out, the richness of their lives will enrich ours.
#821$#Also, y'know, when we help people, that might be a quest! And quest-givers tend to give rewards.|
47996|#821$#It's really interesting to listen to people's conversations. You can feel like you're experiencing a little sliver of their lives.
#822$#Of course, if you dig up something really scandalous, be sure to tell me first!|
48001|Why do you like inarizushi and fried tofu so much?|
48002|Are inarizushi and fried tofu really that delicious?|
48003|#821$#Y'know...I don't know why. 
#822$#As far back as I can remember, I've always thought they were delicious.|
48004|#822$#Don't you like inarizushi and fried tofu?
#824$#If you don't like them...well, there's no accounting for taste. You can eat your "ham bargars" and I'll have my tofu.|
48005|#822$#I think it's because people often made offerings of inarizushi and fried tofu to me when I was just a guardian spirit.
#821$#I guess I got so used to eating them that now they're like my comfort food.|
48006|#822$#They really are delicious - I'll make you try them one of these days.
#821$#...now that you got me talking about them, I'm totally hungry.|
48011|Your ears are so cute...can I touch them?|
48012|Can I...touch your ears?|
48013|#822$# I've never allowed anyone to touch my ears! 
#821$#It's...it's only because you're my Envoy that I'll allow you to touch them.|
48014|#822$#W-what kind of question is that?!
#823$#Right here? Right out in the open? It'd be indecent.|
48015|#821$#Normally I'd shoot down anyone who asked, but for you...I guess I'll acquiesce - but just this once!|
48016|#821$#If you really have your heart set on touching them, I suppose I'll allow it.
#822$#But you can only touch them for a moment! Any longer and I'd start to feel embarrassed.|
48021|Do you know Tsubaki?|
48022|I heard that you're related to Tsubaki.|
48023|#821$#Hmm? Who's that?
#822$#I have no idea what you're talking about. *wink*|
48024|#821$#Ohhhhh, Tsubaki?
#822$#Never heard of her... tee-hee...|
48025|#822$#Is she a new friend of yours?
#821$#She sounds adorable...maybe second to me.|
48026|#821$#Welllll, the name sounds familiar, now that I think about it.
#822$#I think I've heard of her somewhere before, but I just don't know where. *snicker*|
48031|What's your real fox self like?|
48032|You're really a nine-tailed fox, right?|
48033|#822$#Why the sudden interest in foxes?
#821$#Don't you like the way I look now?|
48034|#822$#To tell the truth, no one alive has seen my fox form.
#821$#Those who did kinda got turned into a little snack, you dig?|
48035|#822$#The number of tails a fox has represents the amount of magical power they possess. I have nine tails, and you've seen my magic!|
48036|#822$#My real form is an enormous, golden nine-tailed fox.
#821$#Hee hee...is it hard to think of me like that?|
48041|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
48042|Dish me up some real dirt on the other Eidolons!|
48043|#821$#I've heard Yarnaros can fly faster than the speed of sound.
#822$#If he yells something as he flies, does it only catch up to him later?|
48044|#822$#Sigrun is really cool.
#821$#Even on hot days, she's never without her full suit of armor. That's professional dedication right there!|
48045|#822$#Aelius has many talents you wouldn't expect someone like him to have - like music!
#822$#But he always gives me a weird vibe, covering up his face like that. What has he got to hide?|
48046|#821$#Bel-Chandra does a beautiful, mesmerizing dance that totally locks your eyes on her.
#822$#Maybe I should get some tips from her, then try out my new dance on you.|
48051|Is nine tails the most a fox can have?|
48052|How many tails can you get?|
48053|#822$#Oh, looks like you've done your homework.
#821$#I got all nine of my tails before I became an Eidolon.|
48054|#822$#You reeeeally want to know? Well...I'm not gonna tell you.
#821$#We ladies have to keep a few good secrets, right?|
48055|#822$#Mmm, that's right.
#821$#Care to guess how many tails I have?
#822$#This is to see if you've been paying attention!|
48056|#822$#Can a fox wear a fake tail? You can take a guess...
#821$#...but if you're wrong, I'll zap you!|
48061|Where's your tail, anyway?|
48062|Why can't I see your tail?|
48063|#821$#Teehee... I've hidden it away.
#823$#If I have it out, I feel like everyone just stares at my butt.|
48064|#822$#Oh? You want to see my tail?
#821$#Well...I can't let you see it right now. It might count as flashing if I showed you in public.|
48065|#821$#Only smart people can see my tail, mwahahaha!|
48066|#822$#A fox never exposes their tail when transformed.
#821$#That would totally give us away when we play pranks on others.|
48071|Isn't it hard to walk in such high heels?|
48072|Do you get tired walking with those high heels?|
48073|#822$#No one said being a fashionable fighter is easy, you know.
#821$#But if you think I look nice, I'll take the compliment.|
48074|#822$#Haha! You should pay a little more attention.
#821$#Most of the time, I'm floating, so it doesn't bother me at all.|
48075|#821$#It doesn't tire me out at all, but it's sweet of you to be concerned.|
48076|#821$#Aren't these shoes great? They're my favorite pair.|
48081|What's the blue jewel around your neck?|
48082|Can you tell me about that blue ornament you wear?|
48083|#822$#I use this crystal to store energy. It helps me manifest easily in your realm.|
48084|#823$#Ahem...my eyes are up here.|
48085|#822$#This crystal was a gift from the Cube of Gaia. All Eidolons have something like this. Do you want a matching pendant?|
48086|#822$#Why don't you make a guess as to what it does?
#821$#If you're right, I'll give you a reward.|
48091|Have you thought about your life when we're no longer together?|
48092|What do you plan to do after we part ways?|
48093|#822$#When we go our separate ways?
#824$#*sniff* Are...are you tired of me?|
48094|#822$#Part ways? What are you talking about?
#824$#Haven't I been your #1, best, prettiest Eidolon?|
48095|#824$#Until the day you say you don't want me, I won't leave your side.
#821$#But that day will never come, right?|
48096|#822$#I don't want to talk about that. Just thinking about it hits me with the depression stick.|
48201|Is there anything that's troubling you?|
48202|What gives you the biggest headache?|
48203|#821$# Troubling stuff? Why would someone like me have any troubles? 
#821$# But if I were to be truthful...
#823$# It would be that I'm too popular with women, which can cause real trouble, ha ha.|
48204|#824$# Sigh, why is a cat like me so perfect? 
#822$# You mere mortals are destined to indulge yourselves in my incomparable charm forever. 
#823$# This can be a real bother...|
48205|#821$# I think you might not be able to understand...
#824$# However, when you are always invincible, in battle or love, the lack of challenge can be pretty boring!|
48206|#822$# Heh heh, don't lie to yourself, your eyes have betrayed you...
#824$# One more captive, who can't resist my charm... Is being beautiful a mistake, too?|
48211|What is your favorite food?|
48212|What do you normally eat?|
48213|#822$# Hey, I'm not a tame kitty... Don't ever think of patronizing me with things like grilled fish.|
48214|#822$# I'm a cat who loves his meat, I think you can easily see that. 
#823$# What I like, of course, is to take huge bites of meat in luxury!|
48215|#821$# I only eat the freshest, thick cut steaks, with no seasoning at all. 
#822$# They are tightly wrapped in coals of high temperature, which completely char the surfaces in an instant, locking the juices.   
#823$# When you finally tear it open with your mouth, it's like conquering virgin territories! Such a joyous feeling!|
48216|#822$# A player as sentimental and affectionate as me certainly can't go without romance for a day. 
#823$# Encounters with beautiful women, all around the world, are the sweetest food!|
48221|What do you think honor is?|
48222|What does honor mean to you?|
48223|#821$# Honor is the most important thing in the world; it's a truth that you should protect with your life. 
#824$# That's because if a person doesn't protect his honor, he certainly can't be trusted to take responsibility for himself, either.|
48224|#822$# Honor? It's an invisible medal that you put on your coat. 
#823$# You can only get other people to worship you if you have these medals, just like me!|
48225|#822$# Honor is a necessary weapon for realizing your own ambitions; 
#821$# it can turn your enemies into friends, and your disadvantaged position into an advantageous one!|
48226|#821$# It's like how birds cherish their feathers and how beasts cherish their fur. 
#823$# For a cat like me, honor is my most magnificent coat - Its brilliance must be maintained at all times!|
48231|What do you think is admirable?|
48232|What kind of people are considered admirable?|
48233|#823$# Hehe, what are you trying to hint at? A cat like me will definitely take your compliments with pleasure!|
48234|#821$# An obstinate adherence to the good in your goals, as well as being forthright and generous in how you handle things - these are the basic criteria to being admirable. 
#823$# However, I don't think anyone in this world can be as admirable as me, haha.|
48235|#822$# People who are really admirable do not need any tricks to embellish themselves; 
#823$# they can mesmerize people just by breathing. Just like me!|
48236|#822$# What is admirable? Heh heh, isn't this a very simple question? 
#823$# As long as you continue to stay by my side, you will very quickly understand the real meaning of "admirable."|
48241|What type of girls are you into?|
48242|What type of girl are you attracted to?|
48243|#823$# A woman who's pretty like a flower and passionate like fire is my natural favorite, hehe!|
48244|#822$# Haughty, rich young ladies who dare to shower me with affection, like I'm a kitten are not bad either; 
#823$# they are like flowers that bloom generously on the highlands - valuable conquests!|
48245|#821$# Graceful beauties who have both intellect and beauty are most elusive. 
#823$# Having a passionate battle of wits with them is... Heh heh, just thinking of it get me excited.|
48246|#822$# As long as you display confidence and respect yourself, you'll be show yourself at your most attractive. 
#823$# Women that match these criteria are the most charming, in my heart.|
48251|What's special about Candeo Marsh?|
48252|Can you give a brief introduction Candeo Marsh?|
48253|#822$# There's a vicious Bandit Gang formed by Werewolves in Candeo Marsh; 
#823$# if I were in charge of that place, I'll definitely not let them wreck havoc!|
48254|#821$# It's said that a tribe of Sarpa has been living in the underground waterways of Candeo Marsh since ancient times. 
#822$# Even though I don't really like damp and slippery water banks, I do hope to see these snake-people.|
48255|#821$# Even though there have been rumors about terrifying blood-sucking creatures lurking in Candeo Marsh, 
#824$# a cat like me doesn't believe in such superstition, there must be some secret behind this.|
48256|#821$# Candeo Marsh is a dark and damp place; I don't really want to go near there.|
48261|Please tell me about monsters.|
48262|What should I take note of, when fighting monsters.|
48263|#822$# When you are surrounded by difficult monsters, escape as fast as you can; they'll give up as long as you've gotten a certain distance away from them. 
#821$# Of course, a cat like me would never run away, ha ha.|
48264|#821$# Some monsters are very good at camouflage, so open your eyes wide, and be careful when you are walking about in the wilderness.|
48265|#821$# Do not be too hasty to attack monsters upon first meeting. 
#822$# You should click and select the Monster Info Interface first, to get an idea of your opponent's skills and its monster drops, to get the upper hand.|
48266|#821$# The habits of monsters are ever-changing, you'll never be able to predict their abilities. 
#822$# Even if some monsters look very similar, they might still have completely different characteristics.|
48271|I'd like to know about casting and forging.|
48272|How can I forge and cast Enchanted Equipment.|
48273|#821$# Heh heh, forging and casting is the best way that mere mortals can obtain Enchanted Equipment. 
#823$# As long as you persist in your effort, you'll be able to make the highest quality equipment!|
48274|#822$# Heh heh, let me divulge an absolutely critical piece of information to you: 
#823$# the higher the quality of the materials you use to cast, the higher the possibility of getting the best results!|
48275|#821$# As long as you've learnt the formula, you can then look for blacksmiths of Navea to forge and cast.
#822$# Equipment that's cast and forged is very useful!|
48276|#822$# The army under me consists of over ten thousand people, and I have hundreds of blacksmiths under me, too. 
#824$# However, none of them has workmanship that's comparable to Analisa of the Templars...|
48281|I would like to know about allocating character points.|
48282|Give me some tips on character point allocation.|
48283|#822$# Character points can be divided into attack and defense points, and will increase as you advance in level. 
#821$# As long as you've opened the Character Info Interface, you'll be able to allocate the points according to your preferences.|
48284|#821$#Certain attributes have an upper limit; for example, the upper limit of speed attribute is 50%.
#822$#Therefore, please verify your equipment and skills bonus carefully first before allocating points.
#823$#Otherwise, don't blame me for not having reminded you, haha.|
48285|#821$# Character point allocation will greatly affect your fighting ability, therefore you have to allocate carefully, before a battle.|
48286|#821$# Heh heh, if I were to help you in your allocation, I'll definitely allocate all of them to HP. 
#824$# Otherwise, how would you be able to fight enemies, considering what a weak constitution you have.|
48291|What's the function of the Community System?|
48292|I wanna know tips about the Community System.|
48293|#822$# Heh heh, you can set lots of information on your Personal Profile, including your interests and hobbies. 
#821$# Go try to share it with your good friends.|
48294|#821$# You can get loyalty points after greeting good friends online everyday, 
#821$# and exchange them for items in the Item Mall when you've accumulated enough of them - it's killing two birds with one stone. Ha ha.|
48295|#821$# You can speedily connect with your good friends, or form parties, though the Community System.
#824$# I don't want to admit this, but even my army isn't able to exchange information so speedily...|
48296|#823$# Get to know more friends during your journey. I think that will definitely be of help to you.|
48301|What's the demeanor of a gentleman?|
48302|How do I become a gentleman?|
48303|#821$# You must treat a lady with impeccable manners and look your best, 
#823$# in order to have the bearing that a qualified gentleman should have.|
48304|#822$# You don't just speak well, to have a gentleman's demeanor, 
#821$# you must also put words into action by always treating the lady with respect, just as I do.|
48305|#821$# To be a true gentleman, one must be cultured and filled with knowledge; 
#823$# of course, if he has excellent combat abilities - like me - that will be even more perfect.|
48306|#821$# To become a gentleman, one must be exposed to art and culture for a long period of time; it's not something that you can do overnight.|
48311|Can I touch your tail?|
48312|Your tail looks like it would be nice to touch.|
48313|#823$# Are you kidding me? I'm a great cat, why would I let you touch my tail?|
48314|#823$# I never let anyone touch my tail! 
#824$# Are you taking me for a house cat?|
48315|#821$# I've only let a cute young lady touchd my tail before; 
#824$# hers was such an innocent and naive request - how could I bear to reject her?|
48316|#822$# What a bold and rude request! 
#823$# How dare you ask a cat like me such a question? You've got to prepare yourself for this!|
48321|How did you get your alias?|
48322|Why does everyone call you Emperor?|
48323|#821$# I got my alias, "Emperor," naturally, due to the army of cats that I command, of course. 
#823$# As everyone is in awe of my capability, they gave me this title, ha ha.|
48324|#821$# The title "Emperor" is used for me, by people that I'm not familiar with.  
#822$# Only people that I really trust can call me by my name. Of course, that includes you.|
48325|#821$# When you have superior capabilities, this world will of course submit to you in awe. 
#822$# They do that, and give you a title, to remind themselves that this person is extraordinary. 
#823$# In this way, these people put their egos aside, and follow your commands.|
48326|#823$# My alias, "Emperor," is certainly the best title that I've won with my glorious victories!|
48331|Is there any secret to wooing the opposite sex?|
48332|Can you teach me how to woo the opposite sex?|
48333|#823$# The secret to wooing the opposite sex? Haha, I think you've got your emphasis wrong. 
#821$# The emphasis should always be on whether you're a person of value, and that will attract the other person.|
48334|#823$# You've found the right person to ask this, I'm an expert in this area. 
#821$# Try to cater to the other's likes. Start with the topics that the other person is interested in, so as to close up the gap between you and them.|
48335|#824$# Don't be discouraged if the other person doesn't want you, or do something to hurt the other person. 
#821$# Be generous, mature and face it with a smile; being friends is a great option too, isn't it?|
48336|#822$# Even though I'm suave and romantic, I'm very serious when it comes to women. 
#821$# As long as you're sincere, the other person will slowly come to appreciate your sincerity.|
48341|I wanna know some gossip of other Eidolons.|
48342|Tell me some interesting tidbits about the Eidolons.|
48343|#821$# Gigas is a warrior with mighty strength. Word has it that he once fulfilled twelve difficult quests. 
#823$# However, I'll put him under my control one day and take him in my army, ha ha.|
48344|#822$# Hmmph, according to what I observe, Uzuiel is a deeply shrewd Eidolon. 
#821$# Also... she seems to be always covering something with her behavior....   
#823$# She was never just a simple nobody in the past, so you gotta beware of her!|
48345|#821$# Quelkulan is an ally who's good at both attack and defense; he can hurt and save people with his venom. 
#824$# It's a pity that he's rather eccentric, so a generous and gracious cat like me can't really get along with him.|
48346|#823$# Hahaha! Talking about Bahadur makes me want to fight so much! 
#822$# The underground army that he leads is rather secretive - they've never confronted me directly. 
#823$# If there's a chance... No, I must have 300 rounds of battle with him, before I'd call it quits!|
48351|Have you lost a battle before?|
48352|Do you have much experience with losing?|
48353|#822$# How could a warrior like me lose a battle? Even if I retreat, it's just a tactical trick!|
48354|#824$# Looks like you don't really know how the world works, let me share with you famous words. 
#822$# I come, I see, I conquer. 
#823$# Bear this in mind; this is my only and constant way, ha ha ha.|
48355|#823$# Ha ha ha, I'll never fight a losing battle!|
48356|#822$# When I was on an expedition to a kingdom in the desert once, I met a...
#824$# No... That wasn't a failure! It's just that I have not conquered... Yet!|
48361|Will you be happy if I rub your belly?|
48362|Do you like to be caressed on the belly?|
48363|#822$# Shut, shut up... Stop saying that...
#824$# Just mentioning the word "belly" makes me itch all over!|
48364|#823$# Oh my god, please do not mention the word "belly" again, it makes me itch all over!|
48365|#824$# Where do you get such a horrifying idea?! Is caressing a furry belly so pleasurable?|
48366|#822$# Please do not derive pleasure from another's pain...
#824$# I'm not a kitten, so please do not think of touching my stomach all day long...|
48371|Who's your biggest enemy?|
48372|Who's your strongest foe?|
48373|#822$# Whoever dares to block my way will be trampled! 
#823$# Ha ha, who'll dare oppose me still after hearing this?|
48374|#824$# Looking at the line of graves behind me,
#822$# what foe would dare to stand against me?|
48375|#821$# If there's really someone like this, I'd like to call on them personally, ha ha!|
48376|#824$# Other than that woman... Hmmph. I'll subdue her, sooner or later!|
48381|What constitutes your empire?|
48382|What are your goals?|
48383|#821$# Heh heh, the goals I pursue are not things that ordinary people can easily understand...|
48384|#824$# A lot of people misunderstand me. They think that I'm a fool, that I only go after power and desires. 
#821$# Actually, these are extras that come in the process of establishing my empire. 
#822$# As long as I can reach my goal, I don't really care if I have power or not.|
48385|#823$# The empire that I would build is a kingdom larger than any before, 
#821$# one that allows all creatures to live, free of evil, as nature dictates!|
48386|#821$# One must be a great cat before he can accomplish something big. 
#822$# You can see that even as a feline emperor, I haven't yet realized my dreams; 
#823$# which is to say that my empire is an enormous plan, ha ha ha!|
48391|If the time to say goodbye should come, what what will you do after that?|
48392|What are your plans for if we ever have to part ways?|
48393|#823$# Ha ha ha, do you think you'll be able to escape from me, at some point? 
#821$# Looks like you've not come to as deep an understanding of the world as I'd hoped.|
48394|#822$# Don't worry, my information network pretty much covers everything. 
#821$# Therefore, even if I go away, for a time, your will still be in my grasp.|
48395|#822$# Saying goodbye is part of life, so don't be sad over it. 
#823$# Look at the big picture. When you can see the whole world, we'll meet again.|
48396|#821$# I'll continue my conquests after we go our separate ways, and build the greatest empire in history.|
48501|How do you manage your anger?|
48502|What do you do to resolve your anger?|
48503|#823$# Ha! There's no need to manage anger. During times like this, it's best to fight it out!|
48504|#822$# You have to find a way to vent your anger, of course. 
#823$# I think the best way to relax is to immerse yourself in combat.|
48505|#821$# When you're angry, you must find a way to release it. 
#824$# You'll become sick if you hold such strong emotion inside!|
48506|#822$# Even if you're going to explode, you can't vent your anger on just any person you find. 
#821$# Think carefully about the reasons for your anger, and its proper target.|
48511|What do you think discipline is?|
48512|According to you, what's discipline?|
48513|#822$# Discipline is necessary for the maintenance of any organization. 
#823$# Governed by steely discipline, the organization will definitely have great power!|
48514|#821$# Discipline protects the rights of the public. 
#822# The will of the people must be carried out smoothly. 
#824$# It's sometimes necessary to make hard sacrifices!|
48515|#823$# Being able to accomplish any order of the leader!  
#821$# This is my ideal sort of discipline!|
48516|#823$# Ha ha ha, my orders define the only discipline!|
48521|What do you think a team is?|
48522|According to you, what makes a team?|
48523|#822$# What? Team? 
#823$# What you probably mean, is a group of my loyal subordinates. Ha!|
48524|#824$# I usually fight by myself. I don't need a team.|
48525|#821$# Teams are just games for children. 
#823$# Capable people do not need teams at all!|
48526|#821$# With my invincible power, I'll be able to defeat all enemies in my way. 
#822$# Things like teams will only slow me down.|
48531|Do you like to talk to people?|
48532|Do you usually chat with people?|
48533|#822$# I'm a lone wolf, I never talk to people!|
48534|#821$# Do I look like someone who likes to "chat?"|
48535|#822$# I don't usually chat with people.
#821$# Why waste time doing that, when I could be strengthening my skills?|
48536|#823$# I don't need to talk to people; they should just follow my orders!|
48541|What's the thing that shocked you most?|
48542|What left you with the deepest impression?|
48543|#821$# When I led my troops galloping across the land for the first time, the mortals in the area were shocked to death.
#823$# Heh, that was only one of the things in my life that worth bragging about!|
48544|#823$#I've been through so much that nothing surprises me anymore!|
48545|#822$#Not too many things have shocked me, in my long lifetime.
#824$# However, when I first entered the Underground Labyrinth, its deep darkness really took me aback.|
48546|#821$# Ha! When I first saw you, you actually caught my attention.
#823$# Looks like you are a diamond in the rough - fulfill your potential, and don't disappoint me!|
48551|What's special about the Star Sand Desert?|
48552|Can you please give an overview of Star Sand Desert?|
48553|#822$# Star Sand Desert is full of dust and sand, and looks very wild. 
#823$# Every time I'm galloping in a wasteland, I'll always think of this place.|
48554|#822$# The world's biggest Trading Guild can be found in Star Sand Desert.  
#821$# It's said, to make business travelling more convenient, they often pay high wages for mercenaries. 
#823$# Ha! This might be a great chance for you to make money!|
48555|#821$# Why? I'm a warrior, not a tour guide!|
48556|#821$# There are Ancient Ruins, sealed by a mysterious power, in the Star Sand Desert. 
#822$# It's said that uncountable Secret Treasures are buried deep within the Ruins, and their value is enough to buy a whole kingdom.|
48561|What is Eidolon Energy?|
48562|What do you know about Eidolon Energy?|
48563|#821$# Eidolon Energy comes from the Cube of Gaia, and flows throughout the world.|
48564|#824$# How much must I teach you? Have you no general knowledge at all?
#821$# Listen, Eidolon Energy is the same power that flows from the Cube of Gaia.
#823$# After you've collected a certain amount, the altar will resonate with power, calling out to the Eidolons!|
48565|#822$# Eidolon Energy can be put into any of the ruined Eidolon Altars, awakening an Eidolon.
#821$# Awakening Eidolons enables you to fight with them, as long as sufficient power is accumulated within a short time!|
48566|#822$#  You can only get Eidolon Energy in a place where it's been gathered, like a dungeon.
#823$# Try to defeat the monsters in the dungeon - you will definitely not be disappointed!|
48571|I would like to know about skills.|
48572|Please tell me about skills.|
48573|#822$# Monsters will be temporarily resistant to the negative status inflicted by your skills, after recovering.
#821$# For example, when a monster removes a Stunned Status, there will be a short time when you can't stun them again. 
#823$# Keep this in mind!|
48574|#821$# Some monsters' skills are limited in direction and scope. 
#823$# So if you take note of effects on the ground, and avoid accordingly, it will help you greatly in battle!|
48575|#822$# The strength of a skill and the skill's level are directly related. 
#823$# Apart from that, the skill can also be strengthened through Masteries and adding magic effects to equipment. 
#821$# Spend more time studying this - it'll make your fights easier.|
48576|#821$# If you want to know more about skills, you will definitely have to experience them for yourself! 
#824$# Do you think I achieved the skills I have today, just by sitting here and talking about it?|
48581|I wanna know about titles.|
48582|What are titles for?|
48583|#823$# Humph! I don't care for worldly things like titles at all!|
48584|#822$# Even though titles are not attractive to me, personally... 
#821$# You do get bonuses after you've obtained a title. 
#823$# That is rather interesting!|
48585|#821$# It's said, that if you continuously defeat enemies in the arena, you'll get the Hit Man title. 
#823$# Heh, I'm actually itching to try because of this!|
48586|#823$# Hmmph, I don't care at all for fame! The main thing is being able to test my skills!|
48591|Give me some tips about delving into dangerous dungeons!|
48592|I would like to know about your dungeon strategy.|
48593|#822$# Dungeon strategy is no worry for me at all; it's even more relaxing than eating, for me. 
#821$# As for you, kid... You better find a group of skilful partners before taking on the challenge.|
48594|#821$# Being in a tough dungeon is not as convenient as being out in the world, where you can escape home to look for merchants and get supplies. 
#822$# If you take up the challenge rashly, without preparing yourself, you will have no one to blame but yourself!|
48595|#823$# Heh, if you really encounter a dungeon that you are unable to surpass, try fortifying your equipment. 
#821$# For mortal Humans like yourself, this can be pretty efficient.|
48596|#824$# If my Underground Labyrinth is also a dungeon to you, none of you will be able to get through, that's for certain!|
48601|What is it like to lead an army?|
48602|How does it feel, being a leader?|
48603|#823$# Ha! That's definitely the most wonderful feeling, other than battle!|
48604|#821$# As the leader of an army, apart from needing the ability to make the best decisions...
#822$# One must also have the ability to any of one's subodinates in battle.|
48605|#823$# The social characteristics of leadership are innate, hard to explain in words.|
48606|#821$# It's rather difficult to lead an army.
#821$# If you do not have real power over your subodinates, you'll be replaced very fast!|
48611|Do you take a rest by sitting down?|
48612|Do you sit down when you are tired?|
48613|#823$# What a joke! How can I get tired? Ha!
#821$# I will definitely not sit down, even when I'm taking a rest!|
48614|#822$# Why would I take a rest by sitting down? I'll stand properly, and maintain vigilance at all times!|
48615|#822$# As long as I can find an opponent to fight, I won't rest!
#823$# I can't say the same for those who are fighting me - most of the time, they rest forever. Ha!|
48616|#823$#Rest? It's something that only the weak need! What I need is constant battle!|
48621|I hear that you live in the labyrinth?|
48622|I'd like to know about the labyrinth.|
48623|#822$# Ha! You may not know this, since you're just an ordinary Envoy of Gaia.
#821$# The place where I live is no ordinary labyrinth - it's the command post of my Underground Army!|
48624|#821$# Who told you that I live in the labyrinth? 
#823$# That's where the command post of my army is - don't you let this secret out!|
48625|#821$# My Underground Command Post is built deep within the labyrinth.
#822$# The passageways there are very complicated, and filled with deadly traps.
#823$# Even if an enemy breaks in, they will never be able to get out!|
48626|#821$# That labyrinth was designed by a legendary architect.
#822$# He used natural terrain, coupled with ingenious tricks, to make the place such that people who enter it will be trapped by the illusions.
#824$# That labyrinth turned out to be so complicated, that after it was constructed, even he almost couldn't get out of it!|
48631|Who designed your Battle Armor?|
48632|Where does your Battle Armor come from?|
48633|#821$# Hahaha, you've got taste, I made this Battle Armor myself.
#823$# I made it especially tight-fitting, so as to maintain my mobility - and looks great, doesn't it!|
48634|#822$# I made this Battle Armor when I was practising my battle skills in the labyrinth. It's pretty durable.
#823$# Therefore, even though it was made some time back, it still looks as good as new.|
48635|#822$# Why? You have something to say about my outfit?
#821$# This is actually made with rare metals found in the underground labyrinth. It's not available for sale!|
48636|#821$# Hmmph, this piece is desired by collectors, and only I have it.
#822$# You have to wash it when it's dirty,  don't be careless with it!|
48641|Tell me of other Eidolons.|
48642|I want to know the gossip of Eidolons.|
48643|#821$# At the moment, my most interesting opponent is Gigas.
#823$# I hear that he's very confident of his strength - I really wish to meet him and test his ability.|
48644|#822$# Even though Uzuriel speaks and moves like a gentle and graceful girl...
#821$# She hasn't fooled my sharp eyes.
#823$# Judging from her skills and movements, she was definitely an assassin once.|
48645|#824$# Quelkulan's venom is pretty hard to handle; it's quite hard to escape unharmed, if you fight with him.
#822$# Looks like I have to find a way to deal with his venom...|
48646|#822$# Even though I hate to admit this, Tigerius Caesar is an admirable opponent.
#821$# His command strategy and talents in battle are almost second to none.
#823$# I'd really like to drink and chat with him, if I have the chance!|
48651|Do you like to fight on your own?|
48652|You like to fight alone, right?|
48653|#823$# Hmmph, this isn't just fighting single-handedly, it's my fighting style!|
48654|#821$# Let me tell you, I'm definitely stronger when I fight alone, compared to having people like you tagging along, slowing me down.
#824$# I would have trampled you long ago, if not for your potential!|
48655|#822$# Team battles build upon individual skills as their foundation.
#821$# You must keep this in mind.|
48656|#821$# Even if you have thousands of soldiers on your side, you can't rely on anyone on the battlefield.
#823$# If you want to survive through every single battle, you can depend only on your own combat ability!|
48661|Have you participated in competitions before?|
48662|Have you competed against others before?|
48663|#823$# Ha! I wouldn't call it competition, more like one-sided trampling and crushing.|
48664|#821$# I'm still alive today, due to my constant victories in battle.
#823$# Maybe I don't respect my opponents, but I certainly don't take their skills lightly.|
48665|#824$# Hmm, competition? What a naive way of thinking.
#821$# All battles require you to gamble with your life. You can only triumph if you think of it this way.|
48666|#821$# Hmmph, competitions are for children!
#823$# I will only appear in life or death battles.|
48671|Have you carried other people before?|
48672|Do you let people ride on your back?|
48673|#824$# Can you please get this clear... Letting someone ride on your back is the biggest humiliation of all.|
48674|#821$# Even if it's a wounded person, in need of help that we are talking about, I'll still not let him ride on my back.
#822$# The biggest exception I can make, is to hold him tightly in my strong arms.|
48675|#822$# As a warrior, it's a taboo to have someone on your back.
#822$# It might be fatal if someone takes that as an opportunity to sneak attack!|
48676|#821$# The back, which can't be easily reached, is often the weakest point, as it's the easiest part to attack.
#823$# That's why I'm very firm about not letting people ride on my back - it's only reasonable!|
48681|How do you train in battle techniques?|
48682|How do you hone your combat skills?|
48683|#822$# I'll put myself alone in an underground labyrinth to train my sixth sense.
#821$# Fighting in the dark like that sharpens my combat intuition.
#823$# is what wins you victory on the battlefield!|
48684|#821$# The only effective way to train up battle techniques is to take risks with your life.
#823$# The immense will to live can stimulate your full potential!|
48685|#822$# Being familiar with your weapons is very important.
#821$# I always keep my musket by my side, using it is as natural as breathing to me.|
48686|#824$# Someone like you wants to discuss battle skills with me? You should prove you're worthy, first.|
48691|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what would you do next?|
48692|If the time to say goodbye has arrived, what plans do you have after that?|
48693|#821$# Hmm, what kind of answer do you want? I won't cry too hard.|
48694|#823$# Ha! I'll continue to lead my underground army and fight wars everywhere of course!
#822$# Of course, I'll carry out these activities secretly... Forget it, I've already said too much...|
48695|#822$# Everything changes. After we part ways, we might next meet on the battlefield.
#821$# If we meet again as enemies, you must definitely show your true strength.
#823$# Do not disappoint me! Ha!|
48696|#824$# What's the point of asking this? Just focus on facing the moment, together with me!|
48801|What would you do if you did something wrong?|
48802|If you did something wrong, what would you do?|
48803|#821$# I'd apologize of course, if I did something wrong! I know my manners...
#822$# One time I accidentally seduced Zaahir, I actually went to him with a gift to apologize!
#821$# However, Zaahir came to me with a gift to apologize after that, strange...|
48804|#821$# Why? Did you do something wrong?
#822$# I think that if I did something wrong, I should apologize... And if I bring a gift that's even better!|
48805|#824$# Hmmph... You think too little of me, if you question my manners like that!
#821$# You definitely have to apologize, if you do something wrong - how would I not understand something like that!|
48806|#822$# I know my manners best - I always bring a gift with me to apologize!
#821$# But it's really strange; everyone seems to be afraid of me going to say sorry to them?
#821$# Do you know why?|
48811|If you quarrel with your friends, what would you do?|
48812|What would you do if you got into a quarrel with your friends?|
48813|#824$# What quarrel? I would not quarrel with Nalani!
#821$# Mmm... However, it would be hard for Nalani to get into a quarrel even if she wants to, no?|
48814|#821$# Mmm.... I don't know...
#821$# Because I've never quarreled with Nalani...
#822$# I get along really really well with her!|
48815|#821$# Mmm... I've never quarreled with friends before, to be honest.
#822$# However, if I really did, I'll go apologize!
#821$# It's a small thing, and it helps to start get things settled.|
48816|#821$# Huh? Did you quarrel with your friends?
#821$# Mmm... I don't know who's in the wrong, but I think it's better for you to reach out first!
#822$# You don't want to lose friends... Right?|
48821|How good a cook are you?|
48822|Do you know how to cook?|
48823|#821$# Hmmph... My cooking skills are the best!
#822$# I'll cook for you, if there's a chance!|
48824|#823$# I love to cook most! It's fun, cooking for everyone...
#821$# However, people don't seem to like that I'm cooking, why's that?|
48825|#821$# I cook REALLY well!
#822$# When I cooked for Zaahir the other time, it was so good that he fainted!|
48826|#821$# Eh? Are you interested in cooking?
#822$# If you want to learn cooking, I can teach you!|
48831|What do you do when you aren't in a good mood?|
48832|When you're in a horrible mood, what do you do?|
48833|#821$# Mmm... I'd go look for Nalani for a chat!
#822$# As long as I see her smiling, I'll feel really really good...|
48834|#821$# Mmm... Cook for everyone?
#822$# When I watch everyone's faces while they eat, I find it very interesting!|
48835|#821$# Everytime I feel really, really lousy, I'll go look for Zaahir!
#822$# What do I do with Zaahir? That's our secret...|
48836|#821$# When I'm in a terrible mood, I'll sometimes visit Abraxas.
#822$# Why? Because I hate him so much, a bad mood doesn't feel wrong around him!|
48841|Is there anything you dislike?|
48842|What do you dislike?|
48843|#821$# Things I dislike? Mmm... let me think...
#821$# It would be Abraxas, Abraxas and Abraxas!|
48844|#821$# I hate people who look down on women - Zaahir was like that, in the past!
#821$# Luckily, after my efforts, Zaahir will never look down on women again...
#822$# Now Zaahir is my good friend!|
48845|#821$# Well, I simply hate young people who think they're Gaia's gift to the world! 
#822$# Eh? No, I'm not speaking of anyone specific. You're thinking too much...|
48846|#821$# Mmm... There are many things that I dislike, too many to list.
#822$# What about you? Do you have things that you dislike?|
48851|Let's talk about some of the different races in this world.|
48852|What do you know about some of the world's races?|
48853|#821$# Hmm... There are these little people that live in Cactakara Forest. I believe they call themselves Dwarves.
#822$# They care for the forest, and build magnificent robots!
#821$# I don't quite know how they make robots. Do you know?|
48854|#821$# Races? There are many of them!
#822$# I know of the Dwarf, the Avian, the Giant, the Sarpa...
#821$# Who do you want to know about?|
48855|#821$# I've always wondered...
#822$# Why do Avians not fly about?
#821$# Are they unable to fly?|
48856|#822$# Giants are very very tall! Almost twice as tall as me!
#821$# Be very careful if you encounter one!|
48861|What do you know of the Aura Kingdom?|
48862|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
48863|#822$# I heard that the Aura Kingdom is a place far more beautiful than Terra. 
#821$# All things that reside there are filled with joy and laughter.|
48864|#821$# Supposedly, residents of Aura Kingdom sport white wings.
#821$# Perhaps they are an offshoot of the Avian race?|
48865|#821$# Hmm... I've heard about Aura Kingdom, but I've never actually been there.
#821$# Please don't forget me, if you go there someday!|
48866|#821$# I don't really know much about the Aura Kingdom...
#821$# Perhaps you should ask someone else?|
48871|How do you keep life interesting?|
48872|What sorts of interesting things in life have you discovered?|
48873|#823$# Travelling with you keeps life interesting!|
48874|#823$# I'm so glad you asked me this question!
#822$# Sometimes it's important to chat with someone while travelling.
#821$# You gain so much knowledge that way.|
48875|#821$# Life is all about the details.
#821$# Pay attention to what you see around you.
#822$# You never know what could happen, if you miss something important!|
48876|#822$# You'll have to discover that for yourself!
#823$# Hmmm... I will support you on this.|
48881|What is the purpose of the social function?|
48882|What tips do you know about the social function?|
48883|#821$# The social function can inform you when your friends are online.
#821$# I think this is amazing! But how does it work?
#822$# Perhaps there's someone constantly watching us from the shadows?|
48884|#821$# I recall that you can contact your friends directly this way.
#822$# You can even obtain Loyalty Points by using it!
#821$# I wonder what a Loyalty is, however... Must be an Envoy thing.|
48885|#822$# You can easily contact your friends with this system!
#821$# I wish I could use it, too. Then I could contact Nalani...|
48886|#821$# Well, friends are quite important while adventuring.
#822$# So, make as many friends as you can!|
48891|Do you know of the local specialties of certain places?|
48892|Is it true that each village has its own unique product?|
48893|#822$# Oh, you're hungry! I shall cook for you!
#821$# O-oh, no need...? But I thought you were hungry!
#822$# Don't worry, I am a very good cook!|
48894|#821$# Hmm... I would love to try whatever is out there!
#822$# Don't forget to save some of what you try for me!|
48895|#821$# I have a fantastic memory; I can identify a dish with only one bite!
#821$# Which village's local specialty do you like? I can make it for you!|
48896|#822$# There are so many excellent chefs around the world; there are so many delicious specialties!
#821$# This inspires me to become an even better cook!
#822$# One day, you will taste my best dish!|
48901|Why do you always wear a mask?|
48902|Why are you always wearing a mask?|
48903|#821$# Mask? This is because...
#822$# It's a secret! Hee hee hee
#821$# I could tell you, but...|
48904|#822$# That's because if someone sees my face, I will have to marry that person!
#821$# Hee! I'm just kidding! 
#822$# I'd actually have to kill them... Hee hee...|
48905|#821$#Huh... I have been wearing this mask since the day I became a ninja.
#821$#As for the reason, I remember it being... Wanting to be more mysterious?|
48906|#821$# Oh my... That's because I'm shy...
#822$# If someone saw my face, I'd be very, very, very, very shy...|
48911|What are the requirements to be a ninja?|
48912|What kind of people can be ninja?|
48913|#821$# A ninja must be able to tolerate what cannot be tolerated!
#821$# Mmmm? Of course I'm not talking about you.
#822$# Oh my, I'm just kidding, of course! Hee hee...|
48914|#821$# Huh? How to become a ninja?
#822$# I think that, as long as one puts one's heart into it, anyone can be a ninja!|
48915|#821$# Do you want to be a ninja, too?
#823$# I think that if you were a ninja, you would be the best ninja ever!|
48916|#821$# A ninja must be quick and silent and strong!|
48921|What did you tie on your thigh?|
48922|What is that weapon do you have tied on your thigh?|
48923|#821$# This? It's a Kunai - a ninja's must-have weapon!|
48924|#821$# Eh... Don't you know?
#821$# I can't believe that you don't know about this!|
48925|#821$# These? These are kunai!
#822$# Kunais are very sharp. Do you want to try it? Hee hee...|
48926|#822$# The one on the left is the Kunai, the one on the right is the Kunei. 
#821$# What's the difference, you say? I figured you'd be smart enough to know by now! 
#822$# The one of the left is actually the same as the one on the right, haha!|
48931|Your hairband is so special!|
48932|The hairband that you use to tie your hair is very special!|
48933|#821$# Oh my... This isn't a hairband, it's a Shuriken!|
48934|#821$# Hmmph... Of course it's special!
#822$# I made this Shuriken myself!|
48935|#821$# Eh... Don't you know that this is a Shuriken?
#822$# How could you not know... You're supposed to be intelligent, right?|
48936|#822$# Hehe... It looks very good, doesn't it? Only I have this!|
48941|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
48942|Tell me some interesting tidbits about Eidolons.|
48943|#824$#Tsubaki's never before encountered anyone as vile as Abraxas.
#821$#That narcissistic jerk! He thinks he's the smoothest man alive, but he's got another coming!|
48944|#822$# Nalani is very cute!
#821$# I love Nalani's blushing face most - it's so cute that I'd like to take a bite!|
48945|#821$# Mmm.... I think that Zaahir is very strange!
#822$# When I gave him a gift the other time, he came to apologize to me instead.
#821$# Why would anyone say "sorry" when they receive a gift? Don't you think that's very strange?|
48946|#821$# Mmm... I must say, I don't know what kind of tidbit you wants to hear.
#821$# Do you want to hear things like "Abraxas doesn't wear underwear at all?"
#821$# Or things like "Zaahir has always been running naked?"|
48951|Your thighs seem to be a bit thick!|
48952|Your thighs look muscular!|
48953|#821$# Wait... What? Hey, you're really rude! 
#824$# I can't be bothered with stuff like this! Hmmph!|
48954|#824$# You've got a way with words. A really bad way! Humph!
#821$# My thighs are not too thick. They're just the right size for kicking annoying people!|
48955|#824$# Perhaps you should find Eidolons with thinner legs, then!
#821$# I don't see why it matters to you, anyway! Hmph!|
48956|#821$# Utter nonsense! There's nothing wrong with my thighs!
#824$# You're the one with a thick problem! You're thick in the head!|
48961|What do ninja do?|
48962|What do ninja need to do?|
48963|#821$# Ninja need to learn many things!
#821$# Ninjutsu alone is already a lot to learn!|
48964|#822$# Other than Ninjutsu, ninja also need to learn magic, athletics, and more!
#821$# People without determination can't be ninja!|
48965|#821$# Eh? Do you want to be a ninja too?
#822$# Mmm... The thing is, a ninja needs to learn a lot!
#821$# Is there anything wrong? Tired of being an Envoy?|
48966|#824$# Oh... I didn't think I was that good at invisibility!
#821$# Don't you notice what I've been doing, at all?
#824$# Mmm... I'm angry!|
48971|What do you do when you're not adventuring?|
48972|Do you have things you like to do in your free time?|
48973|#821$# Nothing much. Life is boring when I'm not with you.|
48974|#821$# I like to spend time with Nalani, when I can!
#821$# She's my favorite friend.|
48975|#821$# I spend a lot of time practicing my technique.
#821$# Being this graceful isn't easy!|
48976|#821$# I have so much to do, it feels like I'll never get caught up!
#821$# If only I could be two places at once, I could get it all done and never have to leave your side!|
48981|Doesn't your scarf interfere in battle?|
48982|Does your scarf get in the way when you're fighting?|
48983|#821$# Of course not! I'm very good at what I do!|
48984|#824$# Mmm... You must not think very well of me, at all!
#821$# Clothes will not hinder my performance!|
48985|#822$# My scarf has a purpose! Only my enemies will be hurt by it.|
48986|#821$# Of course not! A scarf can come in handy, lots of different ways!|
48991|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
48992|What's your plan after we separate?|
48993|#821$# Mmm... I don't know...
#822$# Do you have any suggestions?|
48994|#821$# Eh... Do you want to leave me?
#824$# Then... then I don't want you around, either, hmmph!|
48995|#821$# Mmm... I would go hang out with Nalani!
#822$# Nalani is my very best friend!|
48996|#821$# Mmm... I hadn't thought so far ahead.....
#822$# Let's talk about it when the time comes! It's years away, anyway....|
49101|What kind of food do you like most?|
49102|What's your favorite food?|
49103|#823$#Carrots! I like carrots most!|
49104|#821$# I like carrots, but radishes are also delicious.|
49105|#821$# Aside from carrots, I also like sweets.
#822$# Candies, cakes... I love all of them|
49106|#822$# Anything from you, I like.
#823$# Carrots from you are my favourite!|
49111|Do you like books?|
49112|Do you like reading?|
49113|#824$# I don't like books. Books give me a headache.|
49114|#821$# I don't like reading... Will you like me less, now?|
49115|#822$# This is not a book. This is... is...Whatever! But it's not a book!|
49116|#821$# Huh? I don't like reading... What about you?|
49121|Do you have a crush on someone?|
49122|What kind of person do you like?|
49123|#823$# Of course it's you! I have a crush on you, now!|
49124|#824$ I liked someone very much, once, but he is dead because of me...|
49125|#822$# Uhh... I don't know...
#821$# What about you? You tell me, first!|
49126|#823$# I love rabbits and carrots!|
49131|What animals do you like?|
49132|Which animals do you like most?|
49133|#823$# Little Bunnies! Little bunnies are so cuuuuuuuuute!|
49134|#821$# I looooooooove little bunnies! I want to have a little bunny so much...|
49135|#821$# Well... I like all kinds of animals.
#823$# But still, bunnies are my favourite!|
49136|#821$# What about you? I want to know about you, first.|
49141|What's your favorite season?|
49142|Do you have a preference among seasons?|
49143|#821$# Serena likes winter, because the nights are longer!|
49144|#821$# I don't like summer, because it's hot and wet.
#824$# And we have to sleep late in summer! Bad!|
49145|#821$# Uhh... I like spring!
#821$# Because there are plenty of carrots!|
49146|#821$# I also want to know your favorite season! You first!|
49151|Tell me about the Creation Myth?|
49152|What's the story of  how the world began?|
49153|#822$# Uhh... I don't know...
#821$# Do you know? Tell me!|
49154|#822$# I heard that the Cube of Gaia is the source of everything.
#821$# But no one knows where the Cube came from.|
49155|#822$# Terra, the Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium were all created by the Cube of Gaia.
#821$# I don't understand why the Cube of Gaia created terrible places like Pandemonium.|
49156|#821$# The Cube of Gaia is the mother of life.
#822$# Me and the other Eidolons are also from the Cube of Gaia!|
49161|What's special about Port Skandia?|
49162|Can you give me an introduction to Port Skandia?|
49163|#822$# Are you testing me? You are from here!
#821$# I don't like tests.|
49164|#822$# I remember there's a huge lighthouse!|
49165|#822$# Port Skandia is your hometown, right?
#821$# I know everything related to you!|
49166|#821$# Do you miss home? I'll go there with you, don't be sad.|
49171|Do you know that every place has its local specialties?|
49172|I hear that every place has its own unique, famous dish?|
49173|#824$# You never bring me along. I don't know!|
49174|#821$# Are you hungry? I'm hungry, too.|
49175|#822$# Is there any cuisine cooked with carrots?
#821$# If there is, you must bring some for me!|
49176|#821$# I often smell something nice. I imagine it must also taste delicious.|
49181|What function does the auction house have?|
49182|I would like to know information about the auction house.|
49183|#821$# I know a place where you can buy a lot of carrots.|
49184|#822$# Hmm... I remember that you can sell the items you don't need anymore to others.
#821$# Is there a carrot seller?|
49185|#821$# Find anything you want in the auction house!
#824$# But nobody sells carrot cake...|
49186|#822$# You have to pay first, to sell anything from auction house.
#821$# But I have never tried it, so I have no idea.|
49191|I would like to know about Fame Quests.|
49192|What's so special about Fame Quests?|
49193|#821$# Uhh... I heard that it is run by a girl called Mirabelle.
#822$# They seem to offer commissions for services to help people who have problems. I don't remember very clearly.|
49194|#822$# Hmm... I don't know. What do you know?|
49195|#822$# I know! Fame Quest Bulletin Boards in different regions have various fame quests.|
49196|#821$# After finishing a fame quest, a reward will be given!
#821$# I would like to have a carrot gift box...|
49201|Do you know the Goddess of the Moon?|
49202|Have you ever seen the Moon Goddess?|
49203|#821$# I have never met the Moon Goddess. But I know she is a goddess, living in the eastern world.|
49204|#822$# I heard that she lives on the moon. Is the moon of the eastern world habitable?|
49205|#821$# I heard that she has a pharmacist rabbit!
#823$# I really want to see that rabbit! It must be very very cute!|
49206|#821$# I have never met her. But I really envy her.
#821$# I also want a rabbit! a pharmacist rabbit!|
49211|Why won't you meet Aelius?|
49212|Aelius is looking for you, do you know that?|
49213|#1$# Did. You. Mention. Aelius?
#821$# How dare such a despicable and shameless pest want to see me?|
49214|#821$# Didn't I tell you not to mention him in front of me?
#1$# I will forgive you this time. Just don't do it again...
#821$# We will need to think about what to do with your tongue again...|
49215|#821$# Didn't I tell you not to mention him in front of me? 
#1$# Is something is wrong with your ears?
#821$# If they don't work, then there's no reason to keep them...|
49216|#821$# I know he is looking for me, but why should I meet with him?
#1$# I have made an unforgivable mistake because of him.
#821$# What qualifies him to meet me? And why should I meet such a guy?|
49221|I want to touch your ears.|
49222|Can I touch your tail?|
49223|#822$# Uhh... The Mother Goddess said they are untouchable...
#821$# But if it's you... I guess it would be fine.|
49224|#821$# Uhh... But I'm very ticklish...
#821$# If you really want to touch it... I'll allow you, but just this once!|
49225|#822$# The Mother Goddess said only the one who will take care of me forever can do that!
#821$# You will take care of me forever... Wouldn't you?|
49226|#821$# Well... Then I get to touch you!|
49231|I heard that you are quite old.|
49232|How old are you?|
49233|#821$# Well...That's a secret.|
49234|#821$# Huh? I'm not old at all!
#822$# I am as old as you!|
49235|#821$# Hmm... Did Kotonoha put you up to this?
#824$# It must be her! She likes playing jokes on me!|
49236|#821$# I don't know your age! You tell me, first!|
49241|I wanna know the secrets of other Eidolons.|
49242|Tell me some interesting tidbits about the Eidolons.|
49243|#823$# Grimm is so tiny and cute! I want him as my own Eidolon... can I do that?|
49244|#821$# Tigerius Caesar is my good friend. Some times he carries me to catch the wind!|
49245|#823$# Uzuriel often gives me candy. I like playing with her most.|
49246|#824$# I don't like Kotonoha, hum!|
49251|When do you normally go to bed?|
49252|Do you always go to bed late?|
49253|#821$# I go to bed very early, everyday! As soon as the sun rises!|
49254|#821$# Don't you remember? Eidolons don't need to sleep!|
49255|#821$# Hmm... I'm tired...|
49256|#822$# I don't know... I am going to bed.|
49261|What is the book in your hand?|
49262|What's in the book?|
49263|#822$# Huh? ! It's... it's a dictionary!
#821$# The dictionary is very, very boring... You won't be interested in it!|
49264|#821$# I don't want you to know about it. Stop peeping!|
49265|#822$# This is not an ordinary book, it's my sketchbook.|
49266|#821$# I should let you see it, if it is your wish...
#824$# But I don't want to...|
49271|Are you and Aelius siblings?|
49272|I heard that Aelius and you are brother and sister.|
49273|#821$# Brother? I have no brother! After that shot, my brother was already dead.
#821$# The guy you're talking about was only someone who looks like my brother.|
49274|#821$# Younger Brother? What kind of brother would mislead his own sister making such a horrible mistake?
#821$# I don't have such a brother! And I don't want to!|
49275|#821$# Who are you talking about? Is it that the coward, who covers his face with a cloak all the time?
#821$# That is not my brother. Just a pathetic, dirty worm...|
49276|#821$# Remember to never, ever mention Aelius in front of me.
#1$# If your brain doesn't work well... Then I will help you remember it. With pain.|
49281|May I sit on your moon?|
49282|Would you allow me to sit on your moon?|
49283|#824$# Hmm... I think...There is not enough space for you...|
49284|#821$# Huh? You want to sit on my moon?
#821$# But... It's only designed for me!|
49285|#824$# You're too big for it. I worry it will break.|
49286|#821$# Huh? This moon is totally un..uncomfortable!
#822$# And... and it hurts your bottom!|
49291|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
49292|What's your plan after we part ways?|
49293|#821$# You don't like me anymore? You don't want me be with you any longer?|
49294|#821$# I'll do whatever you say! Please don't leave me!|
49295|#821$# I just want to stay with you.|
49296|#824$# Uhh... I will be a good girl, please, don't leave me...|
49401|What do you desire most?|
49402|Do you have a dream?|
49403|#821$#Don't worry about me for once, let's talk about your dreams! I'm really curious.|
49404|#822$Don't compare me with any ordinary woman; 
#822$#as the great pharaoh of my nation, I, personally, can grant any wish.|
49405|#821$#Aspirations...? No one has asked me such a thing in ages;
#822$#they all seem to think that women like me have no ambitions, and I will not abide it!|
49406|#821$#I'm no plain girl, only seeking to find her true love.
#822$#My dream is even more ambitious - I will rule and have the love of an entire people.|
49411|Do you have a favorite animal?|
49412|What do you think of animals?|
49413|#823$#Wild pheasant is rather delicious, although they do have quite a bit too many feathers...
#821$#Oh, you didn't mean it that way? What was the question, then?|
49414|#821$#Animals? Hmm, I bet you like little fuzzy animals.
#822$#Are you wondering how I know? Hehe... 
#821$#Well, let's just say that you aren't the first to be captivated by my beautiful fur.|
49415|#821$#Since we're on this subject, can you tell me why so many humans wear delicious tanukis on their heads?
#822$#Could it be that....they want to seduce me? Ugh! I will not fall for such a thing!|
49416|#823$#I like animals that are a bit plump, with a lot of meat and not too many feathers or thick fur.
#822$#What? You're not talking about food?
#821$#Are you not going to assist me in preparing a lovely meal?|
49421|What kind of person are you interested in?|
49422|What kind of personality is important to you?|
49423|#822$#I prefer mature men who are independent and possess great ambitions. They are the most charming, no?|
49424|#821$#Huh? Why do you suddenly ask this?
#822$#Has Tigerius put you up to this?
#823$#Sigh, he just won't give up...|
49425|#821$#As the queen, do you think I should be afraid of not finding the perfect one for me?
#822$#I am looking for an equal who can stand at my side always.|
49426|#821$#Before replying, I'd like to hear your response first.
#822$#Certainly you don't like those humans who look great but have no brains, right?|
49431|What's your favorite weather?|
49432|Do you have a favorite weather?|
49433|#822$#I love bright, sunny days the best.|
49434|#821$#Even though the rain moisturizes the earth, I still don't like like it. 
#824$#I really hate it when my fur is all wet.|
49435|#821$#My kingdom doesn't have much rain in a year. 
#822$#What I'm most accustomed to are bright sunny days.|
49436|#821$#Naturally, I love a bright and sunny day.
#823$#When the weather's good, the most comfortable thing is to lie flat on the rooftop, basking in the sun.|
49441|Do you have any wisdom to share about art?|
49442|To you, what do you think is the most beautiful?|
49443|#821$# Huh? Don't you already have the answer after seeing me?|
49444|#821$#I...can't seem to put it into words. You'll understand more the longer we spend time together.|
49445|#821$#Beauty is rather subjective, don't you think?
#822$#If you don't think I'm beautiful, then that's ok - your sense of beauty is just different from everyone else.|
49446|#821$#Beautiful things always make people happy. 
#822$#Very few people remain unhappy after seeing me!|
49451|Let's talk about the races of Azuria.|
49452|Can you tell me about other races?|
49453|#821$#Most of the Dwarves live in Cactakara Forest.
#824$#They are enthusiastic about studying strange machines and devices that I can't understand at all.|
49454|#821$#Sarpa are not friendly towards humans at all, so don't you go provoking them!
#823$#I...am a bit curious as to how they might taste, though...|
49455|#821$#The giants live in Triatio Highlands. Even though they're incredibly slow, their strength should not be ignored.
#822$#If you don't have the agility I do, you had better avoid getting too close to them.|
49456|#821$#The Makar who rule over the Ventos Prairie are very prideful and their strength is incredible.
#823$#I sometimes think that Makar a bit similar to someone I know...
#822$#However, he doesn't have a mane like the Makar do.|
49461|What's unique about the Star Sand Desert?|
49462|Can you tell me all about the Star Sand Desert?|
49463|#821$#Everytime I see Star Sand Desert, I long to see my own kingdom.
#822$#The wide desert sands and brilliant shining sun remind me of home...|
49464|#823$#Star Sand Desert is bright and sunny nearly every day. I would love to relax in the sun some time.|
49465|#821$#There are some gigantic skeletons in the Star Sand Desert that are quite amazing to behold.
#822$#Oh, how I wish to see what those people were like when they were still alive...|
49466|#822$#The grand Ozymand Temple of the Star Sand Desert has a very long history.
#821$#It seems to be home to creatures that do not belong in the realm of Terra...|
49471|What's special about the Sky Tower?|
49472|Can you tell me anything about the Sky Tower?|
49473|#821$#I have heard that there's a mystical potion at the very top of the tower than can return the dead to life.
#823$#While I am interested in reincarnation, I'm not so sure about this...|
49474|#821$#Many different kinds of strong, magical weapons can be found on every level of the Sky Tower.
#821$#As long as you can pass every checkpoint, you'll be able to get the weapons you long for.|
49475|#821$#Many dangerous traps lay in wait within the Sky Tower.
#822$#If you plan to traverse its dangerous halls, you should take a cunning lady like me along.|
49476|#821$#You can only enter the Sky Tower at specific times,
#822$#and if you miss the opening, you won't be able to enter.|
49481|I'd like to have some information about Stat Points.|
49482|Do you have any tips on Stat Points?|
49483|#822$#When you have earned enough experience, you will receive stat points that you can allocate.
#821$#You can assign the points to wherever you think is best for your role.|
49484|#821$#If you want to be swift and agile as I am,
#822$#you should try allocating your points into speed. This will speed up your attacks!|
49485|#822$#Hmm, looking at your fragile frame and broken armor,
#821$#I would suggest that you allocate some more points into defense in order to increase your chance of survival...|
49486|#822$#If you're not satisfied with how you've spent your Stat Points, you can spend some coin to reallocate them.
#821$#However, you have better have your finances in check beforehand - I definitely won't lend you any money!|
49491|What are the benefits of salvaging equipment?|
49492|Do you have any information about salvaging?|
49493|#821$#When you salvage equipment you don't want, you'll obtain fragments.
#822$#These fragments can be use to fortify your own equipment.|
49494|#821$#If you find yourself running out of space, you can simply salvage the equipment that you don't want.|
49495|#822$#When you salvage fragments from gold quality equipment that's above level 50, you will have a chance of finding items that can altar your equipment.
#821$#You can use these items on your own equipment and tailor them to fit your needs.|
49496|#821$#Be absolutely sure that you want to salvage the equipment before you do it! There's no reversing the process.|
49501|Can you tell me about your kingdom?|
49502|What's unique about your kingdom?|
49503|#824$#My kingdom is very, very far from here...
#821$#Hopefully, someday, I'll be able to show you around.|
49504|#822$#My kingdom is a very hot land with no winters, only endless summers!
#821$#It's pretty similar to Star Sand Desert, actually.|
49505|#821$#There's a river in my kingdom that people call the Mother River. Everyone depends on it for survival.
#822$#Every time the river overflows, we hold a great ceremony.
#821$#We celebrate the generosity and kindness of the Mother River, as well as the upcoming harvest year.|
49506|#821$#When the Mother River overflows, it covers a huge are with nutrient rich water - it looks really beautiful.
#822$#I've been gone for so long... I really do miss seeing that impressive sight.|
49511|Do you know Tigerius Caesar?|
49512|What kind of Eidolon is Tigerius Caesar?|
49513|#821$#Tigerius Caesar is a very brave fighter. He's incredibly courageous and actually very charismatic.
#822$#It's a pity that... Sigh, I think I'd better hold my tongue for now.|
49514|#821$#Handsome and dashing, whenever Tigerius wins a glorious battle he is always surrounded by adoring women.
#822$#How can anyone ignore such a charismatic person?|
49515|#821$#Everyone knows of the great Tigerius Caesar!
#822$#Does he really need an introduction?|
49516|#821$#Tigerius? I kind of miss the time we spent together. 
#822$#Everytime he flies off the handle, I chuckle for the entire day.|
49521|Can I pat your head?|
49522|Do you like people patting you on the head?|
49523|#822$#What? How could I just let people go around touching my elegant head as they please?|
49524|#821$#I am very picky about the select few who I will allow to pet my majestic head.
#822$#Do you think you are qualified to do so?|
49525|#822$#Don't compare me to those lowly cats you keep as pets - 
#822$#not just anyone can touch my head!|
49526|#823$#Want to pet me on the head, do you? Then you will have to pay the price!|
49531|How do you maintain your soft fur?|
49532|What do you do to keep your fur soft and smooth?|
49533|#821$#When I wake up in the mornings I brush my fur very carefully.|
49534|#823$#I frequently brush my fur so that it always looks perfectly soft and smooth.|
49535|#821$#Why do you ask? You don't have fur, so I don't see why...
#822$#Ah! Is Tigerius trying to get my secret again?!|
49536|#822$#I'm naturally beautiful! My fur is soft and smooth almost without any maintenance at all.|
49541|I wanna know if other Eidolons keep secrets.|
49542|Do you know any interesting Eidolon gossip?|
49543|#821$#Tsubaki always keeps her face hidden. No one has ever seen what she really looks like.
#821$#Aelius also uses a scarf to obscure his face, nobody knows what he looks like either...
#822$#I wonder if these two are related somehow?|
49544|#821$#Endora is always a bother to me!
#824$#Every time she sees me, she runs up and tries to pet my head!|
49545|#823$#Serena is young and cute - she looks like she might be delicious...
#822$#Ah! Errr, I didn't say anything! Definitely nothing about eating someone!|
49546|#821$#Everytime I see Kotonoha, my claws somehow feel itchy... I'm really not sure why!|
49551|Why did you want to rule?|
49552|How did you end up as queen?|
49553|#821$#I feel as if I was born to rule, so it is just natural...|
49554|#821$#Why is it that people think a woman can't rule just as well as a man?
#822$#I make it clear to all that I am just as good, if not better, than any other ruler I know.|
49555|#821$#It's rule or be ruled, don't you think?
#822$#Such a simple question that was. Do you have any other inquiries?|
49556|#821$#To survive in my world, to be at the top is the best way.|
49561|You're very fond of Tigerius Caesar, aren't you?|
49562|Do you like Tigerius Caesar or not?|
49563|#821$#Tigerius? I don't remember mentioning him to you before - have I?|
49564|#821$#What does it matter if I like or dislike him?
#823$#Tigerius will do what he wants, regardless of anyone else's opinion on him.|
49565|#822$#Ah... You know, Tigerius Caesar is handsome, dashing, and a gentleman with women.
#821$#Who wouldn't like a man like that?|
49566|#821$#Why do you bring him up all of a sudden? Do you have some news?
#822$#Oooh, did he send you to ask these questions? Haha!|
49571|What's it like to conquer a kingdom?|
49572|Can you tell me what it's like to rule?|
49573|#821$#Ah...That's a tricky one to explain.
#822$#It's definitely no small feat to conquer a realm. The hard part is how to rule with kindness and caring.|
49574|#821$#The conqueror and the conquered need not be at odds. I find it is best to rule benevolently.|
49575|#821$#When you rule a kingdom, you have to remember that it is your responsibility for the happiness, health, and comfort of your people.
#822$#What's the point of ruling if everyone hates you?|
49576|#821$#If your people love you, then you can claim that you can rule them.
#824$#If the people don't love you, then sooner or later you will be overthrown.
#824$#And if your people really despise you...it can be even worse.|
49581|Your eyes seem very different from the other Eidolons.|
49582|Your eyes are mesmerizing...|
49583|#821$#Don't stare into my eyes too long, or you might become charmed...
#822$#I can't follow you if you're trying to be my follower!|
49584|#821$#Ah, yes. Many people fall at my feet when they look into my beautiful eyes.|
49585|#822$#Not many people in the world have eyes like mine. I can bewitch someone with a single glance.|
49586|#822$#It's true, isn't it? Once upon a time, because of these entrancing eyes, Tigerius also...hehehe...|
49591|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
49592|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
49593|#821$#If we do part, I will finally return to my kingdom.
#822$#I will stretch out in the hot sun and watch the Mother River flow across my lands.|
49594|#822$#Do you dare to cast me aside? Are you somehow not satisfied with me?|
49595|#821$#This is not for you to worry about. With my cunning capabilities, is there any place I could not go? Any thing I could not do?|
49596|#822$#Ha, maybe I'll go catch up with Tigerius... Just kidding!|
49701|What sort of person interests you?|
49702|What do you look for in a partner?|
49703|#822$#Ha! As if I'd tell you! Just having to ask shows you're not qualified for the job.|
49704|#821$#I don't understand why guys go for girls with ridiculous pink pigtails. Ugh! It just makes me want to yank on them!
#822$#And yank, and yank, and keep on yanking...|
49705|#821$#(Sigh...) My heart belongs to a young boy who doesn't know I exist.
#822$#To make up for it, I just play dumb around all of my fans who adore me!|
49706|#824$#Arrogant people are the worst!
#822$#How can they pretend to be the best when I'm obviously far better than they are at everything?|
49711|Do you have any weaknesses?|
49712|Is there anything you aren't good at?|
49713|#821$#What? How could you even say such a thing? Of course there isn't anything I'm not perfect at!
#822$#I'm offended that you've underestimated me!|
49714|#824$#It can be annoying dealing with people from...  "The Organization."
#821$#What? Of course, yes, THAT "Organization." Why do you even need to ask?|
49715|#823$#Ugh! This again? For your birthday, I'm going to buy you a dictionary.
#821$#Look up the entry for "perfect" and you'll find "Endora" written right there!|
49716|#823$#My only weakness is that I'm just TOO beautiful!
#824$#That must by why the stupid boy always blushes and runs away...
#822$#Hm? Oh, nothing. Didn't say a thing. Nope.|
49721|What do you do when you're in a bad mood?|
49722|What cheers you up?|
49723|#822$#Of course I'm going to make a scene if I'm unhappy!
#821$#But I have to be careful, otherwise "The Organization" will find out.
#824$#Those people give me the creeps!|
49724|#821$#When I'm in a bad mood, I cheer myself up by punching Serif until he passes out.
#823$#Why? Duh! Everyone says that if you like somebody, you should hit on him and take him out. Right?|
49725|#823$#My scythe always cheers me up when I'm unhappy!
#821$#Only problem is it's a bit on the small side... Don't you think?|
49726|#821$#I didn't realize you cared so much about me!
#822$#Now that I know, I've designated you as my personal stress-reliving punching bag!
#823$#Oh relax, I won't hit too hard... It'll be like a massage. We both win!|
49731|Do you have any amazing stories to tell?|
49732|What's the most amazing experience you've ever had?|
49733|#821$#Ha ha! I'll share one story with you... But first you need to fall asleep!
#823$#I love sneaking into people's dreams at night!|
49734|#822$#Ugh! What amazes me is that the stupid boy sees anything at all in the little pink brat!
#824$#This world is just too much sometimes...|
49735|#821$#A goody two-shoes like you could never appreciate my amazingnessitude!
#823$#I sneak into people's dreams and discover all of their dirty little secrets!|
49736|#823$#I know all kinds of juicy stuff! More than you could ever imagine!
#821$#If you choose to serve me well...
#822$#Maaaybe I'll share some with you. Maybe. If I'm in a good mood.|
49741|Have you ever joined any groups or clubs?|
49742|Do you ever participate in group activities?|
49743|#821$#Hehe, well, if you really wanna know, I'll tell you one...
#822$#When I was in school... I was a cheerleader! That's right, cheerleader.|
49744|#821$#Haven't you noticed how absolutely perfect and wonderful I am in every single way?
#822$#I am the most popular, fabulous, shining star that any Social Club could ever hope to have! I still can't believe they never let me join!|
49745|#821$#When I was a cheerleader, I stole the hearts of millions and millions of cute boys!
#821$#Some of them still don't leave me alone, so I started transforming them into things. That's where my little pumpkins come from!|
49746|#822$#Group activities? You mean, like, after-school stuff, right?
#821$#Okay, phew. You had me worried there for a second.|
49751|What's so special about the Sky Tower?|
49752|What can you tell me about the Sky Tower?|
49753|#821$#The Sky Tower, huh? Supposedly it's chock-full of fearsome baddies and fabulous treasure!
#823$#What, are you scared? Hmph! Not me! I want to go check it out!|
49754|#821$#I wonder how tall the Sky Tower is... And I wonder how much damage a coin would do if I dropped it off the top?|
49755|#821$#The Sky Tower? The ol' G.B. had it locked up a long time ago.
#823$#I wonder why? What sort of freaky business is inside?|
49756|#821$#Guess what? I snuck into the Sky Tower once!
#823$#I'll bet you want to know what's in there, don'tcha?
#822$#You do? Haha! I'll never tell!|
49761|What do you know about the Star Sand Desert?|
49762|Is there anything interesting in the Star Sand Desert?|
49763|#822$#Bleh! Why are you interested in that dull, dry place?
#824$#Don't you know that all that sun and sand is bad for your skin?|
49764|#823$#A little birdie told me that there are a lot of CRAAAZY treasures hidden in the Ozymand Temple.
#821$#You want to get them, don't you? I sure do! Get out the sunblock and let's go-go-go!|
49765|#821$#There are a lot of mercenaries looking for work in the Star Sand Desert.
#823$#Hmm, maybe if I hired some of them, they could knock some sense into that stupid boy...|
49766|#823$#There's a camp built around an oasis in the Star Sand Desert.
#821$#I guess water is pretty important when the sun threatens to melt your face off every day.|
49771|Can you tell me a little bit about Alchemy?|
49772|What do you know about Alchemy?|
49773|#821$#Alchemists can supposedly turn stone into gold, which seems kinda cool.
#822$#But then they just sit around mixing potions and bottles and junk... Bo-oring! Who has time for that?|
49774|#822$#Pfft! I could never wrap my head around such a boring subject.
#824$#The most fun I had in Alchemy class was dreaming up excuses to get out of tests...|
49775|#821$#(Yawn) You'll put me to sleep if you keep talking about Alchemy.
#824$#There are a bunch of Alchemist nerds hanging out in Navea; why don't you go talk to them?|
49776|#2$#Alchemy, huh... I wonder if they can cook up a love potion...
#822$#Uh... What? No, I didn't say anything!|
49781|What's the deal with fishing?|
49782|What do you know about fishing?|
49783|#821$#Yeah, fishing can be interesting, I guess. If you've got nothing better to do with your time...
#823$#I usually just wait for other people to catch something, then beat them up and take it from them!|
49784|#821$#Fishing? In school, the cool kids like me never had time for boring junk like fishing!
#823$#But... Well... Actually... I kinda like fishing. Don't you dare tell anyone! I'll kick your butt!|
49785|#821$#Fish have all kinds of uses! You can fry them, poach them, sashimi them...
#823$#There are even some that can give you XP bonuses! Neat!|
49786|#821$#If you think you've got good fishin' chops, you can challenge those King Fish that rule each area.
#823$#You'll earn big, huge, stupefying rewards if you can bag them!|
49791|What do you know about monster conquests?|
49792|Do you have any tips on monster conquests?|
49793|#822$#Pfft! There are weak monsters, there are tough monsters, and then there's me!
#824$#If you can't win by yourself, then just hide behind me and I'll do all the work. Like always!|
49794|#821$#Every baddie has a weakness. Some don't like fire. Some don't like status effects. Others can't handle criticism.
#823$#Study your enemy until you know what makes them tick, and then CRUSH THEM!|
49795|#821$#What? It's easy! Just avoid getting hit while doling out as much damage as you can.
#823$#Even a noob like you can manage that, right?|
49796|#821$#Make sure you have a proper meal before going into battle!
#823$#A lot of cuisine has beneficial effects that can help you win.|
49801|Where do you live?|
49802|Where did you live before now?|
49803|#822$#You see this? This is my annoyed face.
#824$#I used to live in a crummy place. I'm never going back!|
49804|#822$#Stupid "Organization" and it's stupid rules... There was never any fun to be had there, ever!|
49805|#822$#That place sucks!
#824$#It's hard to believe that amazing people like myself and Ser - I mean, that stupid boy - came from there!
#822#Oh, and the pink brat is from there, too. But that's about what I'd expect.|
49806|#822$#I hate that place! But the stupid boy seems to like it, so maybe I'll try and find him there...|
49811|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
49812|What makes your scythe special?|
49813|#821$#What, this old thing? It has served me well in many battles.
#823$#But... Oh, I just don't know... I think I might need something bigger, don't you?|
49814|#821$#I got this scythe from the same place the pink brat got her silly little twig.
#823$#I'd say I got a much better deal, wouldn't you?|
49815|#823$#My scythe? I've named her Justine, and sometimes we have deep conversations. That's not weird, is it?|
49816|#821$#Be careful what you say! Justine will kick your butt if you aren't nice to her!
#823$#Sometimes we'll find someone who is sleeping and cut their dreams up into pieces, and then rearrange them!|
49821|Where did you get your kitty backpack?|
49822|Does your kitty backpack have a name?|
49823|#822$#He's no ordinary backpack! His name is Serifinho!
#824$#Oh, look, you've made him nervous. It's okay, little Serifinho, they didn't mean it...
|
49824|#824$#A backpack? Can't you use your eyes?
#821$#How could you mistake my little kitty Serifinho for just a backpack?|
49825|#824$#Hmph! How rude!
#824$#Asking me if Serifinho is a backpack... Look, you've gone and made him upset!|
49826|#822$#Serifinho, this silly Envoy thinks you're just a backpack! Ha! I know!
#822$#Don't worry, Serifinho! Just ignore them like anyone else who doesn't know what they're talking about.|
49831|Do you think you're attractive?|
49832|Do you get compliments about your figure?|
49833|#823$#Took you long enough to notice!
#821$#Face of an angel and the body of a devil! That's Endora for ya!|
49834|#823$#Of course! I have the best figure out of all the Eidolons!
#821$#And if we're being honest here, I'm a little miffed that you even had to ask!|
49835|#823$#Of course! I'm cute and popular!
#821$#Just look at all this fan mail I write to myself... I mean, that my adoring fans send me!
#824$#Why would anyone want to hang out with those other dumpy Eidolons?|
49836|#823$#Ha! I knew this was coming. You, just like everyone else in the world, has fallen for me!
#821$#It's tough being super cute and popular, but somehow I manage to survive.|
49841|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
49842|Have any good rumors about other Eidolons?|
49843|#822$#Have you ever tried talking to Eligos? ZOMG! Such a bore!
#824$#He's always like 'Oh, I'm rich and powerful, but I'm sad all the time.' Gag me with a spoon!|
49844|#822$#Uzuriel is the highest ranking member of the Super-Hyper-Awesome Endora Fan Club.
#821$#She's the perfect Number Two; almost as skilled, but nowhere near as cute!|
49845|#821$#Nazrudin is SO annoying! He's always like, 'Sit up straight! Shoulders back! Your salad fork goes on the left!'
#823$#That eel drives me crazy! I'm glad he lives underwater so I don't have to deal with him.|
49846|#823$#I like Alessa. You know why? We both share a deep hatred of the pink brat.
#821$#Alessa plays a crucial role in my plan to get rid of the pink brat for good. Do you want in on it as well?|
49851|How well do you know Serif?|
49852|What do you think about Serif?|
49853|#2$#Serif? Ooooh, where is that stupid boy?|
49854|#821$#Just so you know, the stupid boy is mine. Got it?
#822$#He's off limits! Forbidden! Don't even think about it!|
49855|#822$#OH MY GAWL! That stupid boy is obsessed with the awful pink brat!
#824$#Outrageous, right? What can he possibly see in her?|
49856|#2$#Serif and I had a breakthrough today! At long last the stupid boy will be all mine!
#822$#What? I did NOT drug him! How could you even think that? Although... it's not a bad idea...|
49861|Do you know Merrilee?|
49862|Do you have a problem with Merrilee?|
49863|#822$#Barf! I hate the pink brat so much I can't even think straight!
#824$#And yet the stupid boy is obsessed with her! It just isn't fair...
|
49864|#821$#Have you ever tried to talk to her? She only knows three words: snakes, apples, and 'loooooove.' Blech!
#822$#I'm a hundred times more interesting than she is! A thousand! A kajillion!|
49865|#821$#Merrilee? Just saying her name is enough to make my skin crawl!
#822$#(Sigh...) I need some chocolate.|
49866|#821$#Seriously? You're not comparing me to that pink brat, are you?
#823$#No? Good. Trust me, you don't want to be on my bad side.|
49871|What's your insight into fashion?|
49872|Do you get compliments on your outfit?|
49873|#821$#I was the most popular girl in school!
#823$#The socialite, the trend-setter, Miss Popular; everyone copied my style.|
49874|#823$#You like my style, too, right? What am I saying... of course you do! I look great in everything!
#821$#I could turn up in a garbage bag and still be Prom Queen! Or worse... denim!|
49875|#823$#The centerpiece of my ensemble is my adorable kitty...
#821$#Serifinho is a hundred times better than any other cat in the world!|
49876|#824$#You bet! Everyone loves kickin' it with Endora!
#822$#...except the stupid boy. He runs away whenever he sees me. It makes me so mad!|
49881|Wow, that's a, uh, 'great' dance!|
49882|Where did you learn to dance like that?|
49883|#821$#Right? I'm the best dancer there ever was and ever will be!
#823$#I used to be the captain and president and CEO of the cheerleading squad. I've got the moves!|
49884|#823$#There's a song that goes along with this dance. Want me to sing it?
#821$#...hey, wait! Where are you going?|
49885|#824$#Dancing is just one of my many amazing talents. That's why everyone loves me!
#823$#I'm just so talented, and popular, and beautiful, and awesome, and smart, and cool, and down-to-earth, and...|
49886|#821$#I got some hot moves, right? You want me to teach you how to dance?
#823$#Of course, you'll never be as good as me, but don't let that get you down!|
49891|If we had to part ways, where would you go?|
49892|What would you do if we parted company?|
49893|#823$#Oh, I'll totally be fine, I swear. I have all sorts of stuff to keep me busy.
#822$#There is still a lot of stalking... uhm, I mean 'quality time,' with Serif to be had!|
49894|#823$#I'll never forget you. I always remember each and every one of my fans!
#821$#...just so long as you keep sending me fan mail.|
49895|#821$#Why are you asking me this all of a sudden?
#822$#The pink brat put you up to it, didn't she? Ooooh! I'm gonna throttle her!|
49896|#824$#As if I'd let one of my adoring fans leave me!
#821$#Be careful if you do ever manage to slip away, though...
#823$#I'll sneak into your dreams at night and make mischief!|
50001|What kind of people do you like to date?|
50002|What do you look for in a partner?|
50003|#821$#Dates? You mean like...the fruit?|
50004|#822$#I'm looking for a partner who values me as I truly am, not only as they perceive me to be.|
50005|#824$#Dating seems to be a very important ritual among humans.
#821$#Tell me more about it! What do you do on a date?|
50006|#824$#In the past, I was courting someone and...
#822$#Oh snap, I wasn't going to mention that!|
50011|Do you like to travel?|
50012|What are your thoughts on traveling?|
50013|#823$#Travel is fun! I haven't done too much traveling, and that's part of the reason I decided to go on this adventure with you.|
50014|#821$#When you're saving the world, danger doesn't usually show up on your doorstep.
#822$#You've gotta travel to find the danger, then hit it with your fists of fury!|
50015|#821$#I've come to enjoy traveling with you.
#823$#It makes me so happy when each day brings new sights and sensations.|
50016|#824$#We saw so much sadness while on the road.
#821$#My other self is reminded frequently about how little of this world she knows about.
#823$#Fortunately, I assured her that the world is not yet beyond saving.|
50021|What's a good way to train?|
50022|How do you train for battle?|
50023|#821$#Traveling seems to be doing the trick. You never know what this adventure will throw at us next - it's excellent physical and mental preparation!|
50024|#821$#Keeping to my diet is a feat in itself! Every time I have to step on that scale, it's like psyching up before a big battle!
#822$#Crap...did I just say that aloud?|
50025|#824$#It's hard to say. What works for me might not be as effective for you.
#821$#Developing your self-discipline and critical thinking will help you prevail in any endeavor, though, so stick with those for sure.|
50026|#822$#Practice does not always make perfect - perfect practice makes perfect. Be sure not to rush - the purpose of training is to learn the right way.|
50031|Do you have any tips for getting along with people?|
50032|Any advice for me about relationships?|
50033|#824$#I don't quite understand your meaning.
#821$#I always thought we got along pretty well, you and I...|
50034|#821$#It's easier to get along with birds than humans.
#824$#A bird acts as their heart directs, but the words of a human are often very different from their actions.|
50035|#821$#The world has in it many bad people, but there are many who are good as well.
#821$#Wherever I go, my calling is to protect the innocent from those who would do them harm.|
50036|#821$#It's important to be open to new experiences, even if you're a bit afraid at first.
#823$#I didn't know quite what I was getting into, but then I came to this world and met you. Worth taking a chance on, wouldn't you say?|
50041|What animals do you like?|
50042|What do you think of animals?|
50043|#823$#Oh, I love little birds so much!
#821$#When they're about to make their first flight, I always cheer them on!|
50044|#823$#Animals don't lie, so it's comforting to talk with them.|
50045|#821$#I feel like all birds are weird second and third cousins.
#823$#My little pal here is my favorite bird, though.|
50046|#821$#When I'm feeling down, birds always tend to come around to cheer me up.
#823$#I try to return the favor by helping them out wherever I can.|
50051|What's it like in Navea?|
50052|What do you think about Navea?|
50053|#821$#Navea is full of motion and splendor, like a kaleidoscope! It's like there's always something going on there.
#824$#The first time we went there, my little feathered friend here got so wound up, she actually fainted.|
50054|#821$#Navea's always so full of life and laughter.
#823$#Truly, it must be a holy city, to bring peace and joy to the lives of so many.|
50055|#824$#I felt a little awkward walking around the streets of Navea.
#822$#People stared at me a lot. Young men's eyes seemed to double in size when I walked by.|
50056|#824$#Humans seem to like living very cozily, with many coexisting in a small space.
#821$#My palace is actually much larger than the city of Navea.|
50061|What can you tell me about the Avians?|
50062|I'd like to know more about the Avians.|
50063|#821$I was taken aback the first time I saw the Avians.
#824$To be birds, and yet incapable of flight...honestly, I felt a bit sorry for them.|
50064|#824$In spite of being a bird-lover, I'm none too fond of the Avians.
#821$If I see them, I avoid them if I can.|
50065|#821$I heard before that the Avians were strange creatures, but I didn't understand how until I saw them for myself.
#824$Now I can see why many races don't have a high opinion of them.|
50066|#824$Why DID the Avians give up their ability to fly?
#821$#Have your world's scholars chronicled how it happened?|
50071|What can you tell me about PvP?|
50072|Tell me about the Arena.|
50073|#821$#The Arena provides a good opportunity to train.
#821$#Better to make your mistakes there than on the battlefield, right?|
50074|#821$#I fought some battles in tournaments long ago.
#823$#They called me the Scarlet Whirlwind for my punishing kicks of fiery awesomeness!
#822$#In fact, this one time, there I was, down to my last HP...|
50075|#823$#If you're going to the arena, clad yourself in purple-quality gear.
#821$#Ultimately it's about skill, but good equipment makes you that much more effective.|
50076|#821$#I've heard that if you want to test your skill, the Arena is the place to do it.
#823$#I think you're good enough to come out a champ. Let's see some gold medals!|
50081|I want to know more about archaeology.|
50082|What can you tell me about Archaeology?|
50083|#821$#Archaeology is a great way to learn about who - and what - came before us.
#823$#You're very fortunate to have the opportunity to unearth the treasures of the past.|
50084|#821$#I just remembered, there are merchants in Navea who specialize in collecting artifacts of archaeological importance.
#823$#If you dig up anything interesting, I'll be they'd take it off your hands for a good price.|
50085|#823$#The humans of old have gone to the great beyond. They can't spend mortal wealth, so you might as well benefit from it.
#821$#For example, I've heard you can exchange artifacts for fortification items. But...what is this "fortification"?|
50086|#821$#You can find ruins and other archaeological sites in almost every area of the world.
#821$#If you're looking for artifacts, it's best to go straight to the source!|
50091|What's the point of joining a guild?|
50092|What are your thoughts on guilds?|
50093|#821$#I've heard of these "guilds" - clandestine organizations where members gather together to plot assaults and eat ice cream...|
50094|#821$#Can I join a guild?
#824$#An Eidolon should be able to join a guild if they want to, I think.|
50095|#821$#I'm told that if a guild becomes prestigious enough, they'll gain their own tract of land.
#823$#What kind of place do you suppose it is? Is it as big as my palace?|
50096|#822$#I've heard guilds are a good place to get to know others.
#824$#Joining one could be nice, but for now, I'll take getting to know others one person at a time.|
50101|How do you meditate?|
50102|What's the secret to successful meditation?|
50103|#2$#It looks very serene, right? So serene that I've fallen asleep meditating before.
#822$#It's like my own mind betrayed itself!|
50104|#821$#Whatever you do, don't fall asleep while meditating. If you do, people might try to draw things on your face.|
50105|#821$#You know, whenever I meditate...
#824$#My little birdie here will just quietly fall asleep.|
50106|#821$#Before meditating, you should clear the area of clutter and distractions.
#824$That way, your mind won't become fixated on what's around you.|
50111|Your pet is so cute!|
50112|What's your pet's name?|
50113|#824$#She doesn't like being called a pet, honestly - says she prefers to be known as my "valued and esteemed partner".|
50114|#822$#She says "I'm a deity! How could you call me a pet!"|
50115|#821$#Sometimes I think it'd be fun to have a pet.
#824$#But if I had one, my friend here would think I wasn't giving her enough attention!|
50116|#824$#Vermilion thinks really highly of Southern Star.
#821$#I've raised Suzaku here since she was just a little chicklet. She might seem kind of weird...and maybe a little lumpy, but before you, she was my only real companion.
#823$#This is Southern Star... He is... Vermilion... my relative...|
50121|Are you not really the talkative type?|
50122|You're always so quiet.|
50123|#824$#I'm not sure I get the question.
#821$#Is there something I'm misunderstanding?|
50124|#821$#Well, you know what they say - "Something something, blah blah, speak no evil!"
#823$#Now, how did the rest of that go? It sounded so wise when I heard it...|
50125|#821$#Where I'm from, I don't get many visitors - not even other spirits.
#824$#I suppose I still feel a bit awkward with conversation, but don't give up on me!|
50126|#823$#You seem to be able to talk to anyone. Maybe I should be asking for YOUR secret.
#821$#Can you teach me how to talk to anyone with bold confidence?|
50131|If you could have one wish granted....|
50132|What's your greatest wish?|
50133|#821$I wish to take to the sky; to just soar at amazing speeds and feel lighter than air.
#823$I could sail through the sky all day and never come down.|
50134|#821$#It would be super great if I could stop drooling every time I fall asleep...
#822$#Oh crappers, you weren't supposed to know about that!|
50135|#821$#I'd like to see others be at peace with themselves, and with others.
#823$#If you've got that, you can make remarkable strides as an individual.|
50136|#823$#Me and the fuzzball love adventuring with you!
#821$#Tacky as it might sound, I'm living my dream right now.|
50141|Tell me a secret or two about the other Eidolons.|
50142|Can you tell me some interesting Eidolon facts?|
50143|#821$#I have known Vayu for a very long time.
#824$#But each time we meet, we seem to get into a spat. I guess even the sky isn't big enough for the both of us.|
50144|#821$#Spending time with Nalani puts my mind at ease.
#823$#She's like a deep wellspring of peaceful vibes that leaves anyone she talks to feeling refreshed.|
50145|#821$#Yarnaros has such a booming voice! When he speaks, it always catches me off-guard.
#821$#At least he has interesting things to say, though! It would truly be a curse to be both booming and boring.|
50146|#824$#It doesn't seem like Bel-Chandra likes me much.
#821$#Ever since I became interested in dancing, I think she sees me as "the competition".|
50151|Where do you come from?|
50152|Where do you live?|
50153|#823$#My palace floats high in the Southern Skies, though you'd have to travel to the realm of spirits to see it.
#821$#Few venture there, aside from those of my tribe.|
50154|#821$#The palace that is my home rises above the clouds. It shimmers in the sunsets like a fiery mountain.|
50155|#822$#I come from the Southern Sky. Even in the realm of spirits, where distances are harder to calculate, it is quite remote.|
50156|#824$#I live in a palace, of course. I'm enjoying my time out in the world, but I think my little friend here misses her nest.|
50161|What style of martial arts do you study?|
50162|What makes your martial art style unique?|
50163|#823$#The full name is the "Southern Phoenix Radiant Ascending Fist"
#821$#That's kind of long, so I just call it the Phoenix Fist Style.|
50164|#821$#I've tempered my martial art style around the idea that I'm not hurting enemies so much as I'm saving allies.|
50165|#823$#I mix a lot of my attacks with fire, as I'm sure you've noticed.
#821$#That's a phoenix for you - the flame of death is also the flame of rebirth!|
50166|#821$#Maaaaybe if you stick with me long enough, I'll teach you a few things.
#822$#But always remember: knowing a martial art is a responsibility, not just for looking really cool - though that IS a nice side-effect.|
50171|Your outfit looks really good on you.|
50172|Tell me about your outfit.|
50173|#824$#I decorated this outfit with feathers donated by members of the phoenix tribe.
#821$#It's quite fetching, don't you think?|
50174|#821$#It's a surprisingly comfortable outfit.
#823$#Loose enough in all the right places, and snug enough in all the right places.
|
50175|#823$#When I created these clothes, I was inspired by martial arts clothing and dancewear.
#821$#It allows freedom of movement while still showing off all my best plumage.|
50176|#823$#Oooh, is that a compliment?
#821$#I'm glad you like it! I put lots of thought into the design.|
50181|You're always with that bird.|
50182|Do you and your bird have a special connection?|
50183|#824$#This little gal had no one to hatch her, so I hatched her egg myself.
#821$#We've been with each other so long that we can understand each other's feelings without words.|
50184|#824$#Sometimes I get so absorbed in everything going on around me, but when I look at my friend, I remember where I come from and why I'm here.|
50185|#821$#She looks so adorable, you know, but in reality, she's proud and a bit sensitive, as phoenixes tend to be.
#822$#Only I can call her a fuzzball without retribution!|
50186|#821$#She's my only real family. Well...before I had you, anyway.
#823$#She's been enjoying this journey a lot, just as I have.|
50191|If we had to part ways, what would you do next?|
50192|If we were to separate one day, what would your plans be?|
50193|#824$#I suppose I would continue exploring this mortal realm with my little friend.|
50194|#821$#You've been so kind, taking me along, teaching me all kinds of things about this realm.
#824$#Even if we were to part, I would never forget your kindness...|
50195|#821$#There's so much sorrow in this world.
#823$#I think I might like to keep traveling and helping others, putting a smile on many faces.|
50196|#821$#We've had our good times and bad times, but I'd miss them all if we parted ways.|
50301|How do you like to spend your leisure time?|
50302|What do you do when you have free time?|
50303|#823$# Oho, are you implying we ought to spend more time together?
#821$# I shall be content as long as you appreciate a good song and story.|
50304|#822$#I... prefer not to be left alone with my thoughts.
#824$# Idling away in the cold robs one of warmth.|
50305|#821$# When you're resting, I often compose new poems and songs.
#822$# I'm thinking of writing a ballad based on our piraresque adventures.|
50306|#821$# In order to keep my panoply of skills honed, I often practice them when I have no other pressing matters.|
50311|What's your favorite season?|
50312|Which season do you like best?|
50313|#824$# When winter's chill has run its course, the winds of spring paint the land with color. I look forward to that season each year.|
50314|#821$# I hail from the northerly realms, where winter's grip seldom fades.
#823$# That is why experiencing spring, summer, and autumn here is quite inspiring.|
50315|#822$# Despite the frozen nature of my powers, I do not particularly like the winter.
#824$# Standing in the snow, looking ever to the gray horizon...it is a lonesome existence.|
50316|#821$# There is something about the vivacity of spring that has always held my fancy.
#823$# And what of you? Which season do you favor?|
50321|So...what's your type?|
50322|What kind of person do you find attractive?|
50323|#823$# Ara ara~ Looking at brave wanderers has sometimes filled my mind with improper notions.|
50324|#821$# One who will keep the vows they have made; one who will look into your eyes and not turn away.
#823$# From a person of that steadfastness I shall not turn away.|
50325|#824$# At times, I ponder whether I have lingered so long in the cold that my heart has frozen over.
#822$# Perhaps that is why I eagerly await the thaw of spring.|
50326|#823$# Ara ara~ It seems you're interested in more than simply poetry and song.
#821$# But now I am curious - what manner of person do YOU favor?|
50331|What do you think it means to have tenderness?|
50332|What is tenderness to you?|
50333|#821$# Tenderness encompasses being receptive to the feelings of one's partner.
#822$# Of course, allowing enemies to die a cold, peaceful death could also be said to be tender...|
50334|#821$# Be mindful - those that treat you with greatest tenderness and gentleness are not necessarily those with your best interest at heart.
#823$# Tenderness can be used subversively, to weaken one or cause one to lower one's guard.|
50335|#822$# Tenderness is more often found in deed than in appearance.
#821$# A woman with a visage frosty as snow may have a tender heart,
#824$# just as a man who burns with outward zeal may be cold as ice within.|
50336|#821$# The way you go out of your way to help others, even when it inconveniences you...
#823$# There is certinly something of tenderness in you, no?|
50341|What do you think about traveling?|
50342|Care to share your thoughts on traveling?|
50343|#821$# Traveling with you, I have met a colorful array of people in the mortal world.
#823$# It has been quite the educational experience - and of course, an amusing one.|
50344|#822$# When traveling, having companions is best.
#824$# To travel alone is a tiring affair.|
50345|#822$# Some who chase dreams head away to the frontiers in search of adventure, but most return to their hometown from time to time.
#824$# It gives me cause to wonder if you'll one day return, or if you'll live your life as a wanderer.|
50346|#821$# Though traveling alone can be tiring, it allows one the opportunity to truly know themselves.
#822$# Being alone in an unfamiliar environment will quickly show your strengths and weaknesses both.|
50351|What's special about the Oblitus Wood?|
50352|Could you tell me something about the Oblitus Wood?|
50353|#821$# Walking through those enchanted woods can make one forget their melancholy.
#823$# If you have any cares that rest greatly on your shoulders, perhaps you, too, can visit there.|
50354|#822$# I've heard that some traveler saw the silhouette of a demon deep within the woods.
#821$# Perhaps that is the cause of the forest's current condition...|
50355|#824$# The Oblitus Wood... I wonder if, perhaps, I have forgotten something within its depths...|
50356|#821$# I had heard tell from other spirits about the beauty those woods once possessed.
#822$# One day, when that forest returns to its former self, perhaps we may tarry in its shade.|
50361|Have you heard of the "Otherworld" Dungeons?|
50362|What do you know about these "Otherworld" places?|
50363|#821$# I have heard that some Eidolons hide themselves within these Otherworlds.
#822$# If you strike down the bosses within, perhaps you'll receive a challenge from an Eidolon.|
50364|#822$# The Otherworld is not unlike a separate dimension mirroring your own.
#821$# But where this world's energy is positive, the Otherworld's is negative. If you explore there, be wary.|
50365|#821$# The enemies who reside in the Otherworld are more difficult than you might think based on their appearances.
#823$# However, the rewards for defeating them are also proportionally greater. To the victor, the spoils, as they say.|
50366|#821$# The rhythm of the Otherworld is fixed, like the ticking of a clock.
#822$# If you can calculate when the dimension resets itself, you can challenge it when it is more convenient for you.|
50371|Tell me about Quests.|
50372|Do you have any info about Quests?|
50373|#822$# I've heard of an organization called the Mirabelle Group, which specializes in helping people in need.
#821$# As you may know, their clients pay well for the services of adventurers such as yourself.|
50374|#821$# If experience is what you seek, you will find quests well worth your time.
#823$# Many give notable rewards that would be of use on your journey.|
50375|#823$# I see you have no lack of enthusiasm when it comes to completing them, that is certain.|
50376|#821$# Some areas possess special "Daily Quests" for you to do.
#822$# Some are straightforward, some not, but most seem worth your while.|
50381|What do you think of Terra?|
50382|What can you tell me about Terra?|
50383|#824$# I have spent my life in the winter lands, so my knowledge of Terra is, unfortunately, limited.|
50384|#822$# It is said in the spirit realm that Terra was brought into being fully-formed by the Cube of Gaia.
#821$# To paint such varied landscapes, such diverse people - the Cube truly has a power beyond compare.|
50385|#821$# Most of Terra's races seem to have seen the benefits of peace, but as always, some warmongers yet remain.
#824$# These warlike tribes have been quite active as of late. One cannot help but feel that a greater conflict is inevitable.|
50386|#821$# Terra is a world unto itself, but it sits within the mortal realm.
#822$# The Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium likewise sit as antipodes in the realm of spirits.|
50391|I'd like to know about Dragon Points!|
50392|What can you tell me about Dragon Points?|
50393|#821$# The strong beasts of this world have within them the energy of Gaia.
#821$# If you strike them down, you will be able to accumulate this energy. "Points" are the traditional measurement for those who harvest this energy.
#823$# And when you've gathered enough energy, you can convert it into interesting items.|
50394|#821$# It is said that by defeating certain powerful monsters, the energy of Gaia within them will flow to you.
#822$# If you collect enough of this energy - these "points" - you can convert it into items.|
50395|#821$# Ah, those. They can be acquired by besting monsters in combat.
#823$# Fishermen have also said that defeating the Fish Kings around the world bestows such points.|
50396|#821$# I am given to wonder what kinds of rewards these points may be redeemed for. 'Tis a bit exciting to guess at!|
50401|Wow, your pet is really cute!|
50402|Is that your pet?|
50403|#821$# Oh, you noticed? Yes, this is my Pipe Fox, Momiji.
#822$# I brought him with me from the spirit realm's winter lands to keep me company in my travels.|
50404|#2$# Come on out, you naughty little thing. Don't be shy.|
50405|#821$# Ah, you must be referring to Momiji.
#822$# He's a small pipe fox - they're a rather shy sort around strangers. Normally, he stays curled up in my sleeves.|
50406|#823$# Momiji is a small pipe fox who accompanied me from the spirit realm. 
#822$# He's rather shy, so you don't see him poke his head out that often.|
50411|What special skills do you have?|
50412|What would you say is your best talent?|
50413|#821$# Of talents I have many - dancing, poetry, calligraphy, ice magic, singing, and I am often told I am quite the shamisen player.
#823$# Remind me later and I shall favor you with a fine folk-tune.|
50414|#821$# I know a dance, called "Cherry Blossoms Scattering Upon the Snowdrifts", that can entomb all those before me in solid ice. 'Tis quite the sight!|
50415|#822$# I have picked up a few skills here and there - being multifaceted is the hallmark of a good entertainer.
#2$# What would you say? Are you not entertained?|
50416|#821$# When one is snowed in by the storms of midwinter, one quickly learns how to spin an engaging tale.
#823$# With a fine story and a song, the hours can fly by, so I have found.|
50421|Wow, your skin is really pale.|
50422|Do you have to keep out of the sun to stay so pale?|
50423|#823$# Oh? Do you think the pallor of my skin draws attention?
#822$# Though you are far from the first to admire my complexion, I am pleased you seem to find it appealing.|
50424|#822$# I grew up amidst the ice and snow - naturally, I tend toward being pale. Don't be too passionate, or I just might melt away!
#823$# Ahaha, is that a blush I see?|
50425|#821$# In truth, I would like to enjoy the warmth of the sun.
#823$# However, when one produces one's own snowstorms, that prospect becomes difficult...|
50426|#824$# Snow-white skin to tanned bronze - there are many shades, and people who delight in each. So have we all our tastes.|
50431|Could you sing a song for me?|
50432|I'd like to hear you sing.|
50433|#821$#Ara ara~ Quite the affectionate request today, no?
#823$# What would happen if you were moved to tears by my song?|
50434|#824$# Gladly would I oblige, but I am...hesitant.
#822$# At times my song is as a siren's, lulling people to a final, quiet rest upon the snow.|
50435|#821$# When I play my shamisen and sing, wind and snow oft accompany the performance.
#824$# As such, most of my entertaining is done out of doors. Be sure to dress warmly!|
50436|#824$# When I sing, I sometimes think of those who loved my songs in times past, who are now gone. It is a melancholy reflection, as you might expect.|
50441|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
50442|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
50443|#822$# Do you know of Kaiser Zeta? The spirits say his soul is full of burning justice.
#821$# Quite a passionate individual, it would seem - apparently, he tries to teach energetic youths the power of 'combining'.|
50444|#824$# Vermilion makes her dwelling far in the southerly lands of the spirit realm. She seems an erudite soul - I would like to take tea with her someday.|
50445|#822$# It's said that in her mortal life, Cleopawtra ruled over an expansive desert kingdom.
#824$# Do you think the traces of that empire can still be found somewhere in this world?|
50446|#823$# Tsubaki just exudes style and flair with her choice of outfit!
#821$# I wish I could try on her garments someday...|
50451|What's your hometown like?|
50452|Tell me a bit about where you're from.|
50453|#821$# I hail from the Winter Lands, in the northerly reaches of the spirit realm. All year long, the snow does not depart from them.|
50454|#823$# As you can tell, I am from the far north.
#822$# When I first appeared in your world, every type of weather felt hot - I was sweating even on nice days!|
50455|#821$# I and my pet Momiji came from a land of ice and snow.
#2$# Yet, oddly enough, he still dislikes the cold. I think he has grown attached to these balmier climes.|
50456|#824$# Although my homeland is ever-blanketed in white, I pray for the kiss of spring to alight upon it one day...|
50461|You sure do like that umbrella, huh?|
50462|What's so special about your umbrella?|
50463|#824$# I promised someone dear to me that, when he returned from his wandering, I would welcome him under this same umbrella.|
50464|#821$# This umbrella is one of my most treasured belongings.
#822$# Wherever I travel, I always take it with me.|
50465|#821$# When one lives in a land of year-round winter, one quickly comes to appreciate a quality umbrella.
#822$# It would not do to have my clothes dampened by snow, would it?|
50466|#822$# The cherry blossoms on my umbrella serve as a reminder.
#824$# They remind me of my desire to see the cherry trees in my hometown blossom one day.|
50471|Sometimes it looks like something's got you down...|
50472|Did something sad happen in your past?|
50473|#821$# I do appreciate your concern for my well-being. Right now, I am doing fine.|
50474|#822$# Oh? It must just be the paleness of my face. Do not be worried for my sake.|
50475|#824$# I was thinking of how I once made a promise... A promise that could only be fulfilled when spring comes to my homeland.|
50476|#824$# I...do not feel like discussing the past right now. Perhaps at a later time...|
50481|Do you have friends you really trust?|
50482|Who's your best friend?|
50483|#824$# Where I come from, I have fans of my music, and many admirers besides, but sadly, none I can call a friend...|
50484|#823$# Other than Momiji here...just you, I suppose.
#2$# At least one of you doesn't constantly crawl around inside my clothes.|
50485|#821$# I was closest to my pipe fox, Momiji - so I brought him with me when I came here.
#2$# See? He seems quite pleased with your realm.|
50486|#823$# Acquaintences without number, yes, but there are few I would call "friends".
#821$# And yourself? I would like to meet your friends someday.|
50491|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
50492|What would you do if we separated?|
50493|#822$# I have always known that one day we would have to say goodbye, but I will not forget your many kindnesses to me.
#824$# I would hope that you, too, keep a warm memory of me in your heart, in spite of my cold.|
50494|#821$# When we must say our last goodbyes, I will dance an ancient dance of prayer for you,
#824$# so that the will of the spirits might always look kindly upon your path.|
50495|#824$# Even if we are separated, I will think of you whenever I sing the ballad I wrote chronicling our adventures.|
50496|#824$# I will wait for the day when warm breezes bring the touch of spring to my homeland. Such a day will be a day of rejoicing for me.|
50601|What is your dream?|
50602|Do you have a dream?|
50603|#824$#Don't be afraid if I tell you...
#821$# My dream is to fly to the sun, and get as close as I can to the Aura Kingdom!|
50604|#821$# Of course I have dreams! People have to have dreams!|
50605|#821$# My dream almost came true once. I was so close to the sun I could almost touch it...
#824$# But then I heard an alarm: "Warning! System Overheating! Catastrophic Failure!"
#821$#The sun's heat nearly destroyed me, and my former master fell and died.|
50606|#821$# Flying! I want to soar through the sky, and feel the unbearable heat of the sun!|
50611|Who do you have feelings for?|
50612|Who do you like?|
50613|#821$# That kind of pointless thing means nothing to me. My dream trumps all!|
50614|#824$# Is this more important than my dream? If not, why are we still talking about it?|
50615|#822$# I like you! You're my companion, so of course I like you!|
50616|#821$# Until my dream comes true, I'd rather not talk about it.|
50621|What is your favorite food?|
50622|What do you normally eat?|
50623|#821$# C'mon! Use your brain!
#824$# Look at me! Do you really think I still need to eat?|
50624|#821$# Before I became like this, I liked Crispy Roasted Chicken and Flavorful Herbal Tea!
#822$# Sadly, if I eat those now, my robot body will be damaged.
#821$# But hey, even if I'm just a robot, it's still good to be alive.|
50625|#821$# In my current state, I can only eat things like Eidolon XP Crystals.
#821$# If I eat anything else, I might end up in a repair shop.
#824$# Maybe someday I can be made into a robot that can eat real food...|
50626|#821$# My favorite food is... people!
#822$# Ha! Relax, I'm just messing with you. Why would I eat people?
#823$# You should have seen how scared you looked!|
50631|What's your favorite season?|
50632|Which season do you like best?|
50633|#821$# They're pretty much the same to me, though I do hate rain.
#824$# It's not that big of a deal, but until I get more waterproof parts, I may get rusty if I get too wet.
#821$# I might as well be dead if I'm too rusty to move!|
50634|#821$# Real men don't care what season it is.|
50635|#824$# I can't feel heat or cold, so the seasons are all pretty much the same to me.|
50636|#824$# Why should I care what season it is? I just live my life.
#821$# I spend every day working toward my dreams!|
50641|Do you have a favorite animal?|
50642|What do you think of animals?|
50643|#821$# I like hawks. The way they soar through the sky is a sight to behold!|
50644|#821$# Promise you won't laugh... I kinda like little birds.
#824$# Though it does bother me a bit when they build their nests on my body...|
50645|#821$# I like strong animals! Why? Because strong means more meat!
#823$# I was kidding. You should've seen the look on your face!|
50646|#821$# I used to keep small animals, like squirrels and foxes, as pets...
#824$# But I don't keep pets anymore - it's too hard to wash their hair.|
50651|Have you heard of the Aura Kingdom?|
50652|What's the Aura Kingdom like?|
50653|#824$# I've heard the Aura Kingdom is different from Terra. For one thing, it's unrestrained by the shackles of time.
#821$# The angels don't get old - they look the same forever.|
50654|#824$# The Aura Kingdom... That's somewhere humans can never go.
#821$# My dream is to fly to the sun, and get as close as I can to the Aura Kingdom!|
50655|#824$# No one from Terra has ever been to the Aura Kingdom. Even angels who come to Terra by mistake can't go back.
#821$# You shouldn't have such unrealistic dreams, they'll only make you sad.|
50656|#824$# The Aura Kingdom is said to be beautiful. The trees stay green forever, and the flowers never die.
#821$# Wait, trees that stay green? Those sound like artificial trees! My old man used to make those!|
50661|What can you tell me about the Avians?|
50662|I'd like to know more about the Avians.|
50663|#821$# A foolish race that gave up flying!|
50664|#821$# They could've flown, but they chose to walk on their feet!
#824$# Stupid, stupid! They don't deserve their wings!|
50665|#821$# Sad creatures... they have wings, but have forgotten how to fly.|
50666|#821$# Avians? They can't fly and have bad tempers. What are you asking about them for?|
50671|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
50672|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
50673|#824$# Everyone says the Cube of Gaia created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium, but who was the first to say it?
#821$# Don't you think people's beliefs about the Cube of Gaia are a bit strange?|
50674|#821$# It's just a cube, yet it creates life.
#821$# Don't you find that magical?|
50675|#821$# The Cube of Gaia saved my life once.
#824$# I don't remember it, but my dad told me that, when I was young, I was gravely injured in an accident.
#821$# He used the cube's energy and his mechanical skills to save me. That's how I became what I am today.|
50676|#821$# The Cube of Gaia created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium, as well as all the creatures living in those realms.
#821$# But where did this all-powerful cube come from? No one knows.|
50681|What's the point of joining a guild?|
50682|What are your thoughts on guilds?|
50683|#821$# Well, you get to to fight alongside like-minded people. Just thinking about it makes me excited!|
50684|#821$# Each guild has its own Hall, where you can find various merchants.
#821$# Also, strangely, various Eidolons will appear frequently in the Guild Halls.
#824$# I don't get it, showing up just to be beaten. Who knows what those Eidolons are thinking?|
50685|#821$# There's also a Guild Warehouse in each Guild Hall. You can use it as a trash can.
#822$# If someone has a problem with that, just tell them I told you it was okay to throw trash there. Haha!|
50686|#821$# Traveling alone is boring. If you join a guild, you'll have more friends.|
50691|I'd like to know more about Dragon Points.|
50692|What can you tell me about Dragon Points?|
50693|#821$# Well, it's just another name for the energy of the Cube of Gaia.|
50694|#824$# How could you not know about that? Go bother someone else with these dumb questions!|
50695|#821$# Once you collect enough Dragon Points, you can create certain items.
#821$# Creating something from nothing - ain't that amazing!|
50696|#821$# Stronger creatures have the Cube of Gaia's energy in them. And this type of energy is called Dragon Points.|
50701|You weren't always a robot. What happened?|
50702|How did you become a robot?|
50703|#821$# Well, this is my dad's greatest creation! He built me like this with help from the Power of Gaia.
#821$# But why a robot? You'll have to ask my dad about that.
#824$# After all, I was dying when it happened, so I didn't have much of a say in the matter.|
50704|#824$# The last thing that I do remember is the system warning: "System Overheating! Catastrophic Failure!"
#821$#After my master died, I was so sad. I gave up on life, and nearly died too.
#821$# But with help from the Power of Gaia, my master's memories and behavior patterns were cloned, and I regained the will to live.|
50705|#824$# Well... it was an accident. I don't remember it, I've only heard about it from my dad.
#821$# He told me that I was dying. My injury was so severe that it couldn't be cured.
#821$# He used the cube's energy and his mechanical skill to build this body for me.|
50706|#821$# Long story short... there was an accident.|
50711|Do you ever need to rest?|
50712|Do you ever need to sleep?|
50713|#821$# Not really - but out of habit, I still take a nap every day.|
50714|#824$# I suppose I could live without sleeping, but it would be very strange.|
50715|#821$# C'mon! Use your brain!
#824$# Look at me! Do you really think I still need to sleep?|
50716|#822$# Have you ever seen a sleeping robot? What a dumb question! Haha!|
50721|Daedalus is a famous architect!|
50722|Daedalus is a famous inventor!|
50723|#821$# My old man is amazing! Have you heard of Minotaurus's labyrinth? My dad built it!|
50724|#821$# Of course he is! He also built my robot body.
#821$# A perfect combination of the Power of Gaia and mechanical skill saved my life. How many people could do what my dad did?|
50725|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$# ...He has a wealth of knowledge, innovative ideas, and the ability to put those ideas into action.
#821$# I was created to help my master achieve his dreams.|
50726|#821$# It's true! Thanks for speaking highly of my dad.|
50731|What do you think of Minotaurus?|
50732|Do you know Minotaurus?|
50733|#824$# Before I met him, I thought he was just a weirdo with horns.
#821$# But later I found out he and I actually have a lot in common. Hahaha!|
50734|#824$# You mean the guy who paid my dad a fortune to build a labyrinth?
#821$# I don't get it. Who'd want to live in a labyrinth? Isn't he afraid he'll get lost in his own home?
#821$# After all, my dad built that labyrinth, and even he almost got lost in there!|
50735|#824$# I heard that Minotaurus doesn't allow anyone to ride on his back... which really makes me want to try it.|
50736|#821$# Word has it that Minotaurus has his own army inside the labyrinth...
#822$# I wonder if they ever get lost in there. That would be funny!|
50741|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
50742|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
50743|#821$# Don't underestimate Alucard just because he looks frail. He's actually a dragon!
#821$# I once saw him turn into a dragon and take flight - that was truly amazing!|
50744|#824$# Aelius is the God of the Sun... But since Aelius is here with us, who's the sun in the sky?|
50745|#821$# Bealdor is the God of Light and Aelius is the God of the Sun...
#824$# Doesn't the sun bring the light? What exactly is the difference between them?|
50746|#821$# I heard that Shirayuki lives in the Winter Lands, where it's always snowing.
#821$# I've never seen snow before. I hope I can see it someday!|
50751|Do you miss Daedalus?|
50752|I heard Daedalus misses you a lot.|
50753|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$# ...Even though I contain my master's memories and behavior patterns human feelings are foreign to me.
#821$# Missing someone... I could never understand this feeling, nor have I ever felt it.|
50754|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$# ...Missing someone? I'm afraid I do not know this feeling.
#821$# But I do sometimes replay Daedalus's videos. Is that what you'd call "missing?"|
50755|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$ ...Daedalus misses my master's memories and behavior patterns, not me...
#824$# Am I sad? I think you misinterpret - these aren't tears, it's just machine oil...|
50756|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$#¡K My chip seems to be partially damaged, so the videos of Daedalus sometimes play automatically even when I don't want to.
#824$# You call this "missing"? I don't think so. It's just a damaged chip. I'd never have human's feelings.|
50761|Do you cry?|
50762|Have you ever cried?|
50763|#821$# Real men don't cry. I wouldn't mind bleeding, but I'll never cry!|
50764|#824$# These aren't tears. They're... what do you call it... cleaning fluid?|
50765|#821$# I was a very bad kid. And I used to cry my eyes out when my dad yelled at me!
#824$# But now? I'm a man, for god's sake! 
#821$# And even if I did cry I'd never tell anyone - it would be so humiliating.|
50766|#821$# Speaking of which, the only time I saw my dad cry was when I nearly died.
#821$# When I woke up, he didn't know how to react, but soon he started crying.
#824$# Maybe those were happy tears? I'm not sure, but I have a feeling they were.|
50771|Why were you created?|
50772|Why did Daedalus create you?|
50773|#824$# Create? Oh, you mean my body.
#821$# To save my life! My old body was destroyed; only my brain was intact.
#821$# I gotta hand it to my dad - saving me when I was in that condition. Haha!|
50774|#1$# Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#821$ ...My former master's dream was to fly to the sun and get as close as possible to the Aura Kingdom!
#824$# Daedalus created me to help my master achieve his dreams.|
50775|#822$# Haha! That's an interesting way to put it. But you may be right - I was basically "created" by my dad.|
50776|#821$# You're right! Giving birth is also a kind of creation.|
50781|What type of energy do you run on?|
50782|Do you need to recharge your energy?|
50783|#821$# Must you ask? The Cube of Gaia's energy, of course!|
50784|#821$# You forgot what my dad used to make me? It was the Cube of Gaia!|
50785|#821$# Haha! Don't underestimate me - I have the Cube of Gaia's energy inside me!
#824$# If the Cube's energy runs out, I'm afraid I'll shut down permanently.|
50786|#821$# You've gotta hand it to my dad - not everyone could have harnessed the Cube of Gaia's energy.
#821$# The Cube created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium, so imagine how powerful it is!
#821$# I'm pretty sure you don't need to worry about my energy running out.|
50791|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
50792|What would you do if we separated?|
50793|#822$# Haha! Don't you worry...
#821$# Even if we part ways, I'm sure we'll meet again someday!|
50794|#821$# To pursue my dream! That's the whole point of living!|
50795|#821$# Have you heard the saying "we'll cross that bridge when we come to it"?
#821$# Let's not worry about that yet, it won't do us any good.|
50796|#821$# I'd love to visit my dad... I wonder if his hair has turned grey.|
50901|Do you like to travel?|
50902|How do you feel about traveling?|
50903|#821$# I love traveling, and looking at all the beautiful scenery!
#822$# I like traveling as much as I like you!|
50904|#822$# I like traveling, but sometimes I can't find my way back to Hellheim.
#821$# Gram used to find me when I got lost...
#824$# I miss him so much...|
50905|#821$# Aren't we traveling right now? Or would you not call this traveling?
#823$# Or maybe... Is this what my brother would call eloping?|
50906|#822$# I love traveling with you!
#821$# What about you? Do you like traveling with me?|
50911|What kind of person do you like?|
50912|What kind of person would you want to date?|
50913|#821$# My oldest brother wants me to date someone smart; my second-oldest brother wants me to date someone strong; and my father says...
#824$# He says... actually he's said a lot of things... I can't remember them now.
#821$# But my second oldest brother told me that I should just ignore my dad. So I guess that only leaves the first two conditions.|
50914|#823$#Gram says he'll find me whenever I get lost and take me back to Hellheim, 
#821$# he also says he'll convince my dad and my brothers, 
#821$# he also says... Huh? You don't want to hear any more? But there's still so much I want to tell you...|
50915|#821$# I like Gram, and my two brothers... My father? Uh...
#824$# If my my father gave me more freedom, I'd like him more.
#822$# Ah, I also like you! You're like my big brother!|
50916|#821$# Hmm... The things I like are shiny and cold...
#821$# You mean the people I like? I like snowmen!|
50921|What's your favorite color?|
50922|Any preferences about color?|
50923|#821$# Black, red, yellow, purple... I like them all...
#823$# But my favorite color is shining gold!|
50924|#2$# Well... Should I dye myself so we're the same color?
#821$# Your face looks so red. Are you unwell?
#824$# My second-oldest brother said that this would make you happy. He didn't tell me that you might get sick.|
50925|#822$# What color do I like? I like your color!|
50926|#821$# Uhh... Let's just say I do NOT like your color...
#824$# It kinda reminds me of my second-oldest brother's vomit. I don't like it.|
50931|What's your favorite season?|
50932|Which season do you like best?|
50933|#821$# We don't have seasons in Hellheim. The weather is always the same...|
50934|#823$# I like all four seasons in Terra, and their different sceneries.
#821$# Flowers in spring, summer breezes, falling leaves in autumn and snow in winter - I like them all!|
50935|#823$# Gram always hated winter.
#821$# A lot of people die every winter, so it's always busy.
#821$# Gram always complains about how much he works in the winter.|
50936|#823$ Hmm... My second-oldest brother also hates winter.
#821$# He says that he always feel exhausted during winter - all he wants to do is go find a warm place to sleep.|
50941|Do you have a favorite animal?|
50942|What do you think of animals?|
50943|#821$# I like deer, wild boars and pheasant - they're all delicious!
#821$# Oh, you didn't mean to eat? Then what was your question again?|
50944|#821$# Gram once had a huge ox twice his size.
#824$# Then, one day, my oldest brother came to visit, and we never saw the ox again.
#821$# I still remember how happy my oldest brother was that day.|
50945|#2$# If you were my pet, I could discipline you...
#821$# Not interested? But my second-oldest brother told me it would make you happy...|
50946|#821$# Gram once had a beautiful golden python.
#824$# Then, one day, my second-oldest brother came to visit, and we never saw the python again.
#821$# My second-oldest brother was so angry when he left.|
50951|What's the Sky Tower like?|
50952|Have you heard of the Sky Tower?|
50953|#821$# It's the tallest building in Navea. Word is, it has 100 floors!|
50954|#822$# I wonder what it's like inside the Sky Tower. Let's go have a look together!|
50955|#821$# I hear that there's a mystical potion at the very top of the Sky Tower that can cure any illness.
#823$# I never thought humans could make such an amazing potion. I'm impressed!|
50956|#821$# Hmm... I've heard there's lots of weapons and armor inside the Sky Tower.
#821$# If you want some new equipment, you should go have a look!|
50961|What's the Cube of Gaia?|
50962|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
50963|#821$# You don't know? The Cube of Gaia is what created the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium.|
50964|#823$# I don't know... You should ask Gram, I'm sure he knows.
#824$# ¡K Ah, I forgot again... Gram is gone...|
50965|#821$# The Cube of Gaia created everything. So it's fair to say the cube is the mother of all of us...
#822$# If you think about it that way, you and I are siblings!|
50966|#821$# Lots of people want to use the Cube of Gaia's power for evil...
#823$# Just like the other Envoy of Gaia you were chasing, remember?
#821$# It was that guy with white hair who always wears black and rides a black horse!|
50971|What's the Mirabelle Group?|
50972|Have you heard of the Mirabelle Group?|
50973|#821$# Hmm... If I recall correctly, the Mirabelle Group is a "problem-solving" agency.|
50974|#821$# There are Mirabelle Group Bulletin Boards in nearly every town and village.
#821$# If you're feeling up to it, you should help out some people in need!|
50975|#821$# Hmm... All the Mirabelle Group's customers seem to be young humans... 
#821$# That used to give me the impression that young humans were frail and helpless. But now, I know that's not the case!|
50976|#824$# Uh... I remember Gram once said...
#821$# The Mirabelle Group is an agency that "dumps" people's problems onto other people...
#824$# That's not true? But Gram told me so...|
50981|What's "Connecting to Gaia"?|
50982|What purpose does "Connecting to Gaia" serve?|
50983|#821$# Hmm... According to Gram, it involves me asking the Cube of Gaia for gifts.|
50984|#824$# Connecting to Gaia is a wonderful feeling. Mmm... I don't know how to explain it...
#821$# Once you become an Eidolon you'll see for yourself!|
50985|#2$# What, do you want to connect to me?
#821$# Eh? Your nose is bleeding... Is blood the present the Cube of Gaia gave you?|
50986|#821$# "Connecting to Gaia" is achieving resonance with the Cube of Gaia and creating items from the cube's energy.
#824$# But, sadly, I never get what I want...|
50991|What's "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
50992|Have you heard of "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
50993|#824$# Gram told me once. Let me think...
#821$# ... Oh, right! He said "Tanuki Turmoil" is when humans get involved in the affairs of mice, instead of minding their own business.|
50994|#821$# Uhh... If I recall correctly, it's two different groups of mice fighting over giant corn.
#823$# The huge, golden corn always looks so beautiful. I bet it's also delicious!|
50995|#821$# Not just Gram, but also my second-oldest brother, said that!
#821$# He said, "If I could just try that corn, all my troubles would cease."|
50996|#822$# I'm not sure... Why don't you check it out and see for yourself!|
51001|Who's Gram?|
51002|Tell me about Gram.|
51003|#821$# Gram is family. He's the person I love most. Then it's my second-oldest brother, then my oldest brother and my father.|
51004|#821$# Gram was always there for me, even after I went to Hellheim.
#824$# I thought it would be always like that - Gram and me together. But he's gone...
#824$# I miss him so much...|
51005|#821$# It's not just me - my brothers also like Gram.
#823$# Every time they come visit, they hang out with him a lot!
#821$# It's strange, though - Gram always looks so tired after they leave.|
51006|#821$# Gram is actually a sword, but in the form of a dragon.
#821$# But, sword or dragon, it doesn't matter: Gram is family to me and I love him the most!|
51011|What's Hellheim like?|
51012|Tell me about Hellheim.|
51013|#821$# It's a land of lost souls. It's dark and gloomy. I doubt humans would like it much...
#821$# Even I didn't like it at first... Luckily, I got Gram for company.|
51014|#821$# Picture the darkest, gloomiest and most desolate place you can imagine - that's Hellheim.|
51015|#821$# It's a gloomy and desolate place with nothing to see.
#823$# But regardless, Hellheim is my home, and I like it there.|
51016|#821$# Hmm... According to Gram, it's just a desolate wasteland of bones.|
51021|Do you know Bealdor?|
51022|Bealdor always wanted to meet you.|
51023|#824$# Bealdor... If I hadn't met him, maybe Gram wouldn't be...|
51024|#821$# The God of Light? Of course I know him!
#824$# After all, everyone loves the light and hates darkness...|
51025|#824$# Bealdor... I'm not sure if I should see him again.
#824$# I just miss Gram so much...|
51026|#824$# If I could turn back time, maybe... maybe I would do things differently...|
51031|Can dead people be revived?|
51032|Can you revive a dead person?|
51033|#821$# Whoever or whatever you are, dead is dead. Nothing can change that.|
51034|#823$# Hmm... I remember it clearly: some lost souls were complaining about being dead. Gram scolded them harshly...
#821$# He yelled, "Shut the hell up and get back in line, or I'll make you suffer!"
#823$# I still remember how well those lost souls behaved after that...|
51035|#821$# Well, being alive again is out of the question, but you can still live in Hellheim, which isn't so bad...
#822$# When the time comes, I'll find you a nice spot in Hellheim!|
51036|#821$# Hmm... if Gram is right and we can be revived, what do we need Hellheim for??|
51041|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
51042|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
51043|#821$# Vayu and Gram look so alike... Only Vayu is whiter... 
#822$# Hmm... Do you know where we could find some black dye?|
51044|#821$# Alucard and Vayu are both dragons, but they look so different.
#823$# I guess I like Vayu better, because he looks like Gram!|
51045|#821$# I like Endora... Her blonde hair is amazing!
#821$# Justine is also super-cute. Too bad Endora never lets me touch her...|
51046|#821$# Shirayuki, from the Winter Lands? I wonder how she tastes...
#823$# Maybe like a snowman?|
51051|I heard you have two brothers?|
51052|Do you have any siblings?|
51053|#821$# I have three siblings. The oldest is Ayako, the second-oldest is Jormungand, and Gram is like a brother as well!|
51054|#821$# Fenrir loves training with Gram. But every time they do, they leave Hellheim a mess.
#823$# Fortunately, Jormungand always shows up and makes sure Fenrir cleans up.
#821$# Jormungand is the best! Whenever Fenrir gets into trouble, Jormungand is there for him.|
51055|#821$# And don't forget Gram - he's also my brother.
#821$# Gram always says he's just a servant. But in my heart, he is my brother!|
51056|#823$# Sometimes I wish I had a sister too...
#821$# Don't let my two brothers know about that... They might get upset.|
51061|You and crows both like shiny things.|
51062|Why do you and crows share the same interest?|
51063|#821$# An Eidolon once made similar comments...
#823$# My two brothers happened to hear the comments, and invited him over for a chat. 
#821$# Strangely, I haven't seen that Eidolon since...|
51064|#824$# Sadly, there are no crows in Hellheim... 
#821$# Could crows be the same as carrion birds? But carrion birds don't like shiny things...|
51065|#821$# I feel a strange kinship with crows.
#823$# I have lots of shiny things I could share with them!|
51066|#822$# Shiny things are the best! Don't you agree?|
51071|What are the duties of the Netherworld Queen?|
51072|What does the Netherworld Queen do?|
51073|#821$# Hmm... Manage Hellheim, deal with the Lost Souls, serve the oldest and second-oldest brothers, go out and enjoy the view...
#823$# Uh, I think the last few don't count. Oops!|
51074|#824$# Sigh... the lost souls are always so dark and gloomy. They're not pretty at all.
#821$# Watching at lost souls all day is pretty boring.|
51075|#821$# When Gram was around, I'd just go for a walk and he'd find me.
#824$# But Gram is gone. I really miss him...|
51076|#824$# Hellheim without Gram is so big and gloomy...|
51081|You're pretty skilled!|
51082|What sort of training do you do?|
51083|#821$# Normally, Gram helps me train.
#821$# I don't know why, but every time we train, he always wears a lot of heavy-looking equipment.
#823$# I always help him take off the equipment after we're done, and he always looks at me gratefully.|
51084|#824$# I used to have Gram to train with. Sadly, he's gone now...|
51085|#821$# At first, I trained with my second-oldest brother. After awhile he got too busy, so I trained with my oldest brother.
#821$# But then my oldest brother also said he was too busy, so I started training with Gram.
#823$#Well, even though my brothers are both busy, they still visit me a lot!|
51086|#821$# Sigh... my brothers are even more skilled than I am!
#821$# Every time we train together, they always let me win. I think they just do it to make me happy.
#823$# They've always been so nice to me. I love them both!|
51091|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
51092|What would you do if we separated?|
51093|#821$# Hmm... Go back to Hellheim? I don't know...|
51094|#821$# Don't worry, I'm sure we will meet again.
#822$# Why? Because all dead people come to Hellheim. I will be waiting for you.|
51095|#821$# I have to visit my second-oldest brother first, then my oldest brother.
#824$# My father? He has so many rules - you can't wear this, you can't sit like that, you can't this and that...
#823$# Maybe I'll visit my father next time...|
51096|#821$# Leaving... like how Gram left me? Forever?
#824$# I don't know... I really don't know...|
51201|What's your favorite color?|
51202|What's your favorite color?|
51203|#823$# Definitely the bright ones. Come on, I'm the God of Light!|
51204|#821$# I used to hate darkness, until I met her...
#821$# She made me stop hating the darkness, and I even started liking it.
#824$# But she never visits me anymore...|
51205|#821$# Color? I like your color.
#822$# What? No, no! I just like it, it has nothing to do with you! I repeat, it's not because of you!|
51206|#821$# Uh... I don't really love or hate any color. How about you?
#822$# Don't get me wrong, I was just asking. Not... not because I care about you!|
51211|Do you like to travel?|
51212|What do you think about traveling?|
51213|#821$# If I didn't like traveling, why would I be traveling with you...?
#822$# I... I meant I like traveling for its own sake. No, not you! Only the traveling!|
51214|#821$# Traveling... I've promised someone I'll travel the world with her.
#824$# But it feels like that day may never come...|
51215|#821$# I always thought traveling was dangerous... My mother was so worried about me.
#822$# Eventually, I came to realize that traveling isn't as scary as my mother told me.
#821$# My mother is always scared that bad things will happen to me... She worries too much.|
51216|#822$# Traveling is great, but my mother is always checking in on me, which can be annoying...
#821$# Ah! Never repeat what I just said! Do you copy?|
51221|What is your favorite food?|
51222|Do you have a preference in food?|
51223|#821$# I've never eaten anything from Terra. My mother always worried about Terran food.|
51224|#821$# Hmm... I don't really have a favorite food. I don't really care what I eat.|
51225|#821$# That thing you're always eating!
#822$# It's just a coincidence; it's not... not because you like it...|
51226|#823$# Everything in Terra seems to be edible. The creatures of Terra are amazing!|
51231|What's your definition of a friend?|
51232|What makes a friend?|
51233|#821$# She taught me what friends are for. But maybe, now, she wishes she'd never known me...|
51234|#821$# Aren't we friends? Or... you don't consider me a friend?
#822$# It's fine if we're not friends. I... I don't care. I don't care at all!|
51235|#821$# Well, I think it should be someone who can share the good times and the bad times with you.
#824$# Why that look? Go an ask another Eidolon, then!|
51236|#821$# Friends... like Endora and Merrilee?
#821$# Or are they not friends, but rivals?
#822$# I see... it's hard to define "friends."|
51241|What sort of person interests you?|
51242|Who do you have feelings for?|
51243|#821$# I don't know if you'd call it love, but there's someone I think about all the time...
#824$# But she... she doesn't want to see me... ever since that day...|
51244|#821$# What? Why bother to ask? Aren't I here, traveling with you?
#822$# I just mean, because I like to travel, not... not because I like you...|
51245|#821$# Hmm... someone you always want to be with, to travel everywhere with... does that count?
#822$# What you laughing at? I'm not talking about you! I'm not!|
51246|#821$ Her... but she doesn't want to see me anymore. Unless he's back...
#824$# But he'll never come back, ever...|
51251|What's so special about the Sky Tower?|
51252|What can you tell me about the Sky Tower?|
51253|#821$# It's said that the holy medicine at the top of the Sky Tower can cure any disease.
#821$# I didn't expect such a thing in Terra. I wonder what it looks like...|
51254|#821$# The Sky Tower? It sounds interesting...
#822$# No? Well, I don't really want to go either. But if you insist, I... I can do that too.|
51255|#821$# The Sky Tower? I've heard it's full of magical weapons.
#821$# But the weapons of Terra... don't they all break after a while? Or do I have it wrong?|
51256|#821$# It's said that a lot of memories are stored in the Sky Tower. I wonder how that happened...
#822$# I wonder if... if it knows the story of me and her...|
51261|Do you know Pandemonium?|
51262|What is Pandemonium like?|
51263|#824$# It's full of revolting demons. There's nothing to talk about!|
51264|#821$# It's said that Pandemonium is a very dangerous place.
#821$# Anything that could survive there must be pretty tough...|
51265|#821$# Pandemonium is different from Terra: it's unconstrained by the shackles of time. 
#821$# The demons there never die naturally - they just get older and more powerful.|
51266|#822$# It's a desolate place, where only cursed wretches live.|
51271|What do you think of Terra?|
51272|What can you tell me about Terra?|
51273|#821$# The creatures of Terra are fascinating! It doesn't matter whether they're Humans, Makar, or Dwarves.
#821$# How can they do so many things with such short lives?|
51274|#822$# Terra? Well... not so bad! I like traveling it with you.|
51275|#821$# Terra is constrained by the shackles of time. Every living thing will eventually die...
#822$# So, if... if you eventually go too, I won't be sad.
#824$# Maybe just... a bit lonely...|
51276|#821$# You must know Terra better than I do.
#822$# You just wanted to hear me talk? Oh, wow... okay...
#824$# What are you laughing at? That didn't make me happy! Not at all!|
51281|What's "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
51282|Have you heard of "Tanuki Turmoil"?|
51283|#821$# It's an epic battle between two groups of mice.
#824$# What are you laughing at? Did I say something funny?|
51284|#821$# Humans are so strange. A battle between mice has nothing to do with you.
#821$# Who cares which side wins, right?
#824$# How could it possibly matter? Humans are so weird...|
51285|#821$# I believe it's... a war between mice trying to get food for the winter?
#821$# I just don't get it. Why even bother getting involved in a mouse battle?|
51286|#822$# A mouse battle? Sounds interesting...
#824$# What? No, I'm not interested. Well, maybe a little... just a little...|
51291|What's the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
51292|What can you tell me about the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
51293|#822$# How did you ever get by without me?
#821$# The Aura Kingdom Quiz is an event in Navea, that's all.
#824$# Hey! Why are you looking at me like that? If you don't believe me, go ask the other Eidolons!|
51294|#821$# It's a competition held in the Garden of Revelations by Major Gerald.
#821$# I've heard some special guests might participate... But I have no idea who they are.|
51295|#821$# It seems to be a competition made up of various kinds of questions.
#821$# Sounds fun - why don't you participate?
#824$# Me? No, I don't want to go! I do not want to go at all!|
51296|#821$# It sounds like... a competition! Why don't you go and participate, and find out for yourself!|
51301|Do you know Hel?|
51302|Do you know the Netherworld Queen?|
51303|#823$# Ah, yes... the infamous Netherworld Queen. Is there anybody who hasn't heard of her?|
51304|#821$# Hel... I wonder if she still remembers me...
#824$# Well, I think it's pretty hard for her to forget about you, since you took away the most important person in her life...|
51305|#821$# She may be beautiful, but her mind is broken. Try as she might, she can't remember the way back to Hellheim.
#821$# Every time Hel gets lost, Gram finds her.
#824$# Gram... If not for me, Gram wouldn't be...|
51306|#821$# Hel... I haven't seen her in ages. I wonder how she's doing...|
51311|Your hair is shimmering. You look gorgeous!|
51312|I love your hair!|
51313|#822$# I'm not happy just because you praised me. Not at all!|
51314|#821$# Hel said something similar once...|
51315|#821$# Thanks! Yours isn't bad either...
#824$# I did not get shy because you praised me! I didn't!|
51316|#823$# Tell me about it! Come on, I'm the God of Light!|
51321|What is your mother like?|
51322|I've heard your mother is very beautiful.|
51323|#821$# My mother is the ruler of sky and land. Of all the goddesses, she is the greatest!|
51324|#821$# My mother loves me very much. She takes care of everything for me.
#821$# If I have nightmares, she always makes me feel better...|
51325|#824$# My mother always treats me like a little kid. It can get pretty annoying...
#821$# Wait! Don't... don't tell anyone what I just said!|
51326|#822$# What? You don't know? Your lack of knowledge is surprising...|
51331|What are the duties of the God of Light?|
51332|What does the God of Light do?|
51333|#821$# To bring light to the world, so that all creatures can bask in its splendor.|
51334|#821$# To illuminate the paths of all creatures, so that they can travel in the light.|
51335|#822$# It's very simple. You don't know? Oh my...
#821$# Why are you looking at me? I'm not gonna tell you!
#821$# Even if you keep asking I'll never tell you! No!|
51336|#824$# You really don't know? Why am I traveling with you?|
51341|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
51342|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
51343|#821$# Everytime Alucard sees me, he laughs strangely... Do I look funny?|
51344|#821$# Hel... I've done something unforgivable to her.
#824$# If I could choose again, maybe... perhaps it would have been better if we'd never met.|
51345|#821$# Supposedly, Aelius wronged Serena in some way, and is always asking her for forgiveness.
#821$# I think I understand how Aelius feels.|
51346|#821$# Every time I talk to Eligos, he's so arrogant.
#824$# He's just Eligos. Why is he so arrogant? Such overconfidence!|
51351|I heard that all living things have made a vow to not harm you.|
51352|I've heard that nothing on can hurt you.|
51353|#822$# I once dreamt about the death, and my mother became very worried.
#821$# After that, my mother made every living thing vow not to hurt me - well, every living thing except mistletoe.|
51354|#821$# Even though I can't be hurt physically, I can still be hurt mentally...|
51355|#823$# Even without the vow, I'm not sure what could hurt me!|
51356|#823$# Oh, I didn't expect you to know that. Not bad!|
51361|What do you regret most?|
51362|What's the worst thing you've ever done?|
51363|#821$# My ignorance caused me to lose my friend... Hel...|
51364|#821$# Because of my ignorance, I... I took a life.
#824$# It was someone very important to her...|
51365|#822$# Why would you ask that? It's none of your business!
#821$# Uhh... Are you angry?
#824$# I... I'll tell you next time. But not because you got angry...|
51366|#822$# Traveling with you!
#821$# Hey, don't... don't cry! I was joking! Joking!
#824$# You aren't crying? I thought you were! I... I wasn't worried! No!|
51371|Your scarf looks pretty good!|
51372|Your scarf looks very delicate!|
51373|#822$# This was made by my mother. It's the only one in the world!|
51374|#822$# This scarf can not only keep you warm, it can also keep you cool.
#821$# But I'm not afraid of cold or heat. My mother worries too much...|
51375|#821$# This is a gift from my mother. It seems to be windproof, rainproof and... dustproof?
#821$# My mother is always worried about me. She tends to overthink about what might hurt me.
#824$# It can get pretty annoying... Ah! Don't... don't repeat what I just said!|
51376|#821$# Of course! It was a gift from my mother.
#824$# What are you laughing at? I didn't... didn't get happy just because you praised me!|
51381|Tell me about your sword!|
51382|Let's talk about your sword!|
51383|#821$# Don't call him "your sword"! He's my partner, Skee!|
51384|#822$# Skee is no ordinary sword. He's made from the light of the first dawn!|
51385|#821$# This is Skee. He's my best and only friend...
#821$# Skee wil never leave or be harmed because of my ignorance.
#824$# You... what are you looking at? I wasn't crying! This is sweat! It's sweat!|
51386|#821$##821$ This is Skee. He's accompanied me every since I was born, and always will.|
51391|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
51392|What would you do if we separated?|
51393|#821$# Even if we part, the light will still shine on you.
#824$# Don't... don't get me wrong. I'd just be doing my duty, I wouldn't be worried about you...|
51394|#821$# I... I would like to go back to Hellheim again. Maybe, just maybe, Hel will want to see me again...
#824$# If she still doesn't want to see me... At least I tried!
#821$# At least, then, I might not feel so sad.|
51395|#821$# Say goodbye? You... you're leaving me?
#824$# If you want to go, just go! I... I won't be sad!
#822$# I won't be sad... maybe just... a bit lonely...|
51396|#821$# I'd return to the skies, to perform the duties of God of Light.|
51501|Do you have a preference in food?|
51502|What do you like to eat?|
51503|#821$# Don't worry about it - human food doesn't really work for me.|
51504|#821$# I don't like the creatures with scales - it reminds me of my dragon form.|
51505|#822$# Whatever you offer me, I will gladly accept.|
51506|#822$# You don't like fish? Good, I don't like fish either.|
51511|What's your strongest memory?|
51512|What's your most unforgettable experience?|
51513|#821$# Meeting you!|
51514|#821$# I once met someone who made me understand the meaning of life.
#822$# He promised me we'd will go on an adventure together when he grew up.
#821$# But human beings are just too weak - he got sick and died, and we never got to travel together.|
51515|#821$# Compared to you and other humans, I've lived such a long time.
#821$# Time takes away a lot of things: youth, vigor, life... and memory.
#822$# A lot of things that you thnk you'll remember forever are eventually forgotten.|
51516|#821$# I can clearly remember your face when you first saw me as a dragon!|
51521|What do I do when I run into a strong enemy?|
51522|Tell me the best strategy for facing a powerful enemy.|
51523|#821$# Ha! Not many people dare fight me. I wouldn't worry about it!|
51524|#821$# Whatever kind of enemy, I will fight by your side.|
51525|#824$# With me here, why worry?|
51526|#822$# This reminds me of the first time we fought together...
#821$# I was surprised, because your skills are the best I've ever seen in a human.|
51531|Do you have a favorite animal?|
51532|What do you think of animals?|
51533|#821$# All creatures are the same to me.|
51534|#821$# Humans are complicated creatures.
#821$# They have the potential to do  such good or evil.
#822$# Humans... they're never boring.|
51535|#821$# Animals just do their thing - they don't care what I think.|
51536|#822$# I've seen humans feed and care for animals sometimes.
#821$# These creatures lose their wild nature, and become tame.
#821$# Is that what humans like? I just don't get it.|
51541|What do you think it means to be powerful?|
51542|What is strength to you?|
51543|#824$# Power? My whole existence is power!|
51544|#821$# Ever since I was born, I've been the most powerful of creatures.
#824$# Power is me. I am power.|
51545|#821$# The law of the jungle: kill or be killed.|
51546|#822$# Humans believe that power is not only in the body, but also in the heart and soul.
#821$# A human told me this once. Do you agree?|
51551|What are your thoughts on the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium?|
51552|What do you think of the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium?|
51553|#821$# Terra is a blessed place.
#823$# The way Terra changes over time makes it very beautiful.|
51554|#822$# Pandemonium... is similar to a place I once lived.|
51555|#821$# I heard that there are angels and creatures with white wings in the Aura Kingdom.
#822$# White wings... something I hate also has white wings...
#824$# ...something covering up a massacre, all in the name of justice...|
51556|#821$# Compared to those in the Aura Kingdom and Pandemonium, the creatures of Terra are tiny.
#822$# But the creatures in Terra give off the most dazzling light.|
51561|What do you think the Cube of Gaia is?|
51562|Tell me about the Cube of Gaia.|
51563|#822$# ... You don't know what Cube of Gaia is? That's surprising...
#821$# Your knowledge of things seems a bit shaky!|
51564|#821$# I heard that this dimension was created by the Cube of Gaia.
#822$# This makes me very curious. If the Cube doesn't have consciousness, how does it make life?
#821$# Or maybe someone used the Cube of Gaia to create the Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium...|
51565|#821$# It's made of powerful energy. It takes a strong being to bear this energy.|
51566|#822$# This mysterious Cube of Gaia... its energy feels familiar.
#821$# Perhaps the Cube of Gaia is from my dimension.|
51571|What's it like in Navea?|
51572|What do you think about Navea?|
51573|#822$# It's a place where many different races live together. It's easily the biggest city in Terra.|
51574|#821$# The city isn't that big, but it's filled with creatures from all the races of Terra.
#823$# I admire the tolerance that the inhabitants of Terra show to each other.|
51575|#821$# Whatever I say would just be an outsider's perspective. Why not go and see for yourself?|
51576|#822$# It's a lively place filled with fascinating creatures. 
#821$# I can't remember ever seeing a more vital city.|
51581|What can you tell me about PvP?|
51582|Tell me about the Arena.|
51583|#821$# It's a place where humans fight each other and rank themselves.|
51584|#822$# The Arena made me see that humans are a contradictory race.
#821$# They all say they want peace, but they enjoy fighting as well.|
51585|#821$# It's a place where humans test their battle skills and fight each other.
#821$# You should go have a look. Hone your skills and practice with others - you might learn something!|
51586|#821$# Even with all the enemies around, humans are still fond of fighting each other.
#821$# For as long as I've been watching humans, I still don't understand them.|
51591|What's the point of joining a guild?|
51592|What are your thoughts on guilds?|
51593|#821$# Guilds are human organizational groups. They're a good way to meet people.
#821$# If you feel like being more social, you should join a guild.|
51594|#822$# Weak creatures always form groups to help each other get through life.|
51595|#821$# Human organizations... I barely pay attention to them.
#821$# I heard that Eidolons appear in Guild Manor, but only at certain times.
#822$# I'm very curious to learn more about this.|
51596|#821$# Instead of listening to me, why not join a guild and see for yourself?|
51601|Where are you from?|
51602|Tell me a bit about where you're from.|
51603|#821$# You've asked me this question before. Perhaps you've forgotten?
#822$# It was in a different dimension, where I had a different appearance.|
51604|#821$# If you're talking about the place I was born, it's a hard place for the weak to survive.
#821$# Only the powerful can survive in such a hostile environment, where you're always under attack.
#822$# My hometown seems a lot like Pandemonium in this dimension.|
51605|#821$# You might still not know that I am not from this dimension.
#824$# I traveled through many dimensions searching for you.|
51606|#821$# The most significant difference of my dimension is that it has five realms.
#821$# Heaven, Earth, Humans, Demons and Monsters... The creatures in different realms have agreed on mutual nonaggression.|
51611|Your weapon is awesome!|
51612|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
51613|#821$# This is my other half. It's called "Domesday".|
51614|#821$# The blade in my right hand can cut through space. I came to this dimension with its help.|
51615|#821$#The blade in my left hand can cut through time, and lets me travel to different eras.|
51616|#822$# Ha! You seem to like my other half.
#821$# But your human body can't handle the power, so you'd better not touch me!|
51621|Do you prefer human or dragon form?|
51622|What's your favorite form to take?|
51623|#821$# Dragons are too big to move around freely. If I need to move quickly, it's better to be in human form.|
51624|#822$# The dragon incarnation you've seen is not my true form.
#821$# My real dragon incarnation is immense - as big as Navea!|
51625|#822$# Dragon form is best when the situation calls for power.
#821$# This is the form I was in when I was born.|
51626|#821$# Whatever form I take, it's all me - like it or not!|
51631|What's the reason you came to Terra?|
51632|Why did you come to Terra?|
51633|#821$# I'm here to find someone. To fulfill a promise I made.|
51634|#821$# The person I'm seeking says, "immortality is pain."
#822$# Time exists only in Terra. That's why I'm here.|
51635|#822$# I once promised a child that we would go on adventures together.
#821$# We never went on our adventure - the child died while still young.
#821$# I need to find the child's reincarnation and fulfill my promise.|
51636|#822$# Dragons take promises very seriously, which is why it's rare for them to make promises.
#821$# I have made a promise to someone, and I'm here to fulfill it.|
51641|What do you know about the other Eidolons?|
51642|Can you dish up some great gossip about the Eidolons?|
51643|#821$# The first time I saw Kaiser Zeta, I thought he was just like the robots made by the Dwarves.
#821$# I was surprised to find that he thought and acted just like a human.
#822$# I wonder how Daedalus was able to make such a human-like robot.|
51644|#822$# Every time I see Serif, I think about you at that age.
#821$# When I first met you, you were the age Serif is now.|
51645|#821$# Even after all this time, Hel still has the innocence of a child.
#823$# Even I can't stop the erosion of time... It makes me admire her.|
51646|#822$# I feel a great kinship with Bealdor.
#821$# I used to be hot-blooded like him...|
51651|Is it doomsday already?|
51652|I've heard you only appear on doomsday... I hope that's not true!|
51653|#821$# Don't worry about it - it's just a rumor.|
51654|#822$# Ha! When I was younger, many considered me an incarnation of doomsday. But that's all in the past.
#821$# People are dazed and confused when they're young. I was no different.|
51655|#824$# What, you actually believe those rumors?|
51656|#822$# To some of my foes, I'm doomsday indeed.|
51661|I've heard that you're looking for someone.|
51662|Are you looking for someone?|
51663|#821$# Oh? Are you offering to help?
#822$# Thanks for your kindness, but I've already found the person I was looking for.|
51664|#821$# Your appearance may have changed, but the color of your soul hasn't.
#822$# You still look like you did when we first met. I'm very happy.|
51665|#821$# Yes, but I've already found that person. And that person is in front of me right now.|
51666|#821$# I came to Terra to find that person's reincarnation and fulfill my promise.|
51671|When you change form, where do your clothes go?|
51672|What happens to your clothes when you turn into a dragon?|
51673|#822$# Ha... Next time I change form, you must watch carefully.|
51674|#821$# I'm the pride of my clan. My form and appearance change together.
#821$# When I'm incarnated as a human, I wear clothes. When I appear as a dragon, I wear armor.|
51675|#822$# Ha... No matter how old you are, you always ask the same questions.
#821$# The first time I met you, you'd just turned 10, and you asked the same question.|
51676|#821$# Ha... Instead of asking me so many questions, why don't you find out for yourself? It's much more fun.|
51681|How old are you?|
51682|I hear you've been around for a long time...|
51683|#822$# Ha... In terms of human life, yes, I've lived for an extremely long time.|
51684|#821$# By the standards of my clan, I'm still young - barely an adult.
#821$# Our kind don't have many children, and I've never seen another clan like ours.|
51685|#822$# The life expectancy of my clan is very long compared to most creatures.
#821$# We sometimes wake from a dream to find that several hundred years have passed.|
51686|#821$# The life expectancy of my clan is extremely long compared to most creatures.
#822$# As a result, we try not to get involved with others.
#821$# Imagine waking up to find all your friends had died. It's a terrible feeling.|
51691|What would you do if we had to part ways?|
51692|What would you do if we separated?|
51693|#821$# Destiny may tear us apart, but it may also bring us together yet again.|
51694|#821$# Without you, I have no reason to be here.
#822$# I would leave this place and return to my home.|
51695|#821$# Don't worry too much about it - you'll find out soon.|
51696|#821$# Don't worry. I will always be with you, until the day you die.|
51801|Is there anyone that you have a crush on?|
51802|Is there someone that you care for?|
51803|#822$# I'm attracted to strong personalities who can meet me on an equal playing field.
#821$# But you're okay!|
51804|#824$# Hahaha! Is this a topic that interests you?
#824$# It's a shame I'm just a sword spirit. I can't really understand what it means to have a so-called 'crush' on someone...|
51805|#822$ You could say that I care for that fellow Alucard... He's a powerful character, after all...
#823$# What's more, he half-transformed himself into a weapon... almost like meeting me halfway!
#823$# I'd love to have a proper fight with him!|
51806|#821$# What kind of a question is that?
#821$# You, of course! Otherwise why would I have chosen to be with you?|
51811|What do you think of fighting?|
51812|Do you like to fight?|
51813|#824$# I love it, of course! That's not even a real question!|
51814|#823$# Hey! Of course! How about a real question?
#823$# Without regard for life or death, I'll put everything I've learned into defeating the enemy! 
#823$# I love the fact that, in the end, one side must always lose!|
51815|#821$# It seems that you're troubled by the idea of battle.
#821$# Here! Let's spar a little. Then you'll see how exciting battle really is.|
51816|#824$# What a silly question!
#822$# Don't forget: I'm a supernatural weapon - the divine sword Kusanagi!|
51821|I wish I could have a Kusanagi of my own!|
51822|Are you willing to rest at my side?|
51823|#823$# Hahaha! What, you?
#822$# When you grow strong enough, that day might arrive.|
51824|#822$# It's still too early! You're not strong enough yet.
#823$# But I'm happy to train with you for awhile.|
51825|#2$# Why don't we go a few rounds? If you beat me, I might just give it some thought.|
51826|#823$# Hahaha! Are you joking? Pretty funny!|
51831|Are you a good student?|
51832|Recommend a good book to me.|
51833|#824$# Hey! That doesn't interest me much... 
#821$# Reading really isn't my cup of tea, so don't ask me that kind of question.
#823$# After all, you don't look so clever yourself. Hahaha!|
51834|#824$# Books aren't my thing. But what if...
#821$# By way of recompense, I shall accompany you to the Otherworld to practice your skills.|
51835|#824$# What? No way! When Amaterasu teaches, I always want to fall asleep. 
#821$# I'm not the least bit interested in studying or reading.
#821$# But hey! That doesn't mean I'm stupid.|
51836|#824$#  What? Could you just stick to questions about weapons and battles?
#821$# You could, however, ask Amaterasu. She's always reading or studying something...|
51841|What should you do if you're feeling sad?|
51842|How do you improve your mood?|
51843|#822$# Perk up now, will you?|
51844|#821$# Haha. Laugh it off, or find someone to pick a fight with.|
51845|#821$# I find a tough fight and release all my pent-up woes in the heat of battle. 
#821$# That really perks me up! That's what I do anyway, even when I'm in a good mood.|
51846|#2$# Although... Amaterasu always used to comfort me when I was sad. 
#2$# You also have someone who you can really talk to, right?
#821$# You really don't? Then I'll be your first friend!|
51851|What do you know about the Quests?|
51852|Tell me about the Quests.|
51853|#821$# Helping others is what the strong ought to do!
#821$# You must try harder to complete missions and prove yourself!|
51854|#821$# I once heard Amaterasu say that in Terra there is an organisation called the Mirabelle Group.
#821$# They receive requests from people in trouble, from all around. You'll help them, won't you?|
51855|#821$# You've had a long day! Completing all those quests!
#821$# If you keep on like this, you'll be better compensated than you may think!|
51856|#824$# The humans are weak... They're often unable to resolve problems on their own.
#824$# So they've put together an organisation that appoints a capable person to deal with matters.
#824$# Maybe you'll consider helping out?|
51861|What's the Cube of Gaia?|
51862|Do you know what the Cube of Gaia is?|
51863|#823$# You really don't know?|
51864|#821$# It's the immense power that created the heavens and the earth, established the three realms, and nutured all life.
#823$# Hahaha! Probably, anyway! That's what Amaterasu told me.
#821$# But I've been thinking... how does such a huge power not have conciousness?|
51865|#824$# That's to say... such a mighty cube...
#821$# Might one day magically transform into a human!|
51866|#824$# I don't understand it so well myself. But I seem to remember Amaterasu talking about it.|
51871|Can you tell me about Blizzard Berg?|
51872|Have you been to Blizzard Berg?|
51873|#824$# Hasn't that place been ravaged by war?|
51874|#821$# There's not much to tell. Why don't you just go and see for yourself!
#822$# Fires and blood. The name brings up some bad memories...|
51875|#823$# It's a freezing place. Haha!|
51876|#821$# I prefer hot to cold, so maybe you should to go Blizzard Berg on your own!|
51881|Can you fish?|
51882|Dou you know how to fish?|
51883|#823$# Hahaha! You really ask some strange questions!
#821$# Why not go and try instead of asking?|
51884|#822$# Water makes me ill! I hope we don't have to get too close to water... 
#821$# But Amaterasu did say that in Terra there are many experts in this field. Why not go and ask?|
51885|#824$# Hey... Are you just talking to hear your own voice? 
#821$# Isn't fishing just a matter of dangling the rod over the water and waiting? No?|
51886|#821$# I'll put it like this... Amaterasu did say that many precious things have been hidden in the waters of Terra.
#824$# But I'm not interested. Why don't you go and try?|
51891|Can you tell me something interesting?|
51892|Tell me about the Hidden Quests.|
51893|#824$# Hey! Don't wait for me to tell you... Go and explore for yourself!|
51894|#821$# I've heard Amaterasu say that small quests are hidden in every region.
#821$# Let me think... I've heard they are marked by green exclamation marks on the map.|
51895|#821$# Hmm... Amaterasu told me. Let me think...
#824$# Sorry. I completely forgot...|
51896|#823$# Hahaha! Just be aware of your surroundings.|
51901|How is Amaterasu related to you?|
51902|Who is Amaterasu?|
51903|#823$# Haha. Are you curious?
#821$# Amaterasu is the bearer of my original sword, and is also the only one who can defeat me!
#821$# But if I keep on training with you... One day I'll certainly be able to beat her.|
51904|#824$# Although I don't care to admit it, Amaterasu is my master. 
#822$# She's also the only one who can defeat me!|
51905|#824$# What a mood killer... Do we have to talk about her?|
51906|#822$# She's my bearer, and my teacher...
#821$# She taught me everything that I know about Terra, including you and your sacred mission.|
51911|From what were you created?|
51912|How was your body forged?|
51913|#821$# I was created through magic, from the body of a snake. Its blood enabled me to magically transform into a spirit sword. 
#823$# To use a human phrase... My last job was as a Demon Sword. Hahaha!|
51914|#822$# As for where I came from... well, the fires in Terra aren't hot enough to forge a weapon like me!|
51915|#824$# Are all humans so nosy? 
#821$# I might as well tell you... the truth is...
#821$# The bones of a demon formed my body. A demon's blood forged my spirit.|
51916|#824$# It's a long story... Let's not go into it.|
51921|Are you really strong?|
51922|Can anyone defeat you?|
51923|#823$# Hahaha! I'm the divine sword Kusanagi!
#822$# I've never met anyone able to withstand my attacks!
#824$# Apart from Amaterasu... but strictly speaking, she's a god.|
51924|#822$# Are you asking because you want to fight?
#822$# Great! I've been hoping to spar from the first moment I set eyes on you! 
#821$# Eh? Where are you going? Don't run off!|
51925|#822$# Humans are always asking questions!
#824$# How many Eidolons have you asked the same thing?|
51926|#823$# I've never been beaten by anyone but Amaterasu!
#823$# So you should have an idea of how strong I am!
#821$# Warped self-confidence is a fine recipe for defeat - so we must always strive to improve ourselves. Right?|
51931|That armor looks really nice on you.|
51932|Tell me about your equipment!|
51933|#821$# This part was transformed from a scabbard!
#824$# If you took away the scabbard, I would be completely naked...
#823$# Haha, only joking! Wait... Does that excite you?|
51934|#2$# It looks good! Haha. You really know how to give a compliment!|
51935|#821$# While we're on the topic, people have asked about my relationship to Kaiser Zeta. 
#824$# My equipment materialized when I transformed into a spirit sword. 
#821$# The origin of my costume? Honestly, this all stems from Amaterasu's sartorial taste...|
51936|#823$# I'm the divine sword Kusanagi! Of course I need a handsome set of armor!
#822$# What? Kaiser Zeta reminds you of me? He's just a copycat!|
51941|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
51942|Tell me some interesting tidbits about the other Eidolons.|
51943|#822$# Abraxas is always going around boasting that he's an undefeated warrior.
#822$# But he's never willing to accept my challenge to fight, saying he doesn't fight with women...
#2$# I guess he's scared of my laser cannons. Haha!|
51944|#2$# That said, Bealdor has a certain presence. 
#2$# His beaming radiance is similar to that of Amaterasu...
#824$# No,no, what am I saying... Bealdor is nothing but a child in comparison with Amaterasu!|
51945|#824$# That girl Tsubaki isn't the sharpest tool in the box...
#824$# Recently, I saw her practicing a sleazy dance routine with Bel-Chandra. She really seems to worry about how big she is...
#821$# I think that what is natural is beautiful. Don't you think so?|
51946|#821$# Listen up: Kotonoha used to be a fox with nine tails!
#821$# Eh? You didn't know? I see...
#824$# Now you tell me something. Nothing else comes to mind...|
51951|What kind of training exercises do you usually do?|
51952|How do you train yourself?|
51953|#821$# When I practiced with Amaterasu, I learned to meditate...
#2$# You may not believe it, but through meditation I've learned a lot about my own shortcomings. 
#821$# Actually, while you're resting, I meditate and reflect on our experiences together...|
51954|#822$# I fight relentlessly! Fight after fight!
#822$# The principle is simple. If you neglect your practice, you will be easily beaten by your opponents.|
51955|#822$# Perhaps the fact that you're asking means your skills aren't up to scratch...
#821$# Every strong warrior must find his or her own way to train. You, too, must find a path of your own.|
51956|#823$# Hahaha! I once asked Amaterasu the same question. 
#824$# She wanted me to ease off, because I was always rushing off to fight...
#824$# Spend more time admiring the scenery!|
51961|Why did you come to Terra?|
51962|Do you have a specific purpose here?|
51963|#821$# To aid you in fulfilling your destiny!
#2$# As to what that destiny is...
#823$# The plans of the gods cannot be known! Isn't that what you humans say?|
51964|#824$# Haven't you noticed all the strange things happening on Terra?
#821$# That's right. You are human, after all!|
51965|#822$# I'm carrying out the orders of Amaterasu: to find a capable person, worthy of trust. 
#821$# That's right. It's you! I know you won't let me down.|
51966|#823$# Haha. Do you need a reason for everything?|
51971|You're very pretty!|
51972|You've really kept in shape!|
51973|#2$# Huh? Really? I didn't know you had such good taste.
#2$# Usually I ask Amaterasu to help me with the polishing, and then I use a soft cloth to give myself a good shine. From time to time, she'll use oil as well. 
#2$# What? Ridiculous! That can't be what you mean!|
51974|#823$# Hahaha! Flattery will get you nowhere!|
51975|#2$# Huh? To be honest, Amaterasu wanted me this way. 
#2$# Sometimes I wish I could wear feathers like Vermilion - but after all, I am a spirit sword...
#823$# This look suits me the best! Don't you agree?|
51976|#822$# Eh? What's with all the sweet talk?
#823$# Are you up to something...?|
51981|What's with the Great Serpent?|
51982|Tell me about the eight-headed serpent.|
51983|#821$# I was created from the body of the eight-headed serpent, so I suppose you could say the serpent is my mother.|
51984|#821$# The serpent's blood still runs through my veins.
#824$# If it weren't for Amaterasu, I'd still be a Demon Sword, slaughtering innocent people...|
51985|#821$# The eight-headed, eight-tailed Monster symbolizes destruction. 
#824$# But she's also my mother...
#824$# Maybe, one day, I'll be unable to control the demon blood running through my veins.|
51986|#821$# A general, defeated at the hands of Amaterasu! 
#822$# He's an opponent I've always wanted to challenge.|
51991|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
51992|What's your plan after we part ways?|
51993|#824$# No way! Do you really think you could die so easily?
#821$# I'll protect you! Don't worry, okay?|
51994|#821$# I'd never thought of that, let alone planned for it...
#823$# Hahaha! After all, only the weak make plans for the future!|
51995|#822$# If you keep asking that kind of question, I'm going to thump someone on the head!|
51996|#824$# Perhaps I'll head back to Amaterasu and see what arrangements have been made...|
52101|Do you like to travel?|
52102|Let's go on a journey!|
52103|#821$#Want to go traveling with Gretel?
#51$#No way! Besides, Gretel won't want to.|
52104|#823$#Hansel is my best friend. We live together in the forest.
#822$#If Master wants to travel somewhere, I'd most like to go to Rainmist Reach!|
52105|#825$#If you don't want to take my brother along... then I'm not going anywhere!
#824$#Me either! If Gretel's not going, then neither am I!|
52106|#822$#I've been to more places with Gretel than I have with you.
#825$#But every time we get lost, my brother always says...
#824$#There's... there's no need to mention that!|
52111|What's your most memorable experience?|
52112|An unforgettable memory?|
52113|#822$# It's enough to flush my cheeks and raise my pulse!
#823$# Hehe. Gretel's talking about the first time she met you, master!|
52114|#826$#That time we fought the witch in the forest... I'll never forget it!
#826$#Ah! The time when Hansel got tossed sky-high?
#824$#Hold up... "sky-high"?! Master, don't listen to her!|
52115|#822$#I'll give it some thought! It's probably the day that we met you, our master.
#821$#I think so too... I'll never forget how surprised and happy you were.
#823$#I'm so happy we can travel with you!
#826$#We're counting on you, Master!|
52116|#824$#Hmm...there was one time when we were lost deep in the woods...
#821$#Gretel had left some stones behind to mark our way.
#826$#Her prudence saved our life.
#827$#Hehe. I'm pretty clever, aren't I!?|
52121|What do you like to eat?|
52122|What kind of food do you like most?|
52123|#822$#My brother says I eat too much candy, but I can't say no to sweets!
#823$#Master, if you want some, I'd be happy to share with you...|
52124|#826$#I like to eat apples - nice and healthy! Huh? Candy?
#824$#Who doesn't love candy...but you have to be careful not to overdo it!|
52125|#822$#I'm not picky. I'll eat anything!
#823$#Apart from vegetables, of course.|
52126|#2$#Speaking of food, I'm hungry. Hansel, have an apple!
#823$#Sorry, Master; we only have two. Maybe next time...|
52131|What's your favorite season?|
52132|Which season do you find most comfortable?|
52133|#821$#I prefer autumn. Weather that's cool, but not too cold suits me the best.
#822$#My favorite season is summer! Spring isn't bad either...autumn...
#823$#well! I'll just say autumn like my brother then...|
52134|#825$#Gretel doesn't like winter...|
52135|#821$#Each day's weather is unique, don't you think?|
52136|#823$#I don't like winter. It's so cold that you can't go out to play.
#821$#She's on pretty good terms with Shirayuki, though. Shirayuki really comes alive during the winter.|
52141|Which animals do you like most?|
52142|Do you have a favorite animal?|
52143|#822$#I like sheep the most. They're so cute and well behaved!
#823$#Wild wolves are pretty cool, too.|
52144|#826$#My favorite animal is the wild wolf! They're awesome!
#821$#Gretel likes sheep, and so do I, of course.|
52145|#822$#I like all kinds of animals...
#823$#Insects, however, are another story entirely.
#825$#Yup...can't stand bugs!|
52146|#823$#Why do you ask? Should I be expecting something?
#822$#I want a little kitten doll! One that looks like Astraea!|
52151|Tell me something about Rainmist Reach.|
52152|What's special about Rainmist Reach?|
52153|#821$#It's a forest of delicious mushrooms. Man, my stomach is growling already...
#2$#Hansel, let's have an apple!|
52154|#822$#A forest of mushrooms is a bit different from other forests!
#821$#But I've heard that there are spores that can make you sick...
#826$#As long as you stick with us, you'll be fine!|
52155|#822$#If you're going, I'd like to come with you to pick some mushrooms!
#824$#No, Gretel; Rainmist Reach has been polluted...
#825$#Then we should go and help the locals! And pick some mushrooms when we're done!|
52156|#821$#I've heard there's a monster there called the Snapping Sandworm that ambushes people from underground...
#826$#You've really got to be careful! I'd be scared of being attacked from behind!|
52161|Have you been to Navea?|
52162|Heard of Navea?|
52163|#822$#Sure! Hansel and I have both been there. That place is crammed with people!
#821$#A lot of adventurers hang out at the market stalls. If you're interested, you can go and take a look.
#826$#If you're going, you should take us with you!|
52164|#821$#I don't know if you've noticed, but the scenery outside Navea is really beautiful!
#823$#Gretel and I often picnic by the waterfall there.
#826$#Will you come with us next time?|
52165|#822$#Of course I've heard of it. The Sky Tower is in Navea!
#823$#But you knew that, didn't you, Master?|
52166|#822$#On top of being bustling and beautiful, the food and drink in Navea is great!
#823$#The frosted macaroons are delicious!
#821$#I always go straight for the food.|
52171|Can you tell me a little about the Temple of the Eidolons?|
52172|The Temple of the Eidolons?|
52173|#825$#I'm not so clear on that...why don't you tell me when you've found out?|
52174|#821$#I've heard it was built by the organization that conducts research on Eidolons.
#824$#Though I'm a little fuzzy on the details...|
52175|#821$#I think it's some kind of mysterious laboratory. You can summon and face off against part of an Eidolon's will...
#826$#That sounds exciting. I'm up for it! Master, will you lead us to this challenge?|
52176|#821$#I'm not so sure how it works, but I've heard that it can challenge the powerful Eidolons...
#826$#Maybe this would be a good oportunity to win the favor of other Eidolons.|
52181|What's the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
52182|What can you tell me about the Aura Kingdom Quiz?|
52183|#822$#I know! That's it! It's...
#825$#now I've lost it. Sorry, Master. I'm going back to study!|
52184| |
52185|#822$#That's a good question! Do you know, Hansel?
#826$#Of course I know. I've studied up on all this with Bealdor!
#822$#Master, you're the only one who doesn't know.|
52186|#822$#Quiz? Why don't you give it a practice run with me?
#823$#Bro! Who's the cutest girl alive?
#827$#Gretel is the cutest girl alive, of course.|
52191|Can you tell me a bit about the Auction House?|
52192|What's the Auction House for?|
52193|#822$#A place where you can buy a load of candy? Master, you'll buy me some, won't you?|
52194| |
52195|#823$#I want to open a candy shop at the Auction House!
#821$#You'll put up the capital, won't you, Master?|
52196|#826$#Master, you'll be able to find anything at the Auction House !
#821$#That's what's so special about it.|
52201|I've heard you have a way with witches!|
52202|Have you ever defeated a witch?|
52203|#826$#Bring it on, bi- err, witches!|
52204|#825$#They're not your average witches - they're evil! They worship an evil force...
#827$#Gretel, don't be afraid. Master and I will both protect you!|
52205|#821$#It was a really close shave. That witch was planning to scarf us down for din-din...
#822$#Bro's so stacked that the witch didn't know what hit her!
#823$#The witch had no chance against sis's magic!|
52206|#825$#I can't remember; if you really want to know, ask my brother.|
52211|Wow! A Shining Stone!|
52212|I've picked up a Shining Stone!|
52213|#822$#Wow! A Shining Stone. I want it!
#821$#Hel used to have Shining Stones like this.
#823$#I wonder if she picked them up because she was afraid she'd get lost...|
52214|#821$#Wow! These stones are particularly useful as path markers. With their help, you'll be able to find a way out of the forest.
#822$#Is picking up stones...a hobby of yours? Hmm...that's a pretty unique hobby.|
52215|Wow! A Shining Stone!?|
52216|#821$#Hehe. Master, do you like these little things?
#827$#I like bright little stones too!|
52221|Can you tell me something about your weapon?|
52222|What is your weapon?|
52223|#826$#My gloves are called Moonhowl Claws! Pretty cool, huh?
#821$#With a swipe and a slash, I can whip up a tornado and blow the enemy halfway to Oz!
#826$#I can tell you're impressed.|
52224|#822$#I have the windshear horn, Kotonoha and Aelius.
#2$#I also have an all-purpose picnic basket! It's full of apples, lollipops, doughnuts...|
52225|#826$#The wind is our weapon!
#823$#You're such a stallion!|
52226|#822$#Mine isn't just any picnic basket!
#823$#Even if used as a weapon in battle, it won't break! It's a super picnic basket!|
52231|Would you ever consider spending some time apart?|
52232|Have you tried separating?|
52233|#825$#Master, how could you ask that? Now I'm angry!|
52234|#51$#Master, what are you playing at? Gretel, get behind me!|
52235|#822$#I've never even considered it...my brother can't live without me!
#824$#Don't you mean the opposite?|
52236|#822$#We've always been together. We've never thought of separating...
#825$#Master, are you asking because you've been through a painful breakup...?
#821$#Master, don't be sad. Gretel and I will always be there for you!|
52241|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
52242|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolons.|
52243|#822$#I'll let you in on a secret: Grandpa Vayu and Vermilion are a couple!
#824$#Gretel, don't spout rubbish; Master will fall for it...
#823$#Hehe. I was just joking...|
52244|#821$#Huh...Bealdor and Hel weren't getting on...
#823$#Astraea had to intervene.
#824$#Hey! Enough joking around, Master will believe it!!!|
52245|#822$#Shirayuki comes from a very far-off place. I've heard that it's always winter there...
#825$#I hate winter. But I like Shirayuki.
#821$#She's so kind to me, and always gives me candy.
#823$#That's right! Shirayuki is the best!|
52246|#821$#I've heard that Astraea is Aelius and Serena's sister.
#824$#But they don't look that alike...|
52251|Have you heard of Candy Cottage?|
52252|Are you from Candy Cottage?|
52253|#821$#Master, where did you hear about that?|
52254|#822$#Candy is my favorite! So, someone has written about Candy Cottage!
#821$#If you're interested, Master, you can come and take a look!|
52255|#821$#That's what it's called, but not everything there is candy...
#822$#As much as I'd like it to be.|
52256|#822$#A cottage made of candy...sounds tasty!
#821$#But you must be talking about our home.
#822$#Eh? Our home is called Candy Cottage, but it's not made of candy.|
52261|Could you tell me a little about those two puppets?|
52262|What puppet is that?|
52263|#822$#This is Kotonoha and Aelius.
#822$#Master, you may not believe it, but these two puppets were made by my brother!|
52264|#821$#Those are Gretel's, but they're not just simple puppets!
#826$#They can store huge amounts of magic and release a ton of power!|
52265|#823$#I made them for Gretel when she was small and had trouble sleeping.|
52266|#823$#Hehe - they're cute, aren't they? But I can't give them to you; they're Gretel's.|
52271|What do you do to wind down?|
52272|What do you normally get up to?|
52273|#823$#I like to go on picnics with Gretel. Master, maybe next time you'll come along!|
52274|#826$#I usually see Kaiser Zeta about learning new fighting skills! But...
#824$#I still haven't figured out how to shoot out beams of destruction...|
52275|#824$#I usually take Gretel shopping...Girls really know how to spend these days.
#821$#Master, why don't you come with me next time?|
52276|#822$#Hmm, nothing all that special. Why don't you come hang out with us, Master?
#826$#Yeah, come along - it'll be fun!|
52281|Both of you are really cute!|
52282|You're cute.|
52283|#823$#Thank you, Master! You've made Gretel happy, and you're cute too!|
52284|#821$#Hmm! Don't you think I look more impressive while fighting?
#822$#I'm not that keen on being called "cute".
#824$#But if it's you who's saying it, Master, then I don't mind...|
52285|#822$#Master, do you think Gretel's puppets are cute?|
52286|#824$#Thanks...
#825$#Hansel is embarrassed because you said he was cute.
#821$#That's not it! I'd just prefer that you think of me as handsome and cool...|
52291|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
52292|What's your plan after we part ways?|
52293|#825$#I don't want to...Wherever Master goes, I want to go with him.|
52294|#824$#Eh? Master, are you going somewhere where we can't follow?|
52295|#825$#I...I'd never thought that...
#827$#Let's head into the woods and wait for Master to return!|
52296|#825$#I don't want to part with you, Master! I don't want to leave Hansel either...
#827$#I won't leave Gretel! Master, where are you planning to go?|
52401|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
52402|How do you kill time?|
52403|#822$#Sometimes I practice with Sigrun to stay in tip-top fighting shape.
#821$#I gotta stay sharp - protecting you is a full time job.
#822$#Also, you've been getting stronger too - there's no way I'm gonna let you show me up!|
52404|#821$#A good rest helps optimize your training.
#822$#I can teach you how to train, if you're interested!|
52405|#822$#I also knit and cook from time to time, speaking of which...
#823$#How about a scarf! Blizzard Berg is too cold, I'm worried you might catch a nasty bug.|
52406|#821$#You're a hot topic with the other Eidolons during breaks.
#822$#Everyone speaks so highly of you! I am so proud of you!|
52411|What are your weaknesses?|
52412|Are you scared of anything?|
52413|#822$#With you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything.|
52414|#821$#Let me guess why you asked...|
52415|#821$#I'm fearless and rather powerful, in case you hadn't noticed.
#824$#C'mon! Do I really have to point it out?|
52416|#824$#Do you always have to be so blunt? If you were having a pleasant conversation with a powerful enemy, would you ask the same question?
#821$#Since we're on the topic, I'm gonna lay down a couple ground rules:  Don't talk to strangers, and whatever you do DON'T take their candy!|
52421|What to do if you encounter a strong enemy?|
52422|How do you handle a strong enemy?|
52423|#823$#Fear not. We'll charge the enemy head-on!
#821$#Don't worry, I'll have your back!|
52424|#821$#Cute question, don't you have the Goddess of War by your side already?|
52425|#823$#I'll be rooting for you...safe where no one can see me!
#822$#Just kidding, I'll fight right along with you and Duchess Victory.|
52426|#822$#First block their blow with your shield, then swoop in when their guard is down...
#821$#Huh? You don't want me getting physical with the enemy?
#824$#Stop it!... You're making me blush!|
52431|What do you like to eat?|
52432|What do you like to eat?|
52433|#821$#I've always wanted to try a golden apple, and once I was THIS close to tasting one...|
52434|#821$#Nothing in particular...
#822$#Why don't you tell me about your favorite food? I'm a magician in the kitchen!|
52435|#821$#Don't bother, Eidolons like me create our own energy from the sun and the moon.
#822$#Haha, gotcha! Seriously, I'd love to try anything you make!|
52436|#824$#Are you hungry already?! But we aren't even finished training yet!
#821$#Alright, but just this once! Take a break.|
52441|Who do you like?|
52442|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
52443|#822$#Good question! I like a strong personality,
#821$#someone who's powerful, compassionate, and trusted by the Eidolons.
#823$#Ah, have I said too much?|
52444|#821$#Hmm... I'm worried about Alucard's unusually strong power,
#821$#I may need every ounce of strength to fight him...
#822$#Who do you think will win?|
52445|#822$#Don't you have a better question?
#821$#Besides, you already know the answer to this question.|
52446|#821$#I wonder how Abraxas is doing...
#824$#As well as Serena and Aelius...
#822$#But most of all, I wonder why you're asking me this question?|
52451|Have you heard of the Glorious Frost Crown?|
52452|Tell me about the Glorious Frost Crown.|
52453|#822$#Are you interested in the war? Although I'd like to explain everything to you...
#821$#it would be better if you could experience it yourself.|
52454|#821$#The war has been dragging on for centuries now.
#822$#The Azure Frost Tribe fought against the Scarlet Flame Tribe in a quest for glory.
#823$#You've got to give them credit, at least they're fighting for what they believe in. Don't you agree?|
52455|#821$#I think this war would be over a lot sooner if I were the commander.|
52456|#822$#Are you really interested, or do you just want to talk?
#821$#I am happy with either!|
52461|What's Emerald Marsh like?|
52462|Tell me about Emerald Marsh.|
52463|#822$#Emerald Marsh lies in the north of Midgard.
#821$#I heard that it's under lockdown at the moment. So be careful if you're heading there.|
52464|#821$#I hear Waterweed Wetland in Emerald Marsh is quite beautiful.
#823$#Maybe we should see for ourselves if the legends of its splendor are true...|
52465|#821$#There's an evil corrupting Emerald Marsh...
#824$#If it falls into the wrong hands, it could be disastrous.|
52466|#822$#What? You're not dilly-dallying, are you? That's not allowed!
#824$#Emerald Marsh is a dangerous place right now. Just think about all those savage beasts and demons...
#821$#But if you insist on going, at least take me with you - my shield can keep you safe.|
52471|Can you tell me about the Sky Tower?|
52472|What's the Sky Tower like?|
52473|#822$#Rumor has it there's a mystical potion at the very top of the Sky Tower that can cure any illness.
#824$#Though as an Eidolon, I don't understand what it feels like to be sick...|
52474|#822$#Supposedly the Sky Tower was sealed a long time ago.
#821$#It beats me why it's suddenly open again...|
52475|#822$#There seem to be rare treasures sealed in the tower...
#823$#Should we check it out?|
52476|#821$#I wonder if I'll be able to see my hometown from the top of the Sky Tower...|
52481|I'd like to know more about Dragon Points.|
52482|What can you tell me about Dragon Points?|
52483|#822$#You receive Dragon Points for defeating powerful enemies.
#821$#You can exchange them for fantastic prizes.
#823$#Let's go collect some Dragon Points!|
52484|#822$#Dragon Points are blessed by Azuria.
#821$#If you're collecting them, I'll lend you a hand!|
52485|#821$#I'm curious too. I wonder what kind of item it is? It'd have to be pretty special to be exchanged for such rare treasures.|
52486|#823$#Are you going to give me the Accessory you've exchanged?|
52491|Tell me more about Archaeology.|
52492|Let's talk about Archaeology!|
52493|#822$#This isn't too difficult, why don't you try to solve it yourself?!
#821$#You can't be TOO dependent on me.|
52494|#821$#You're as curious as I am! Let's see...
#822$#If I remember right, you can practice Archaeology if you buy the right tools from an Archaeologist Merchant.
#821$#I bet you'll dig up some priceless artifacts!|
52495|#821$#This question is way above my pay grade.
#822$#I suggest you ask the Archaeology Association.
#823$#They'll give you a much better explanation!|
52496|#822$#I hear there are a few treasure maps lying around.
#821$#I'm dying to know what's underground!
#823$#Let's do a bit of digging if we have some spare time! |
52501|Would you like to introduce your weapon?|
52502|Let's talk about your weapon.|
52503|#821$#Her name is Duchess Victory - my steadfast companion through countless battles.
#822$#She can deflect any attack with her left hand and defeat any defense with her right.|
52504|#821$#The spear in her right hand can overcome any defense, and the golden shield in her left can block any attack!
#824$#I can tell from the look in your eyes that you want them to fight each other.|
52505|#821$#A worthy companion, just like you.|
52506|#824$#It's so embarrassing that you found out...
#821$#I wrote my name on the shield in case I'd lose it... It's not an autograph...
#822$#Eh? How could you have lost that? Don't worry about such trivial matters!|
52511|Why did you come to Terra?|
52512|What brought you to Terra?|
52513|#821$#You probably know better than I do.|
52514|#822$#I have to serve as his guardian angel and protect him on his quest.
#821$#Care to guess who I'm talking about?|
52515|#822$#I came here to find the person I need to protect.|
52516|#2$#Sightseeing! Terra is completely different from my homeland.
#821$#Okay, I was only joking. I really would like you to show me around if time permits.|
52521|Serena is cute!|
52522|Serena reminds me of a cute little rabbit.|
52523|#821$#Cute? I'm not sure we're talking about the same Serena.|
52524|#821$#I do have a sister named Serena.
#822$#However, I'm not sure she's the one you were referring to.
#824$#The Serena I know is more... more...|
52525|#823$#I guess she is pretty cute. If only she and Aelius could patch things up... |
52526|#51$#Come again? Serena?|
52531|Your outfit is astonishing!|
52532|You look beautiful!|
52533|#821$#Such flattery! What's your angle?
#823$#Well, you look pretty sharp, too!|
52534|#821$#I crafted this armor myself. It looks like we both have the same sense of style!|
52535|#822$#Armor should to be ornate and lightweight, as well as defensive.
#823$#The armor I'm currently wearing is my magnum opus!|
52536|#823$#You do like it, don't you?
#824$#I don't know what I'd do if you didn't.|
52541|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
52542|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolons.|
52543|#822$#Don't you think Kusanagi and Kaiser Zeta are alike?
#821$#Kaiser Zeta always tries change the subject when asked about Kusanagi, though...|
52544|#822$#Merrilee seems to like apples, too. To her, apples symbolize wisdom.
#821$#I wonder if she knows about the golden apple...|
52545|#822$#Vayu and Vermilion come from a place which is completely different from my hometown.
#821$#This means that the world created by the Cube of Gaia is much larger than I had imagined.
#824$#It seems that I still have much to learn.|
52546|#822$#Aelius hides a handsome face behind that cape.
#821$#Personally, I think he's as handsome as Bealdor!|
52551|Do you have many siblings?|
52552|Can you tell me about your siblings?|
52553|#822$#You know Aelius and Serena, don't you?
#821$#They're my beloved brother and sister; they symbolize the sun and the moon, respectively.|
52554|#824$#Thanks to my father... I do have quite a few siblings.|
52555|#824$#Aelius and Serena haven't seen each other since that incident.
#822$#I wish they would just make up with one another. What do you think?
#821$#Please talk to them about it if you have the time.|
52556|#822$#Why bring this up all of a sudden? Do you have problems with your siblings?
#821$#So do I...|
52561|I hear you're very good at crafty things.|
52562|Are you any good at knitting?|
52563|#822$#Have you been asking about me? I am, indeed! I can knit just about anything.
#821$#Next time you want to know something about me, just ask me directly.|
52564|#823$#I'm not only good at knitting; I can also cook!
#822$#You should try sometime! My specialty is Stardust Flower sauteed in dirt.|
52565|#822$#Tanith often praises me like that, too.
#824$#It's usually because she wants my help, though.
#823$#Just let me know if there's anything I can do to help!|
52566|#823$#Next time, you can see for yourself just how good I am.|
52571|Is there anything that makes you angry?|
52572|What is something that would make you angry?|
52573|#824$#It's dangerous to be a slave to your emotions.
#821$#What? Suppose someone lifts up my skirt?
#823$#Of course I'd be angry! Very!|
52574|#822$#I don't think I'd be able to keep my cool 
#821$#if someone tried to hurt you in front of me.|
52575|#821$#Sometimes I just get up on the wrong side of the bed...
#824$#Hush! Don't tell anyone! I'm embarrassed about it.|
52576|#821$#Take a deep breath and calm down so you can think.|
52581|Let's talk about the time of your birth.|
52582|Do you remember your birth?|
52583|#821$#Mother said I was born wearing armor, weapon in hand.
#822$#Do you think I was supposed to be a boy?  |
52584|#821$#That was such a long time ago...
#824$#Are you trying to get me to reveal my age? Shoot!|
52585|#824$#I've heard that Father was scared of my birth.
#821$#He tried to stop me from being born.|
52586|#821$#My first words were, "I am the Almighty."
#823$#Haha - I'm just pulling your leg.|
52591|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
52592|What's your plan after we part ways?|
52593|#824$#When that day comes, you must be strong enough to go on without my protection.|
52594|#822$#Why are you bringing this up now?
#823$#Don't worry about it. I've never even thought about leaving your side!  |
52595|#821$#Even if we take divergent paths, we will meet again - it is our destiny.|
52596|#821$#I will return whence I came and watch over you from afar.|
52701|Feel like singing?|
52702|Sing a song for me!|
52703|#822$#Nah, I'll pass.|
52704|#823$#I don't really feel like singing, why don't you go first?|
52705|#821$#Right here right now? No way Jose!
#824$#No stage, no band... No way I'm singing under these circumstances!|
52706|#823$#What? You're a fan of my band too?!|
52711|What do you do in your free time?|
52712|How do you like to kick back and relax?|
52713|#822$#I'm so not telling you! A girl's gotta have some secrets!|
52714|#822$#Uh, I dunno. Read a book maybe? It's not like you're that special to me. Don't flatter yourself.
#821$#What did you think?|
52715|#822$#Work on my plans to steal your heart! You'll be mine one day, you can count on that!|
52716|#823$#You go first! If I like what I hear, maybe I'll share too!|
52721|What's your most memorable experience?|
52722|Anything ever happen that was simply unforgettable?|
52723|#821$#The first time I met Serena... I was so startled, I couldn't believe my eyes...|
52724|#823$#The day I met you! I don't think I'll ever forget that look on your face!
#821$#Just admit it, you got the hots for me, dontcha?!|
52725|#821$#A few years back, I had this delicious chocolate mousse that was simply divine... I'd die to taste it again!|
52726|#823$#Now you mention it... I had a dream about you last night...|
52731|Do you like to fight?|
52732|What do you think of fighting?|
52733|#821$#Fighting makes my clothes dirty so I like to avoid it...
#824$#Gotta keep up appearances!|
52734|#822$#If someone picked a fight with you, they'd live to regret it!|
52735|#823$#What about you? You like to fight, right? I'll let you do all the hard work then!|
52736|#821$#I don't really like to, but if you asked me nicely, I suppose I could do you a favor...|
52741|Do you prefer day or night?|
52742|Which do you prefer, day or night?|
52743|#821$#It's a no-brainer... Night of course! I didn't get my nickname "Mistress of Moonshadow" for nothing!|
52744|#824$#Are you... seriously asking me this question?|
52745|#822$#That being said, I don't mind daytime. After all, the sunlight lets you enjoy my pretty face even more!|
52746|#821$#Which do you prefer? I happen to like both!|
52751|What's special about Port Skandia?|
52752|Can you give me an introduction to Port Skandia?|
52753|#822$#Isn't that your hometown? You ought to know that place better than I do!|
52754|#821$#I hear it's got lots of fish... And boats?|
52755|#824$#Just your average seaside town I suppose...|
52756|#821$#I don't have the slightest idea... Aren't you the expert on that?|
52761|Could you tell me something about Starstruck Plateau?|
52762|Have you been to Starstruck Plateau?|
52763|#821$#You can see my home from there!|
52764|#821$#The place with fallen stars?... That place always gives me the creeps. Be careful if you have to go there.
#824$#I'd be heartbroken if anything happened to you!|
52765|#821$#You planning to go there? I'm coming along! You better not forget me!
#822$#Taking a long, moonlit walk with you under an ocean of stars... I can't think of anything more romantic!|
52766|#824$#That place... it's contaminated by a dark force.
#821$#Not that I hate the darkness, but I'd be extra careful there if I were you.|
52771|Could you tell me your opinion on Terra?|
52772|What do you think of Terra?|
52773|#821$#Terra is where you live.|
52774|#822$#Terra is a bustling place, nothing like where I come from.|
52775|#821$#What is your opinion on the Eidolon Menu then?|
52776|#823$#I love Terra! It's the place that created YOU!|
52781|Can you tell me about Refining Levels?|
52782|What do you know about Refining?|
52783|#821$#I'm allergic to manual labor. I'll just leave it up to you!|
52784|#821$#Refining Levels... you do the same thing over and over again, getting a little better each time.|
52785|#821$#If you're planning to go digging in the dirt sometime soon... I think I'll just leave alone for a while.|
52786|#821$#I have no idea! Why don't you ask someone else?|
52791|Could you tell me about the Glorious Frost Crown?|
52792|Have you heard of the Glorious Frost Crown?|
52793|#821$#It's all about fighting and killing each other. That's just so barbaric!|
52794|#821$#The view there is quite nice though... if only we could get rid of all the fighting.|
52795|#821$#Two words¡Vsky high! You feel like you can reach out and touch the stars!|
52796|#821$#If you plan on going there... be careful...|
52801|What's the relationship between you and Serena?|
52802|What's the relationship between you and the Moonlight Maiden?|
52803|#821$#You tell me!|
52804|#821$#Serena? Doesn't ring a bell.
#824$#Hey! Don't you peek at my Picture Book!|
52805|#821$#We're sort of... twins? I don't really know though. But we are definitely NOT the same! That much I can tell you.
#822$#And for the record, I don't like Serena, not at all!|
52806|#824$#Ever seen an eclipse? I come from the dark side of the moon...|
52811|Are you a Moonlight Maiden, too?|
52812|Were you born on the moon?|
52813|#821$#Wait! You're not comparing me to that catty sister of mine, are you?
#824$#That's it! You're getting the silent treatment for the next... two hours!|
52814|#821$#They say Serena was born in the moonlight while I was born in the moon's shadow...
#822$#I suppose that makes us two sides of the same coin in a way. Alike in some ways but completely opposite in others.|
52815|#824$#How dare you ask me something like that!|
52816|#824$#You're just trying to piss me off, aren't you?|
52821|Could I take a look at your Picture Book?|
52822|How about showing me your Picture Book?|
52823|#824$#How rude! Unless you plan on telling me YOUR deepest, dark secrets, I think not!|
52824|#824$#Hmph! Talk about an invasion of privacy! I'm a respectable lady, you know!|
52825|#821$#You'd probably be bored by it anyway. It's just a bunch of doodles.|
52826|#822$#As if!|
52831|Your dress is so cute!|
52832|You look absolutely adorable in that.|
52833|#821$#Of course, it is! It's my motto, you know. Look sharp, BE sharp!|
52834|#822$#Oh? I'm glad you like it. I put a lot of thought in my style...|
52835|#821$#Ohoho! That is because I actually take things like fashion seriously! Not like that catty sister of mine.
#824$#What? Serena has a nice figure?! And what about ME?! I'm the one standing right in front of you!|
52836|#821$#I can make any outfit look divine!|
52841|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
52842|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
52843|#821$#You know that Serena HATES Aelius, right? Crazy! But I think he's sweet.
#823$#That and he plays the meanest harp this side of the continent!|
52844|#821$#You know Gigas, right? He has an amazing voice! Almost as good as mine.
#824$#It almost shames me to admit how good he is... ahh, what an angel...|
52845|#821$#One flap of Alucard's wings makes the very earth shake!
#824$#Can you imagine what it must be like for him just stretching his wings in the morning?|
52846|#822$#I swear that Hel must work out every day. I did ask her once...
#821$#Apparently she's just a natural, though. It's like she can move without thinking!|
52851|Do you know Aelius?|
52852|What do you think of Aelius?|
52853|#823$#Have you heard Aelius play his harp? The way he moves his fingers is to DIE for!
#821$#I've been trying to recruit him for my band,
#824$#but he seems more interested in patching things up with Serena.|
52854|#821$#Aelius? He's a great guy!
#823$#Could use a pair of rabbit ears though. I think Serena would forgive him in a heartbeat then!|
52855|#823$#Ohoho! I see what you're asking here...
#821$#But Aelius and I are just friends, truly. Did I disappoint you?|
52856|#822$#Not only is Aelius a fine piece of man, he can even play the harp! Talk about heartthrob!
#821$#Don't get snippy though. I promise you're still my favorite!|
52861|Who else is in your band?|
52862|You have a band?|
52863|#822$#H-hey! Not so loud!! How did you even hear about my band?!|
52864|#821$#My band is nothing if not awesome! Gretel rocks out on the horn and Hansel sets the tambourine on fire!
#824$#Though Hansel's asked if he could change instruments... as if! We need that tinsel beat!|
52865|#823$#So you know about my band, hm? I'm surprised!
#821$#That being said, could you please keep it to yourself? We're not quite... ready to perform just yet...|
52866|#824$#I actually just kicked Uriel out of the band...
#821$#I simply can't have things being set on fire at the drop of a hat! It's a safety hazard!|
52871|Tell me about your moon!|
52872|That's one special moon you've got there!|
52873|#821$#I think of it as the dark side of the moon. The shadow behind the eclipse. Gives it more of an "edge."
#823$#I put in a lot of thought into the decoration, too. Pretty cool, don't you think?|
52874|#823$#It's positively stunning, wouldn't you agree? Serena's moon can't even compare!|
52875|#823$#The only one worthy of this moon is me, me, me!|
52876|#824$#Ohoho, you? Sit on my moon? Why, it would sink straight to the ground!|
52881|Do you have any regrets?|
52882|Any unhappy memories you'd like to forget?|
52883|#823$#Oh? Hmm... nothing worth mentioning. I'm as happy as they come!|
52884|#822$#I sometimes worry that God will turn his back on me. Children born of the darkness, you know...
#821$#Fortunately, I don't have to worry about that with you! You truly are my everything.|
52885|#824$#Nostalgia's for babies. I prefer to live in the moment!
#821$#Besides, no matter how dark it may get, dawn is never far off.
#822$#A new morning brings with it a new light.|
52886|#822$#Unhappy memories? Hmm...
#824$#I suppose if you abandoned me that would be a pretty unhappy memory.|
52891|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
52892|What's your plan after we part ways?|
52893|#822$#I suspect you'll have a hard time with it, but chin up! Cesela is always here to lend a helping hand!|
52894|#824$#What?! I refuse to even think about that!|
52895|#821$#I suppose if that really did happen, I'd simply spend more time with my band.
#823$#In fact, we might even go on a world tour! I'll be so popular, you'll constantly be reminded of how good you had it!|
52896|#822$#W-wait! Why are you asking me this?
#824$#You're not... really abandoning me, are you?|
53001|Is there anything that really breaks your heart?|
53002|What makes you sad?|
53003|#822$#What? Are you sad? Tell me what's making you sad!
#821$#Don't be sad, I'm here for you!|
53004|#825$#I'm the saddest when I have to see people I don't like, and... talk to them, and stuff. Ugh.
#826$#At least I can always punch them afterwards! That feels pretty good.
#821$#You know what I mean?|
53005|#825$#Yes. It breaks my heart when I have to answer stupid questions all day long. So why don't you give it a rest, huh?|
53006|#827$#What? Did someone make you sad? Tell me who! I'll go sort 'em out!|
53011|What do you look for in a partner?|
53012|What sort of people do you like?|
53013|#821$#Which qualities are important?|
53014|#825$#Hmm, I dunno. I guess I've never really thought about it.
#822$#Afraid of fire?! Not at all. I could hardly be much use as an adventurer if I were, don't you think?|
53015|#825$#Eh? What's that? Don't tell me you have a crush on someone!
#823$#Hahahahaha! I don't think you're gonna get too far. With a face like yours, I'm probably the only companion you'll ever have!|
53016|#823$#Hahaha! Are you serious? Haha. Bealdor warned me you were going to ask that.
#825$#Huh? He told me you love asking weird and stupid questions.|
53021|Oh yes... Speaking of battles...|
53022|I've heard you're a real demon on the battlefield!|
53023|#823$#Ah...! Nothing can match the glory and wonder of battle, it's the only thing that make me really feel alive!|
53024|#825$#The scent of blood in the air.
#821$#All the screams and filth and fear.
#827$#I can't wait to get a-killing! All right then, let's go!|
53025|#826$#I'll let you hide behind me if you meet a powerful enemy!
#827$#Don't worry, I won't let you get hurt! What are you cowering for? Are you afraid of a little fire?
#821$#Don't be silly. My flame isn't going to hurt you! What do you think I am, some sort of amateur?|
53026|#827$#I know how to wield it properly. What else would I do, use it to cook?|
53031|What's your favorite weather?|
53032|What's your favorite season?|
53033|#826$#Definitely a sunny day! Nothing beats flying on a sunny day!
#825$#Of course, even if it rains, my Divine Flame won't be affected. Didn't you know that?|
53034|#824$#Rainy days are so boring!|
53035|#825$#I don't know so much about seasons... The city I live in doesn't really have seasons. The weather stays the same year-round.
#823$#But the summer is nice and hot in Terra! Just how I like it!|
53036|#824$#I usually hate rainy days! But sometimes it's nice, as long as I'm indoors. I like to listen to the raindrops...
#825$#What about you? What type of weather do you like?|
53041|What's your most memorable experience?|
53042|Did anything ever happen to you that was simply unforgettable?|
53043|#824$#There were indeed some difficult battles in the earlier quests...
#821$#But they all ended up going okay!|
53044|#825$#Don't just keep asking about me! I want to hear your stories too! Share with me, tell me something funny to cheer me up!|
53045|#825$#I'll never forget the first time when you and I fought together. You were so powerful in battle!
#823$#We really made a great team. I felt like we had an instinctual understanding. It was great!
#821$#Come on! Take me out again soon so we can fight together! Let's do it!|
53046|#825$#I was actually surprised to see you for the first time! You were a lot weaker than I was expecting...
#821$#All the Eidolons had said you were a good fighter.
#827$#I must admit, it was a bit of a letdown when you walked out looking all puny like a dweeb. I suppose perhaps I've just set my standards too high...|
53051|Have you ever been to Emerald Marsh?|
53052|What's it like?|
53053|#822$#Well, as far as marshes go, I'd say it's very marshy... If I had a choice, I would choose to not go...
#824$#But I suppose I can accompany you if you really want to go.|
53054|#824$#It's hot, sticky and wet...
#827$#Basically, it's not very cool at all.|
53055|#825$#That place is so damp. I don't understand why anyone would want to live there...
#827$#But it's always interesting to explore new places! We should go check it out|
53056|#822$#Not a fan! I really don't like wet places...
#825$#Everyone tells me that the Emerald Marsh is so beautiful...
#821$#But I really don't like it at all! You'll see why if you ever go visit.|
53061|Are you familiar with the Sky Realm?|
53062|What could you tell me about it?|
53063|#825$#The Sky Realm? Isn't it the same as the Sky Tower?
#822$#It's not the same?! What?! Then why does it have such a similar name?|
53064|#825$#Legend has it that a hidden memory will present itself there in the form of a phantom...
#826$#It's definitely worth going there!|
53065|#821$#In any case, it's definitely the perfect place for battles!|
53066|#823$#Battle, battle, battle!
#821$#I know! It's just a bunch of people trying to challenge a powerful boss!
#826$#The Sky Realm is just as exciting as the Sky Tower!|
53071|Have there been any recent events?|
53072|Are there any special quests we can go on?|
53073|#825$#Have you checked out the location indicated by a star on the map?
#821$#Using the map is a basic necessity for adventurers!|
53074|#827$#Instead of partaking in events, I prefer to enter instances and fight against evil Monsters!
#826$#Move! We shall head out!|
53075|#822$#Hmm... I'm not too sure about that.|
53076|#824$#I'd say we ask the Mirabelle Association Clerk about quests.|
53081|Can you teach me how to cook?|
53082|Have you researched cooking at all?|
53083|#821$#Haha! You're asking the right person. Cooking is my innate talent.
#826$#I've got your daily meals taken care of!|
53084|#825$#It's very simple. All you need to do is get the ingredients, and then mix them all together!
#826$#Lastly, all you need to do is heat everything up! And voila, so you're done!
#827$#Not enough fire... Here's everything that you wanted!|
53085|#825$#Each city has its cooking specialists. You can ask them.
#822$#Wait! Don't try to tell me that you wanted to cook on your own! Now you're just being silly!|
53086|#822$#I never thought you'd be the type of person that can cook for themselves.
#825$#Eating cooked food seems to be good for your health, though. You should try it!|
53091|Could you tell me the trick to fishing?|
53092|How much do you know about fishing?|
53093|#821$#Just dam up the river! Then you can get as many fish as you want!
#822$#Why can't you do that? Then how do you get the fish?|
53094|#825$#If you choose the correct fishing bait, you might even be able to catch some special fish types!|
53095|#821$#Instead of asking me, you should ask the people at Anglers Anonymous. I believe they'll know more about fishing than I do.
#827$#You can always ask me anything regarding battles though!|
53096|#826$#You have to try everything once! Go!|
53101|That thing about left and right hands?|
53102|Benevolence and justice?|
53103|#825$# If the right hand represents benevolence, the left hand represents justice. Which is your preference?
#822$#Ah! Still can't learn her ways.
#821$#Me! Two fists represent damage and destruction. Of course, there are people would who call this redemption.|
53104|#822$#The only person who would really be into this is Uzuriel,
#825$#but he has to know that there's a need for justice first.|
53105|#824$#I will pretend you didn't ask that.|
53106|#825$#The right hand represents benevolence, and if you believe that, you will receive benevolence.
#827$#But, whether you believe it or not, the justice that is represented by the left hand shall prevail!
#821$#God is so unreasonable, much like you humans, isn't that right?|
53111|You're pretty skilled!|
53112|Your attacking skills are so powerful!|
53113|#821$#As long as you continue to hone your skills, you'll be able to do it!
#826$#Plus I'll be supporting you! When you need me most, I will protect you!|
53114|#826$#I am a part of this group, after all. If that's not strong enough...
#822$#Hmm? Oops! Slip of the tongue... Could you forget that?|
53115|#821$#Haha! I have some thoughts about your attacking style.
#827$#Perhaps we could compare notes. If you don't care, I'll turn you into charcoal!
#823$#Hahaha, just kidding! That look of worry on your face! You look so cute!|
53116|#824$#Under these conditions... No, you don't need to know that.
#825$#If I say too much, I might cause you unnecessary trouble.|
53121|I heard that you once joined the Moonshadow band.|
53122|You formed a band?|
53123|#822$#Yes... But there was one day when I was so happy that I accidentally burnt down the whole venue.
#825$#And Cesela never talked to me after that.
#821$#I was only trying my best to brighten up the place!|
53124|#821$#What? Your news travels fast!
#827$#Don't look at me like that. I'm a talented singer and good at other things too!|
53125|#823$#Haha! Is Cesela still in the band?
#825$#I heard that she found Gigas for the position of male vocalist. How should I say this?
#821$#I think that Cesela come looking for me again soon!|
53126|#823$#Do you like music at all? Haha! Don't you like that?
#826$#That way we can form a band. I'm a good singer!|
53131|What about the Fire of God?|
53132|What about the Light of God?|
53133|#823$#Wow! Where did you hear about that? How embarrassing!|
53134|#825$#Haha! It's just a title, like God's Left-hand Man.
#827$#But... My flame now burns for a greater purpose.|
53135|#827$#My flame can be used for destruction, but also can bring a light of hope.
#821$#But for now, the flame exists to protect you.|
53136|#821$#Wherever the flame goes, it burns away sin, and purifies evil.
#827$#But with good, there's bad. I am both savior and death!
#823$#Wahaha! No, I can't help but laugh out loud!|
53141|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolon?|
53142|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolon.|
53143|#825$#I'm going to tell you a secret. Uzuriel and I both come from...
#822$#Oh! Never mind. I can't bring myself to speak those words. Something might happen to you because of this and it'll be my fault.
#826$#Even if they come for you, I will still protect you!|
53144|#825$#I heard that the original Hansel and Gretel house is hidden in another world - somewhere in books.
#823$#That's cool! That's REALLY cool! I am so envious!
#827$#Then I am the raging Hellfire that transforms into the Heavenly Defender! Bahaha! Never mind!|
53145|#825$#Astraea and Diao Chan are always practicing together in order to enhance their combat skills.
#821$#Every time I try to join them, Diao Chan always tells me to look for Alucard or Bealdor.
#822$#I don't understand why. Why do I have to be with them?|
53146|#826$#I think Hel is a very attractive girl!
#825$#But every time I talk to her, I always feel like Bealdor is looking at me strangely.
#822$#Hmm. What should I say to Bealdor?|
53151|Do you know Uriel?|
53152|How is Uriel?|
53153|#824$#Already dead. Please don't bring up that name again.|
53154|#825$#How do you know this name? Those who know it are usually... well...
#824$#Just forget that name. Don't say that I didn't warn you.|
53155|#827$#During quests, don't call me Uriel.
#826$#You should've already known that! The true colors of Uriel!|
53156|#822$#This... Should I say knew it, or not?|
53161|Always avoiding you, Uzuriel.|
53162|Is Uzuriel avoiding you?|
53163|#824$#Just let her keep avoiding me.|
53164|#825$#I'm not too bothered about what happened, but Uzuriel seems to be caught up in the past.
#826$#One day she'll have to face up to it and she'll have to explain herself.|
53165|#822$#Ah?! Oh really? And here I thought that I was over-thinking it.|
53166|#825$#Really? I didn't really pay much attention to that.|
53171|Why are your wings black?|
53172|What do the black wings represent?|
53173|#825$#If you had the option, would you choose the white wings or the black ones?
#826$#I think that giving up the wings is just trying to escape from reality.|
53174|#825$#Wings will definitely change from white to black after going through so many bloodbaths.
#827$#But I don't regret a thing!|
53175|#824$#It's probably one of the reasons why I've chosen to come here.|
53176|#826$#It represents determination with no regrets!
#825$#But... If there ever comes a day when I'm possessed by an evil power,
#827$#you'd help me, right? Just as I accompany you...|
53181|The boxing gloves accent these clothes really well!|
53182|You look good with those clothes!|
53183|#825$#First Clue! That mark on the boxing gloves looks awfully familiar.
#821$#Second Clue! I know you must've seen this mark somewhere.
#822$#Looks like it's Uzu... Ah! I accidentally said the answer...|
53184|#825$#Really? I'll just say this...
#821$#You're looking good! Your clothes really suit you.|
53185|#827$#Of course. Not only that, but they'll be able to withstand high temperatures!
#823$#They'd even withstand my flames!|
53186|#825$#Normally I'm not so interested in clothes,
#821$#but it's good that you like them. Your feedback matters!|
53191|Have you thought about what your life will be like after we part ways?|
53192|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
53193|#826$#Haha! It's a bit too early to say that!|
53194|#822$#Wah! That's a surprising question. Have I angered you in any way?
#825$#Don't be angry. Allow me to apologize!|
53195|#827$#Fret not. Those Monsters should just give up already!
#821$#I won't let you die on my watch.|
53196|#821$#With such a large world, why can't I find anywhere else to go?|
53301|What is time?|
53302|What is time to you?|
53303|#821$#Time is a series of paths and trapdoors. Once you open a door, you can never go back. You must always be certain which door you must open, and which you should leave untouched.|
53304|#823$# I am still curious...what is time to you? Be specific.|
53305|#822$# Time is the essence of my being. When you observe the passage of time, you realize the power you hold.
#821$# I have seen birth and I have recorded destruction... With one simple decision, any of these events could have been changed.|
53306|#821$#Even in your short lifespan, you have the choice to drastically alter the course of history.
#822$# But me, with my vast lifespan.. The passage of time unfurls before me like a blank canvas, waiting to be painted. But I am not one for intervention... I choose instead to observe, and to record...
#821$# Do you fault me for this?|
53311|What are your thoughts on life?|
53312|What about death?|
53313|#2$# Everyone's life is worth recording... even the most evil people.|
53314|#821$# Wow, getting really in to the deep philosophical questions now, aren't we... Well, what do you think?|
53315|#821$# Death doesn't have to be an ending, just as birth isn't necessarily a beginning.
#822$# I don't know... Maybe I've just seen so much. Life, death, these are but footnotes in the index of a single book.|
53316|#821$# Look up, and you'll see an entire library. That is the fascination of the infinite.
#823$# Still, nothing will ever beat the moment when I met you... Hehehehe.|
53321|What's your favorite season?|
53322|Which season do you like best?|
53323|#821$# Recently, I've become quite enamored with Winter.
#823$# Since meeting you, I've realized that the world is far more wondrous than I ever gave it credit for before.|
53324|#2$#...
#821$#Oh...um... Sorry, I must have misheard. What was the question?|
53325|#821$# The seasons pass like an hourglass... Each year passes, you flip the glass and it all restarts.
#823$# It comes and goes, each day but a grain of sand. I do love that moment when you finally get to flip the hourglass!|
53326|#823$#But enough about me! Tell me which season you like! Wait... Did I hear that right?
#2$# You're actually asking my opinion?|
53331|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
53332|C'mon! Tell me who it is!|
53333|#821$# It was a serendipitous moment. Let's just say, no matter how many millenia I live, I'll never forget it.
#823$#Are you curious about who it is?|
53334|#822$#Well, don't bother! I'll never tell. Now scram, I'm updating my databases. 13.5%... 13.6%...
#823$#You're the only person I really care for!|
53335|#821$# So, do you know anything about those angels?
#822$# I hope they'll stop their fighting soon and make up.
#824$# But I hope you won't tell them I said that! I don't like it when people spread my opinions around.|
53336|#824$# What's that? Think harder! You can probably answer your own question.
#821$#Well... Did you come up with the same answer as me?|
53341|What's your most memorable experience?|
53342|Any unforgettable memories?|
53343|#821$# I never forget anything. All my memories are permanent. So I can't really answer your question.
#823$#But exploring and adventuring together, I feel we create many lasting and special moments!|
53344|#822$# When you have a memory as vast as mine, it takes something special to stand out.
#821$# But you and me, we make such a good team, I think we might just go down in history!
#823$#We could even write a book about our adventures! Or maybe not... whatever.|
53345|#821$# A while back... I had this amazing adventure with Alucard. He used to be a lot different in those days.
#823$# Ah well, we all change over time, don't we?|
53346|#824$# I can't answer that question, it's too personal.
#821$# Ask me again when you're a little older, haha.  |
53351|Do you have your own Guardian Knight?|
53352|Do you know of the Guardian Knights?|
53353|#821$#Guardian Knights... What are those, again
#822$# Interesting question. I've always found human relationships so bizarre. You fight, you make up, you love, you hate.|
53354|#821$# Two people who are willing to protect each other out of mutual love and respect.
#823$# There is much to respect about such an arrangement.|
53355|#822$#......Hm? Guardian Knight, did you say...?
#821$# I'm sorry. I wasn't paying attention. I was studying up for the Aura Kingdom Quiz. Have you taken it before?
#823$# Since you like asking questions so much, maybe you'd be interested.|
53356|#821$# My very own Guardian Knight.. Is that what you are?|
53361|Do you know anything about Shuriken?|
53362|What can you tell me about Shuriken?.|
53363|#821$# I am not an expert on weapons... But I'll let you know if I hear anything.
#822$# Shuriken? Those fancy star thingies? Is that what you mean?|
53364|#821$#I don't really know. Maybe you should ask Tsubaki instead.|
53365|#822$#Sorry, I wasn't listening. What did you ask?
#821$# Oh, shuriken!|
53366|#821$# It's a special Ninjutsu weapon. They're pretty sweet.
#2$# That's about all I know, though. Although, if you are interested, I suppose I could collect some information...|
53371|Can you tell me anything about the Sky Tower?|
53372|Please tell me about the Sky Tower.|
53373|#821$# Ah, the Sky Tower... so majestic. It really is a miracle.
#822$# Huh? Why do you want to know about that? Oh, I see. You're interested in the treasure inside, aren't you..
#823$# Yes, I've heard it's a very precious treasure.|
53374|#821$#Ah yes, the Sky Tower. It's a bit like my library, chock full of ancient historical accounts and records.
#823$#Shall we go explore it together?|
53375|#822$#What? Sky Tower? Sorry, never heard of it.|
53376|#821$# Have you been there? Maybe you can tell me about it. Let me get a pen and paper!
#2$# I want to record this.|
53381|What is this Housing I keep hearing about?|
53382|Can you tell me anything about Housing?|
53383|#822$# Let's see... Housing... So, you have this house, okay? And you can decorate it, and--what?
#824$# You knew already? Then why are you asking me?|
53384|#821$# Housing offers you a personal space. It's a home away from home.
#822$# Looking for beachfront property? You should try putting you house in Port Skandia!|
53385|#822$# Housing? Are you asking me to move in with you? Aren't you moving a little fast?
#821$#Maybe we should take things a bit slower. I like you, but I don't LIKE you like you.|
53386|#821$# Your home is your castle, that's what I always say! Although, knowing you, it's a messy castle.
#823$# You should definitely hire a Housekeeper, for all our sakes!|
53391|What is Eidolon purification?|
53392|I heard something about Eidolon purification. Do you know what it is?|
53393|#821$# It's a way for me to share my power with you to exchange abilities.
#822$# But the energy created is so unstable, a lot of the time it can't be harnessed correctly.|
53394|#822$# I don't understand why anyone would want to try this "purification" technique. It just sounds so weird.
#821$# But if you say that the new ability could help you, I suppose I'd allow myself to be purified.|
53395|#821$# Through purification, we Eidolon can produce different abilities to help you.
#822$# But since your energy is not stable enough... I don't think you're ready to try it out yet.|
53396|#824$#What? I'm not pure enough for you?
#823$# Why don't you go purify your face! Then we can talk about purification.
#821$# Purification, indeed! The gall!|
53401|Why did you come to Terra?|
53402|What was your reason for coming here?|
53403|#821$# I have lived for so long., and seen so much. I needed a change.
#823$# And with you, I think I've found what I was looking for!|
53404|#821$# Maybe that was fate... or maybe just a coincidence. Does it matter?|
53405|#824$# Poking into my past, are you? Who do you think you are, my psychologist?
#821$#I do what I want! That's all you need to know about it.|
53406|#821$# I came here because it was my fate.
#823$# Destiny has brought us together. Can't you feel it?|
53411|Could you introduce yourself?|
53412|Tell me a little bit about yourself.|
53413|#822$# I am Timekeeper, Eternia.
#821$#Your ticking lord of time. Glad to meet you!|
53414|#821$# I am Eternia, master of time and knowledge.
#822$# But that doesn't mean I have the time to answer all of your questions, okay?|
53415|#822$# I'm Eternia! Don't you even know that?
#821$# Introduce myself? No thanks, intros are for suckers! If you really want to know, go read about me online, fool!|
53416|#821$# Exqueeze me? I have unlimited knowledge. You're going to waste your question on asking me my NAME?|
53421|You know so much!|
53422|Is there anything you don't know?|
53423|#821$# I have a library full of tomes of all topics.
#823$# If you are interested, I could show you around.|
53424|#2$# Honestly? Nope, I'm pretty much a walking encyclopedia.
#823$# The only thing I don't know a lot about... is you!|
53425|#822$# Yeah, there is one thing I've been wondering.
#821$# Magnets! How do they work? It must be some kind of miracle!|
53426|#823$# You think I'm really a genius? Well, I guess maybe I am...
#821$# At least compared to you!|
53431|I've been wondering about your relationship with Tanith.|
53432|Do you know Tanith?|
53433|#821$# Tanith? Yes, I know her. But it's been a long time. How is she?|
53434|#824$# Tanith? Why do you ask? Did something happen to her?|
53435|#822$# Tanith? What Tanith? I know not this Tanith of whom you speak.
#821$#Oh, that Tanith!
#823$# Yes, I know who you mean now. I may have spoken to her once or twice.|
53436|#821$# Tanith and I knew each other long ago. I don't know if she would still remember me.|
53441|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
53442|So... Any juicy Eidolon gossip?|
53443|#822$# What is the relationship between Hel and Ayako? ... I'm not really sure.
#821$#I don't really keep up with their lives on a daily basis, you know? They are family. You are nosier than I thought!|
53444|#822$# What about Uriel and Uzuriel? That's none of your business!
#821$#What a little gossip you are! You really think I'm going to tell you about that?
#824$# Why don't you ask them yourself, if you want to know so badly! Little twerp...|
53445|#822$# What about Alucard and Bealdor? I don't know anything about that!
#821$#As far as I know, they don't have any sort of special relationship. You're such a little conspiracy theorist! You always think everyone's up to something, don't you!|
53446|#821$# Did you know that Uriel used to be the guitarist in a famous Eidolon rock band? He used to travel far and wide. You should hear his stories!
#2$# He had tons of groupies! But he doesn't really talk about that anymore.|
53451|Are you short-sighted?|
53452|I see you wearing glasses sometimes.|
53453|#822$#I like wearing my glasses. Don't you think they make me look sophisticated?|
53454|#2$# I feel like such an intellectual when I wear them. Like, 'oh indeed! Indubitably! Let me fetch my spectacles!'
#822$# But the lenses are just transparent. There's no prescription at all! Haha.|
53455|#824$# Are you calling me a four eyes? I might have glasses, but you must be blind going out dressed in that ridiculous get-up!|
53456|#821$# Oh, so I suppose you have 20/20 vision, do you? How many fingers am I holding up then?
#2$# That's right. One is correct.|
53461|That's a pretty neat weapon you've got there!|
53462|I've never seen a weapon like that before.|
53463|#821$# It's magic. Don't you have a grimoire?
#823$#You know. Enchantments and spells 'n stuff. You say some crazy words, and smoke and flames pop out. It's magic!|
53464|#821$# You mean my Eternal Starstone?|
53465|#821$# Yeah, pretty, isn't it? I love looking at it. Sometimes I have to remind myself its true purpose.|
53466|#823$# Oh, you like it? Here, take a look. The stone in the middle is a star fragment. It comes from an ancient world located thousands of light years away.|
53471|Are you a good fighter?|
53472|Show me some moves!|
53473| #824$#Am I a good fighter? Try the BEST fighter!|
53474|#822$# Well, I'm pretty good. I think I can make myself useful to you!|
53475|#821$# Well, I don't like to rush headfirst into the fray. But I can definitely help you out!
#2$#Give me a target, and I'll smash 'em up for you!|
53476|#824$# You don't think I'm tough? Maybe we should have a little duel... if you're not chicken!
#821$#Even Alucard's no match for me.|
53481|You're a lot cuter than I was expecting.|
53482|You're actually kind of attractive, in your own special way.|
53483|#823$# Well, gee, thanks. It's always nice to get a compliment!|
53484|#821$# I don't even know what I look like, can you believe it? Is it true I look like a three-headed snake, with the heads of a human, a cow, and a lion?
#2$# Or was that just a rumor someone spread? I never know what to believe.
#821$# Please tell me!|
53485|#824$# Humph! You only compliment me when you want something. Out with it. Tell me what you really want...|
53486|#821$# Wow, that's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me! Thanks. You don't look so bad, yourself.|
53491|Have you thought about how your life will be after we've parted ways?|
53492|What's your plan for the future?|
53493|#821$# I don't think that day will come anytime soon, unless you decide you want it to. But, seeing as how I'm basically the master of time,
#823$#I can be happy doing pretty much anything. I'm not going anywhere!|
53494|#823$# Haha, that question simply shows me your ignorance. Time is a great cycle! We've met before, in past lives, and we'll meet again!
#821$#Even if it takes a thousand years, I can wait. I am the Goddess of Time, after all!|
53495|#821$# I will go back to where I came from, and continue recording the events of the world...
#823$# Don't worry, I believe we will meet again.|
53496|#821$# Are you trying to get rid of me? If you have other plans, I won't stand in your way.
#2$# But please allow me to continue protecting you from afar.|
53601|Do you gravitate toward a certain kind of person?|
53602|What's your type?|
53603|#823$# Why is master so interested in Diao Chan's romantic relationships?
#821$#Diao Chan's crush should be common knowledge...|
53604|#822$# Love knows no bounds!|
53605|#823$# Diao Chan really admires people like master.|
53606|#824$# Is master trying to find a partner for Diao Chan?|
53611|Have you ever been in love?|
53612|Have you ever had a boyfriend?|
53613|#821$#For Diao Chan, love isn't just about chasing guys...
#822$#Diao Chan thinks master might have similar views on that.|
53614|#822$#Few things feel better than a warm hug. Has master found a partner?|
53615|#822$# Would master would believe that Diao Chan has never been in a relationship?|
53616|#821$#Well, Does master want to take a guess?
#822$#If master guesses correctly, master will get a gift! What do you say?|
53621|Are you a good fighter?|
53622|Do you hesitate when the time comes to dive into combat?|
53623|#823$# Don't underestimate Diao Chan. Master, don't look at Diao Chan that way!
#821$#Fighting is one of the three things that Diao Chan does best!
#822$#What are the other two? Master will find out soon enough...|
53624|#821$#Fighting is easy when master is around!
#822$#Master would never leave Diao Chan alone, right?|
53625|#824$# If master doesn't protect Diao Chan, things are going to go downhill...|
53626|#822$# Don't worry, Diao Chan will protect you!|
53631|Do you like to travel?|
53632|What are your opinions on traveling?|
53633|#824$# Diao Chan's feet are so sore! Maybe master will carry her...
#822$# What's going on? Is master blushing?|
53634|#821$#Traveling gives you the chance to experience different cultures. Diao Chan really enjoys it!|
53635|#821$#Traveling with master is definitely a pleasure!
#825$#Diao Chan wonders if master feels the same...|
53636|#823$# Diao Chan likes master. Um... Diao Chan likes doing things together with master.
#822$# Master's ears are turning red! What were you thinking about?|
53641|What do you usually do for fun?|
53642|Do you have a favorite hobby?|
53643|#825$# Actually, Diao Chan really likes to read books and play chess.
#821$#Not to brag, but no one has ever beaten her at chess!|
53644|#822$#Don't just ask about Diao Chan the whole time - tell me about master's hobbies, too!
#821$#Do master and Diao Chan have any hobbies in common?|
53645|#821$#Diao Chan usually reads books and plays chess with Vayu. Diao Chan always wins!
#822$#Vayu said that Diao Chan is a very talented strategist. Does master agree?|
53646|#822$#Diao Chan likes drinking tea and chatting with friends.
#823$#Oh! Will master accompany Diao Chan to the next tea party?
#821$#Diao Chan hasn't heard about Shirayuki's hometown...|
53651|Tell me about the city of Navea.|
53652|What do you think of Navea?|
53653|#821$#Diao Chan has heard Navea is an important city in Midgard. Is that true?
#822$#The Sky Tower is located there; it contains ancient treasures from all over the world!|
53654|#821$#It's a beautiful place where adventurers from all walks of life gather.
#822$#Diao Chan would like to visit as soon as her work here is done. Won't that be great?|
53655|#821$#The place is a cultural melting pot with a long, rich history. It sounds wonderful!  
#822$#It's completely normal to see Makar and dwarves in Navea.|
53656|#822$#There's also supposed to be a shop in the city that sells delicious snacks! Diao Chan wonders if it's true...|
53661|What do dwarves look like?|
53662|I'd like to know more about the dwarven race.|
53663|#821$#The dwarves are known for being masters of robotics and crafting.
#822$#Their robots help them complete tasks which would require them to be a bit... taller.
#823$# The dwarves are a powerful race, indeed!|
53664|#821$#There is supposed to be a dwarf tribe living in the Cactakara Forest. Do you think we could go visit them?|
53665|#822$# To be honest, sometimes Diao Chan can't tell the difference between dwarves and goblins.|
53666|#821$#The dwarves seem to always hide their faces behind veils... Why do they do that?
#822$#Diao Chan wants to see their faces!|
53671|Can you tell me about Silent Ice Field?|
53672|What's the Silent Ice Field like?|
53673|#821$#It's a very, very cold place - it has a deep sense of sorrow that penetrates to your core.|
53674|#821$#It's a land of eternal winter. Doesn't Shirayuki's hometown have similar weather patterns?|
53675|#822$#The monsters there are very strong. It would be dangerous to go without a guide!|
53676|#821$#A place completely consumed by snow and silence...
#822$#It's kind of romantic, doesn't master agree?|
53681|How should I choose my path on the Envoy's Path?|
53682|What is the Envoy's Path?|
53683|#821$#The Envoy's Path allows you to acquire new combat techniques...
#822$#It seems like master hasn't yet decided on a path to take.
#823$#It's makes Diao Chan a little nervous, but Diao Chan will support whatever decision master makes.|
53684|#823$#If master likes treasure, why not try walking down the Path of Greed?|
53685|#821$#Skills that master uses often are the best candidates for the upgrade path.
#823$#Master thinks every skill should be improved to the highest level...|
53686|#821$#It's important that you choose the path that fits you best.
#822$#Don't let others influence master's decision!|
53691|I want to know about skill mastery!|
53692|Could you tell me more about skill mastery?|
53693|#823$# Master's drive to improve is impressive!
#822$#Let's take a little breather before we head to the the Emerald Marsh.
#821$#We'll discuss skill mastery next time. Sound all right?|
53694|#821$#Skill mastery? That's the way to go about perfecting master's current skills.  
#822$#Master is already so powerful, even without having maxed everything out...
#823$# Diao Chan bets master would be the best in the world if that were the case!|
53695|#821$#If master has tokens, maser can buy skill masteries in Navea.
#822$#Master is the best - Diao Chan doesn't even care about unmastered skills!|
53696|#824$#Ouch! There's sand in Diao Chan'S eyes...|
53701|Where are you from?|
53702|Can you tell me about your hometown?|
53703|#821$#Diao Chan comes from an eastern land. Our culture is completely different from the one here.
#822$#Diao Chan misses her home, but master is more than worth staying here for!|
53704|#821$#It's been so long since she's been home, she doesn't think she can quite picture what it looks like.|
53705|#822$#Enough about Diao Chan -  talk more about master!|
53706|#821$#Diao Chan comes from a far-off eastern land.
#822$#She thinks master would like her hometown...|
53711|Do you know those two guys over there?|
53712|The ones who tried to talk to you?|
53713|#824$#They're only interested in Diao Chan's looks.|
53714|#823$# Master is so wise...
#822$#Diao Chan has no particular relationship with them. Does master have a special relationship?|
53715|#821$#Master shouldn't be fooled by beauty.
#822$#That said, does the master still trust Diao Chan?|
53716|#825$#Master should not bring up ancient history...|
53721|You use a fan as a weapon?|
53722|Could you tell me more about your weapon?|
53723|#821$#This fan is has an ancient power within it.
#822$#Diao Chan loves it and takes it everywhere she goes.|
53724|#821$#When she wields it, she can summon the wind to attack the enemy.
#823$# Master should let Diao Chan do the dirty work!|
53725|#821$#Using a fan as a weapon is rare where Diao Chan comes from.
#822$#Really, it's not that hard to summon the wind. You just have to know how to handle a fan!|
53726|#823$#Haha! Let me fan you a bit.|
53731|Your clothes are very unique.|
53732|They look very good on you!|
53733|#823$#Ah! You do have a way with words, Master!
#821$#I have to dress up because I am coming with you on your journey! Does that make you happy?|
53734|#821$#But... isn't this style a bit too foreign for me?|
53735|#824$#Now, now... don't just look at Diao Chan's clothes!
#822$#Try to focus on Diao Chan's inner beauty! That is where her genuine beauty comes from.|
53736|#823$#Oh, really? It makes me happy that you like it! To think... Astraea tried to tell me that my skirt was too short.|
53741|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
53742|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolons.|
53743|#822$#Cesela and Serena look just alike. Some say that they are twins,
#821$#but they've never confirmed it.
#823$# Why not let me find out? I might be able to get some answers!|
53744|#821$#Alucard always speaks in the most refined tone... Even when he's talking to me.
#822$#Goodness, finding a man who can stay this calm when talking to me is... quite rare!
#823$#Hey! Doesn't look directly in my eyes like Bealdor does! Tee hee! |
53745|#821$#Cleopawtra is certainly a deadly character...
#823$#And while you mention it... I bet her relationship with Tigerius Caesar is quite exciting, too!
#822$#Master must be careful! Don't get taken in by her charm... You already have me, you know.|
53746|#821$#Cyril is a very positive person... but somehow I always feel a bit tense when dealing with him.
#822$#I think I would prefer someone less positive and more relaxed!|
53751|Do you have any wishes?|
53752|Will you make a wish if I let you?|
53753|#821$#Wishes... I think mine has already come true!
#822$#Because I've found someone that I can rely on... Haven't I?|
53754|#825$#Please don't laugh at my answer, Master...
#822$#I wish for peace and prosperity everywhere in the world! No more war...|
53755|#821$#I wish... I wish to be with you forever!
#822$#To be in your service forever - that is Diao Chan's dream...|
53756|#821$#This question... Does it mean that Master wants to help my dreams come true?|
53761|Tell me a story.|
53762|Do you think I should tell a story?|
53763|#821$#A long time ago, miracle child was born in a small fishing port. He was granted a mysterious power...
#822$#As fate would have it, he went on a long journey, where he witnessed a great many things...
#823$#And then... he met the woman of his dreams. And that... is Diao Chan.|
53764|#821$#Yes... A long time ago, there was a region that was ravaged by wars. Every single country wanted to be ruler of the region.
#822$#And there was one... one incredibly evil power who had made only enemies for himself.
#821$#But a lady came along and used her beauty to drive a wedge between him and his general.
#825$#Master, do you know why she would have done that?|
53765|#823$#Haha... Master is like a child at times...
#821$#But what type of story does Master like to hear?|
53766|#823$#Ah! Aren't all of Master's experiences legendary tales in their own right?
#821$#How about it? Let me help Master collect these stories and make them into a memoir. What do you think?
#822$#Don't underestimate Diao Chan. She's an awfully good writer... and her penmanship is excellent!|
53771|Do you know Kotonoha?|
53772|How is Kotonoha related to you?|
53773|#822$#Why do you ask?
#821$#Diao Chan is not related to that fox!|
53774|#821$#Does my question... make you think of anything in particular?
#823$Ha! Looking at Master's facial expression, Diao Chan seems to have hit the nail on the head!|
53775|#821$#She's a nice, gentle young lady...
#822$#We get along well! But... she's also a love rival.|
53776|#824$#Boohooohooo... does master love Diao Chan or Kotonoha?|
53781|What do you think makes for a great outfit?|
53782|Any secrets to dressing well?|
53783|#823$#Ha! Master is still attractive, even without dressing up!
#822$#But if you dress up nicely, won't Diao Chan have even more rivals to compete with?|
53784|#821$#Eat well, get enough rest, and be sure to exercise. Those are the best ways to stay in shape!
#822$#It will make you look good without doing anything more!|
53785|#821$#Why does Master want to dress up? Don't tell me that you are in love with someone else!
#824$#No! You wouldn't do that to Diao Chan...|
53786|#821$#Actually, as long as you feel good, you will look good. The most important thing is to have self-confidence!|
53791|Have you thought about what your life will be like after we part ways?|
53792|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
53793|#825$#Why? Why would Master suddenly...
#824$#Booo hoo hooo!!|
53794|#821$#Don't underestimate Diao Chan. What makes you think I wait around here at your beck and call?
#822$#Diao Chan will be with you until... until the end of Diao Chan's life!!!|
53795|#822$#Yes! Even if it's just a joke, you can't just say it out loud whenever you want...
#821$#But if that's how it is... It's time to go back to my hometown!|
53796|#821$#Don't say that... Diao Chan can't take a joke!|
53901|What's your favorite weather?|
53902|What's your favorite season?|
53903|#821$#I've experienced all four seasons, and the one that left the deepest impression on me is Winter. Snow swirling through the air,
#823$#everything covered in ice and frost. I feel as though time stands still in moments like that.
#822$#I bet you prefer the brighter and warmer days of Spring and Summer! I guessed right, didn't I? I knew it!|
53904|#822$#I'm normally pretty apathetic about the seasons and the weather, but I do hate those rainy days.
#821$#I heard that the Fiery Angel isn't a big fan of rainy days either, but at least the raindrops don't affect the Divine Flame...
#824$#That's interesting... Perhaps I should learn more about the Divine Flame from the Fiery Angel!|
53905|#821$#The seasons? I prefer when there's a balance between hot and cold, and I can't stand the wind and rain.
#824$#You think that I'm too picky? No, I think that you just don't even care about that. Yep.|
53906|#822$#It's always sunny as long as I'm around. I am Amaterasu after all. Haha!|
53911|What do you do in your free time?|
53912|How do you like to kick back and relax?|
53913|#824$#I'm usually too busy to just relax... Yes.|
53914|#823$#I'm busy learning new things and assembling equipment. I'll go and fine Kusanagi whenever I've got some free time.
#821$#I'm really concerned that the Spirit of the Sword is in the mortal world!|
53915|#821$#I spoke to the Eidolon in the Eidolon Menu and I heard some interesting things... Yes.
#822$#For instance... Bealdor seems to have a crush on Hel... What?! How did you already know!?|
53916|#823$#I'm occasionally visited by the Spirit of the Sword and it tells me some interesting things... Yes.
#822$#For example, Gretel once accidentally blew up her house when she tried baking an apple pie...
#821$#Ah! Make sure to keep it a secret. She seems to have told her brother that it was blown up by the Divine Flame...|
53921|Are you a good fighter?|
53922|Do you like to fight?|
53923|#821$#I'm not much of a fighter, but during a battle... I'm definitely not going to lose to anyone!|
53924|#821$#Fighting? I know a lot about fighting! There was a time when I had a long fight against Typhon...
#824$#You must realize that it's a life or death fight. Even with a huge advantage, you can never let your guard down!
#821$#I won because Typhon was careless.|
53925|#821$#Why do you ask? Do you need my help?
#823$#Of course I can help you. It'll be an honor. Yes.|
53926|#821$#Are you telling me that you're not good at that?
#822$#I see. But I always thought that you were very strong... Or are there lots of people who are stronger than you?
#823$#Haha! That's impossible!|
53931|What are your thoughts on life?|
53932|What about death?|
53933|#821$#Life is like fire, when the oxygen is used up, the fire dies! Yes.
#823$#But what I love about humans is that they do their best to shine during their short lifespans.|
53934|#824$#I have seen so much throughout my lifetime, but I have no idea what happens when you die. Yes.|
53935|#824$#Since you're asking me, are you worried about death?
#821$#You shouldn't worry. You will die in glory.|
53936|#822$#Alternatively, you could try to live up to my age! Haha!|
53941|How does one deal with a powerful enemy?|
53942|What's the best strategy for dealing with a powerful enemy?|
53943|#823$#Don't worry! Just say my name and he won't dare hurt you!
#821$#...? Not many people in Terra know that I... In that case... Nevermind!
#823$#We have to face the enemy straightaway! We can beat anyone if we stick together! Yes.|
53944|#823$#Never show your fear to the enemy. I will always be there to protect you.
#822$#But... If things take a turn for the worst... It'll all be up to you... Haha! Just joking! Yes.|
53945|#824$#Able to survive under the rays of Helonia? I don't believe such a creature exists. Yes.
#822$#You're truly one of a kind! Yes. Haha!|
53946|#821$#I'm here to protect you. Control your fear and never give up!
#823$#If we work together and fight, we are invincibile.|
53951|Tell me about Candetonn Hill.|
53952|Do you know Candetonn Hill?|
53953|#821$#Is there anything I don't know? I am Amaterasu... Yes.
#822$#There's nothing that I haven't heard of. So, what are you asking?|
53954|#821$#Candetonn Hill? That's a very normal question.
#824$#But for someone who just arrived in Terra, there are bound to be things that I can't be too sure about.
#823$#Perhaps you can enlighten me about this Candetonn Hill that you've mentioned.|
53955|#822$#That place contains some mysterious powerful energy, even I can feel it from afar...
#821$#But I still have no idea about how to go about investigating the source of that energy. Perhaps I need to use the Power of Gaia that you were talking about.|
53956|#824$#There is an ancient magical power there, but my own power isn't strong enough to investigate the mystery behind it...
#821$#And yet I am able to feel the effects of this power on the world. How mysterious...|
53961|Do you know what the Cube of Gaia is?|
53962|What's the Cube of Gaia?|
53963|#823$#Thanks to the Cube of Gaia, I am able to use my power here on Terra.
#821$#It must be fate that this mysterious power has brought me to you. Yes.|
53964|#824$#Even if I cannot find out the origin of that mysterious power...
#822$#Where do we come from and why are we even here? I don't have a single clue about this. Do you know anything about it?|
53965|#821$#Oh? If you know anything, could you tell me?
#824$#No matter how much knowledge I have acquired, there are bound to be many things in this world that I don't know. Yes.|
53966|#821$#Since we're talking about the Cube of Gaia, I remember having had a fight against Typhon a long time ago.
#824$#I caught a glimpse of what seemed to be something like the Energized Crystal from the Cube of Gaia within his body... Very interesting... Yes.|
53971|What can we do to help people in need?|
53972|To help the people in need...|
53973|#821$#I've heard there's an organization called the Mirabelle Association...
#822$#The group gathers requests from people in need all over the world.
#823$#I'm also very interested in that. Yes.|
53974|#822$#You are a kind soul! Me too! I knew it!
#821$#Though helping people in need is important, don't forget to take good care of yourself.|
53975|#822$#I didn't know that you could be so kind and generous... Isn't that what is called "going the extra mile"?
#824$#Or... you are just doing it for the benefits? Ah! Don't tell me I've always been wrong about you!|
53976|#821$#I will help you if you are in a tight spot!
#822$#Provided that the sun shines there! Hahaha! Yes, yes. Just kidding. Yes.|
53981|Do you have your own Guardian Knight?|
53982|Do you know of the Guardian Knights?|
53983|#821$#Aren't... YOU... my Guardian Knight...?|
53984|#821$#Guardian Knights... Don't tell me that you do not have one?
#823$#In this case, I am willing to be your very own knight... Yes.|
53985|#821$#Guardian Knights... A very interesting system, truly.
#823$#I heard that once you have established a protective relationship with someone, there will be tasks that require both of you to complete...
#822$#But this is just hearsay. I think it would be good for you to try it out!|
53986|#821$#There's something I've always been curious about... don't the knights have something to ride?
#822$#Don't tell me that the Guardian Knights ride on one of the guardian soldiers... Haha, just kidding! Yes.|
53991|What are the benefits of joining a guild?|
53992|Tell me some tips about guilds.|
53993|#821$#I heard that humans will join this type of organization and lead a life of helping one another.
#823$#If you think you are lonely or need help, join a guild!|
53994|#821$#I don't quite understand why the humans gather there...
#822$#Maybe it is a good place to make friends? Do you lack friends?|
53995|#821$#All guilds will have their own territory, where the merchants come and settle from all over the world. Yes.
#824$#Sometimes I wish that other Eidolon would go there to visit and challenge the guilds... These Eidolon love to fight...|
53996|#822$#Are you saying you don't have your own guild? That's shocking...|
54001|What does Amaterasu usually do?|
54002|What does your job involve?|
54003|#821$#Illuminating the Land of Sun and spreading light, warmth and peace.
#824$#Hmm? Aelius and Bealdor are also... Why do you compare me to those children?|
54004|#821$#Protecting people in need, that is my job.|
54005|#821$#What about you? What's your job? What do you usually do?
#822$#Haha! I am very interested in your questions... Yes.|
54006|#821$#Humans tend to see things in a similar way. What do you think?|
54011|The story about three cultural relics.|
54012|Could you tell me about the cultural relics?|
54013|#823$#You're asking this question, and that means you must have known about these things! Guess what the three cultural relics are.|
54014|#821$#Hmm... One of them is Kusanagi! Just speaking about this makes me miss her again...
#824$#Ah! Never tell her what I said! Otherwise I'll be angry! Yes. Otherwise I'll be angry! Yes.|
54015|#821$#Kusanagi, the Sacred Mirror, Yasakani no Magatama... These are the three cultural relics...
#822$#Haha! I've always brought them but never checked the numbers. I'm so clumsy!|
54016|#821$#Hmm. Instead of talking about my cultural relics, let's talk about your weapons!
#822$#You're very skilled in handling weapons... Have you been practicing since you were young?|
54021|learn to imitate how other Eidolon speak!|
54022|Could you imitate other Eidolon?|
54023|#821$#Aelius is nothing but a despicable, shameless... I don't want to meet him!
#823$#Haha! I have some experience in imitating that lunar hare!
#822$#Hmm? Serena isn't who you think... Hahaha! Really?|
54024|#823$#I have had this power ever since I was born. The power is above all living creatures.
#822$#Haha... the snake has lots of self-confidence, but when it comes to acquiring power, there can be no doubts.
#821$#If you say so... but I think that the snake has to submit itself to Helonia before I do. Yes.|
54025|#824$#Me? Why imitate me? What is it that you do not understand about me?|
54026|#824$#You... Are you joking? I'm not just some three-year old kid! Yes.|
54031|Your relationship with Kusanagi?|
54032|How are you related to Kusanagi?|
54033|#823$#Haha! You actually know about me... Scary!
#821$#Kusanagi and I have known each other for a long time... Even before that girl was born.
#823$#This story might go on for days.|
54034|#824$#Kusanagi? The girl used to be evil! Yes.
#821$#Inheriting Yamato no Orochi's evil character, knowing only of violence...|
54035|#821$#Haha! Kusanagi isn't just my sword,
#823$#she's also the child that I'm most proud of! Yes.|
54036|#821$#Do you know?!
#822$#What do you think of Kusanagi? Cute? Charming? Humorous? But... It doesn't matter how much you like her,
#824$#You will never be allowed to marry Kusanagi! NEVER!|
54041|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
54042|Tell me something interesting about other Eidolons.|
54043|#822$#Want to know the secret behind the Divine Flame Angel's wings? Haha! I'd never have imagined that you gossip so much...
#821$#I've heard that the wings were originally white, but they changed color for some reason...
#824$#Hmm? The relationship with Bealdor and Alucard? I think you're a bit odd... Yes.|
54044|#823$#Hansel is a boy that loves his younger sister, and behaves like an older brother!
#821$#But I don't get along well with Tsukuyomi... Don't you have siblings too?|
54045|#821$#Diao Chan comes from the magical east, Vermilion comes from the southern sky, while Shirayuki comes from the cold north...
#822$#Hmm. I am starting to get a bit curious... There must be some mysterious place to the west. Yes.|
54046|#824$#Kaiser Zeta... That child is still so rash.
#821$#If you have time, you should remind him! If he loses something again... There's nothing I can say about it... Yes.|
54051|Your catchphrase...|
54052|Yes. Yes. Yes.|
54053|#824$#Ah! That's too much! How dare you poke fun of me!
#821$#That's something I picked up a long time ago, I can't just change it...
#823$#That's why... Yes! Don't make fun of me! Yes!|
54054|#824$#Do you have problem with my way of speaking?!
#821$#It's not that I'm soft-tempered. Yes. I shall forgive you this time round,
#824$#but if you do it again, I'll make sure you regret it!|
54055|#821$#What?! You actually discovered my catchphrase...
#821$#Don't try to spread it around or make fun of it! If Kusanagi knows that still can't get away with my catchphrase,
#821$#she will laugh at me!|
54056|#822$#Hahaha! I don't quite understand it, but what is it? Y... you!
#824$#Oh... no! You can't make fun of Amaterasu, or I'll be angry!|
54061|Who's Tsukuyomi?|
54062|Do you have an older brother?|
54063|#821$#Let me think... Are you referring to that rude, violent, unreasonable, no-sense-of-courtesy-having Tsukuyomi?
#824$#Don't talk to me about him! I'll never accept an older brother like that!|
54064|#821$#If I represent the Land of Sun, then Tsukuyomi is the Land of Moon,
#822$#but I really don't think Tuskuyomi takes good care of that Land of the "Midnight Snacks"... Har, har, har...|
54065|#821$# Planning on replacing me already? Just tell me who it is! Who's better than me?|
54066|#821$#Tsukuyomi... Tsukuyomi... Yes, I do know him. We used to be as one before I was born.
#824$#How are you related to him?|
54071|Do you know Aelius?|
54072|Do you know Bealdor?|
54073|#821$#Hmm. It's not that you shouldn't ask this question,
#822$#but he and I are not on the same leve. Hahaha!|
54074|#821$#Aelius the Knight of the Sun and Bealdor the Bringer of Light? That's interesting!
#823$#Before I came here, I never noticed if there were any other rays of light in the sky!|
54075|#823$#Of course I know... He's a good child!|
54076|#821$#Hmm. Why would you think that I wouldn't know this?|
54081|You have a very special weapon.|
54082|I've never seen anything like it before.|
54083|#821$#Interested in my Sacred Mirror? You have quite a good eye. Yes.
#822$#I wish I could lend it to you, but the mirror will revert to its original size once it's out of my reach,
#823$#and that could destroy Navea in an instant! Yes.|
54084|#823$#My Sacred Mirror can illuminate things! The lights can illuminate the entirety of Midgard. Yes.|
54085|#821$#The Sacred Mirror can show the ugly side of humanity. Do you want to try it too?
#822$#Eh? What's that? No? Haha! Are you guilty of something?|
54086|#821$#The Sacred Mirror contains another world. Yes.
#822$#What you see in the mirror world will be the direct opposite of our reality. For instance, your alter ego in the mirror world...
#824$#Would they be someone who is bent on destruction?|
54091|Have you thought about what your life will be like after we part ways?|
54092|What would you do if we had to say goodbye?|
54093|#821$#Even if I am not by your side, the rays of Helonia will bless you.|
54094|#821$#I haven't thought much about it... Unless you've had enough of me.
#824$#I can't pretend that I didn't hear that. Yes.|
54095|#821$#I don't think you will give up on this place so easily. Are you a weakling?
#823$#Besides me, you have me as reinforcement!|
54096|#821$#I believe that I can make my own decisions, so you will not leave this place in this shape.
#823$#I can see the world, hope, and future in your eyes.|
54201|What is justice?|
54202|Tell me about what justice means to you.|
54203|#821$#Justice... is simply defeating all evil people enough?
#822$#Heehee! But then... how do you differentiate good and evil people?
#824$#Um... A real mind teaser, eh?|
54204|#822$#Haha! But our little Alice is a hero. Don't you know, you are the bringer of justice!
#821$#Me? I am justice? Am I the incarnation of justice?!|
54205|#821$#Justice! It's doing whatever you think is right, isn't it?
#822$#Heehee! There's no simple answer...
#823$#Why, what do you think? Is Alice right to say that?|
54206|#821$#Justice... what is it, actually? Defeating bad guys, I guess?
#824$#But how do we know who the bad guys are?|
54211|Do you like animals?|
54212|What's your favorite animal?|
54213|#821$#Rabbits, cats, mice, oh and also Ches!
#822$#Haha! Meow! Do I count as a cat?|
54214|#824$#Don't you know that Master does not like animals? Does Ches not like them either?
#822$#People really break my heart...|
54215|#821$#Oh, in that case... What about soldiers, do you consider them as animals?
#822$#Ha! Soldiers? Filthy, disgusting swine...
#824$#I much prefer the company of animals.|
54216|#821$#Ches is the world's cutest cat!
#822$#Heehee! Someone said I look evil! That's meant as a compliment, right?|
54221|What do you usually do during holidays?|
54222|What do you do in your spare time?|
54223|#823$#Sometimes I like to go for a nice picnic with Hansel and Gretel... Gretel always brings along lots of sweet pastries, like gingerbread!
#822$#Hahaha! Hansel, on the other hand, never contributes anything...
#821$#He's always leaving trails of food made of whatever he planned to bring! Hansel's contribution is, he eats all the food Gretel brings.
#824$#That's not what I'd call a contribution...|
54224|#821$#I will... host a tea party for all of you! With snacks and drinks...
#822$#Heehee! And we can discuss relationships and love!|
54225|#823$#Did someone say food? Will there be a tea party today?
#822$#I can't wait! Alice has quite an appetite!
#824$#Hey, shut your mouth! Don't spout nonsense, Ches! I didn't!|
54226|#825$#It's the plain truth! I'm just thinking about cats.
#822$#So fuzzy! I'm thinking about how I can get stronger by practicing with you!|
54231|How should I take on powerful enemies?|
54232|The strategy when facing a powerful enemy.|
54233|#821$#Is there anyone Master can't defeat? Ches is looking at you... hohoho!
#822$#Heehee! I've always thought that Master must be invincible!|
54234|#821$#Huh? Oh yes... what can be done?
#822$#Heehee! While Alice was busy thinking, Master must have already dealt with the enemy!
#823$#Wow! Master is so powerful!|
54235|#821$#As long as Ches and I stick with Master, there's no enemy that would beat us!
#822$#Heehee! You are saying that as if there was ever a chance of betrayal...
#824$#That's... That's not true! Stoppit, Ches!|
54236|#821$#Get ready, now give the power to Ches!
#823$But... Master should have better weapons! Have some self-confidence, and you can do it!|
54241|Is there anyone you adore?|
54242|Who are your idols?|
54243|#821$#Well, Amaterasu is always bright and shining... with a shimmering, goddess-like air...
#822$#Heehee! She looks the same age as Alice, but with so much more class!
#821$#Yes! I will continue to strive!|
54244|#821$#Sister Astraea is so powerful and beautiful... She's my idol!
#822$#Hooyah! Will Alice ever become classy like her?
#821$#Um... Uh, about that... No, I don't think so...|
54245|#822$#Hoooey! My idol is the Master of the Southern Star!
#821$#Because the Master of the Southern Star is very strong? Well, I feel that Ches is very strong too!
#822$#Hawhawhaw! I mean, someone with short arms and legs could actually teach Vermilion some martial arts... That's amazing!|
54246|#823$#I saw Brother Uriel practicing before. He's so handsome!
#821$#But... What kinda angel has black wings? Shouldn't they be white?
#823$#Yes, but black suits Brother Uriel. Alice wants a pair of wings too.|
54251|Do you know about the holy sword incident?|
54252|Tell me about the holy sword...|
54253|#821$#Holy sword.. What is it? Never heard of it!
#822$#Hurrhurr! There seems to be no such item in Wonderland. No wonder Alice doesn't know it!
#823$#Hoohoo! Is it some treasure from Terra?|
54254|#821$#Is it a weapon? Who's stronger, you or Ches?
#822$#Hardy har har! Apples and oranges, my friend. Apples and oranges. How to compare? It can't be done!
#821$#You're just afraid to lose, aren't you?|
54255|#823$#Um... we need a neutral judge. Maybe Hansel? Let's go, Ches. Let's go and ask Hansel!
#822$#Hurphurp! Do you really love this little wolf?
#824$#That's... That's not true!... I don't want to talk about it...|
54256|#823$#I heard that from Brother Bealdor! It is a sword in Terra that contains the Power of Gaia...
#822$#Heehee! Some say that the sword was created by the Cube of Gaia.
#821$#Then what is Brother Bealdor's sword made of?|
54261|Tell me about Principia.|
54262|What's Principia like?|
54263|#821$#What's that?
#822$#Heehohooha! Principia? Well, all's I know is, if you want to get there, you'll need to take an airship.
#823$#Wow! Take me with you! Please... I want to come!|
54264|#821$#Alice heard about that before! Apparently there is an emerald sea...
#822$#Heh heh! Alice is talking about the Viridian Steppe! That's not even a real sea.
#824$#Huh? It isn't?|
54265|#821$#Principia? Is that a medical condition? I don't know what you're talking about.
#822$#Heehee! Alice is racking her brain again...|
54266|#821$#I think Hansel mentioned that once... But I'd hardly call myself an expert on the subject.|
54271|What is the Viridian Steppe like?|
54272|Could you tell me about the Viridian Steppe?|
54273|#821$#Viridian... Steppe? Where is that?
#822$#Hurdelly gurdelly! Alice can't recall anything! I think it's somewhere out in the continent of Principia.
#823$# Oh, oh! That's right! I just remembered!|
54274|#822$#Teehee! It's a grassland located on the western continent!
#823$#Wow... Ches is smart! I thought it was a sea...|
54275|#821$#I heard that there's a special race that lives there... They look like Brother Cyril...
#822$#Haha! You mean the centaur race. They are experts in astrology!
#823$#That's cool... Alice wants to make friends with the centaurs!|
54276|#824$#Er, geography's not really my strong point. Next question!|
54281|Could you tell me about the holy chest?|
54282|What is the holy chest?|
54283|#821$#Is it, like, a big wardrobe? Can I put clothes in it?
#822$#Heehee! No, you can't! It's where you can upgrade your weapons!
#823$#Then I can put Ches in the chest!|
54284|#821$#Yes, I know. It's a magical chest, and you can only put golden weapons into it!
#822$#Oh yeah? What happens after something is put in?
#821$#Hmm... Good question... I don't know, should I ask Hansel again?|
54285|#822$#Hahaha! Alice can't to use this thing!
#821$#Huh? Why? I want to try it out too...
#822$#Haha, oh you! Only selected Envoys of Gaia can use it!
#825$#Hmm... Just you wait, I'll get the best item!|
54286|#821$#Whoa. You can put in gold-quality weapons and enhance them!
#823$#I'm not too sure how it works. But it seems to hold a strange power!
#822$#Heehee! Master will have to fight on to become stronger!|
54291|Do you know anything about archaeology?|
54292|Could you tell me anything about it?|
54293|#823$#Does Master want to go excavate artifacts? Alice wants to do that too!
#822$#Haha! Alice is so clumsy, she would destroy all the artifacts...
#824$#Hmm. My strength... it's just so hard to control...|
54294|#821$#I heard that archaeologists discovered the remains of the first ever mount ever ridden.
#822$#Amazing! Does Alice really know what archaeology entails?
#823$#Good question! What does it entail? Does Ches know? Does Master?|
54295|#821$#Archaeology... well, first, you have to have a plan!
#823$# And then... you dig! Dig, dig, dig! That's pretty much it. That's archaeology! You dig?
#822$#Haha! Alice doesn't know at all...|
54296|#821$#I heard recently about some people who formed an exploration team...
#824$#But Alice isn't very sure about the details... Sorry...|
54301|Why did you come to Terra?|
54302|Why did you want to be with me?|
54303|#825$#Because of Master's handsome Fa-- hey! Ouch! Who hit me?
#822$#Heehee! What Alice meant is that it's because she likes Master's personality.
#825$#Ah? But what was Ches saying just before?|
54304|#821$#Ches told me about all the monsters in Terra, which do not exist in Wonderland...
#823$#So I came here to practice my combat skills!
#822$#Heehee! That's right... It has nothing to do with you, Master.|
54305|#821$#Ches said the Power of Gaia was strong within you. That's why I'm here!
#825$#Huh? Why do you ask? Of course I'm here for that. Hohoho!
#822$#Heehee! Master's power is also well-known in Wonderland!|
54306|#821$#Erm... Ches says the Hearts could come back at any time.
#823$#I must be strong enough to face them!
#822$#Heehee! If Master could help us, that would be good...|
54311|I've heard you come from Wonderland.|
54312|Do you come from Wonderland?|
54313|#821$#Hoohoo! Alice is the real hero of Wonderland!
#822$#Heehee! That Hearts woman really did a number on the place... And we don't know when she'll be back!
#821$#Haha! Yes... I have to be stronger, so she doesn't come back and bully Ches!|
54314|#822$#Heehee! Some people don't believe in Wonderland. They say it's fake... But I assure you, it's not!
#821$#That's right! Endora wants to visit Wonderland on her journey through the dreamlands...
#823$#Grandpa Alucard said it best: "Realer than a dream, stranger than reality."
#822$#Heehee! He's pretty deep...|
54315|#822$#Hahaha! We all come from this magical land!
#821$#It's amazing... so magical! If you have time, you can come and visit!|
54316|#822$#Heehee! Don't think that just because Alice is petite, she can't be the hero of Wonderland!
#821$#Hoohoo! No... If there was no Ches, I'd have no idea how to get by!|
54321|Who is the Queen of Hearts?|
54322|The Queen of Hearts?|
54323|#821$#She's a bad, naughty, evil queen! Before Alice...
#822$#Heehee! The old queen of Wonderland... She's a cruel person...
#821$#But Ches is not afraid! If we have Master fighting with us when she returns, there's no way we can lose!|
54324|#821$#Ahem! Master should really know this! The Queen of Hearts is... Um...
#822$#Heehee! She's the former queen of Wonderland... She's a cruel one...|
54325|#821$#The queen of Wonderland! Until she lost her crown, that is!
#822$#Heehee! I don't know whether she'll return...|
54326|#822$#Heehohooha! I really don't wish to recall the incident...
#821$#Ches... Master is just asking out of curiosity!|
54331|Please introduce yourself.|
54332|Could you introduce yourself?|
54333|#821$#I am... Alice!
#822$#Heehee! I'm the Cheshire Cat, Alice's favorite pet!|
54334|#821$#I come from Wonderland! Alice is the name.
#823$#This is Ches. He's my best friend, as well as my cannon...
#821$#So, now's it's Master's turn! Master, please introduce yourself too!|
54335|#821$#Doesn't Master already know?
#824$#Don't tell me... You thought Alice was Endora? How sad...
#822$#Heehee! Is it her pretty golden hair? Who can say...|
54336|#821$#I am... Alice the Tea Queen. The Baroness of Brew.
#823$#Hoohoo! Do I look like Grandpa Alucard?
#822$#Heehee! Not in the slightest! What's a Tea Queen, anyway? Like Earl Grey?|
54341|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolon?|
54342|Any juicy Eidolon Gossip?|
54343|#822$#Heehee! Alice is secretly in love with Hansel!
#824$#No way! I don't tell lies! We're just friends...
#822$#Heehee! And Alice doesn't even know!|
54344|#821$#Brother Ghodroon's lava... It turns to gold when it drips!
#822$#Heehee! That'll probably entice you humans... You humans sure do love money.
#823$#Money is power, right? Hmm, now I want some of that lava too! I need more power!|
54345|#821$#Sister Astraea is always talking about Aelius, Serena, and Cesela.
#823$#And Hansel never shuts up about Gretel... Even ol' Granny Amaterasu is always nattering on about Sister Kusanagi!
#821$#But Alice... Apart from Ches, there's no one else who talks to Master...|
54346|#824$#Ol' Gramps Alucard rarely gets angry, but this one time, he was quarreling with Sister Diao Chan!
#821$#Probably it was because Diao Chan is always spreading rumors about him...
#823$#Hoohoo! Luckily, Alice is obedient, so I never make anyone angry!
#822$#Heehee! Alucard does not seem to like angels...|
54351|Tell me about your weapon.|
54352|What kinda cannon is that?|
54353|#821$# It's Ches! Ches is always like this - he lends me the power I need.
#823$#and he's verrrrry capable!
#822$#Heehee! But I still sometimes need to ask Alice to be a bit gentler...|
54354|#821$#A cannon can help control attack power!
#823$#That's what Ches says to me, anyway...Woohoo!|
54355|#823$#Heehee! Talking about me, are you? A cannon with high-powered cartridge output and a large caliber...
#822$#Ha! You must be envious! But you should know, only Alice can use this power!|
54356|#821$#What's Ches' full name?
#822$#Heehee! It's Chester!
#823$#Right! Ches's super destructive cannon!|
54361|Who are all these people at the tea party?|
54362|Who are the tea party invites?|
54363|#821$#Ches and I... plus various rabbits, cats and mice are coming too!
#823$#If Master is interested... You could also join us at the tea party!|
54364|#821$#Look, here are the tea party invites! If you are interested, you can also be an invitee!
#822$#Heehee! Most of the snacks were made by Gretel!
#821$#Hoohoo! Gretel's snacks are delish!|
54365|#821$#Yum yum! Perhaps Master could join us too!
#823$#I'm also thinking of inviting Hansel... He's probably too busy to make it, of course...
#822$#Heehee! Alice forgot about Gretel, as usual.|
54366|#821$#Oh yes... Lots of people... But who are they all...
#822$#Heehee! Alice isn't very attentive when it comes to taking attendance!
#824$#That's... That's not true... Just takes me a while to think...|
54371|Did you already know the Gruesome Twosome?|
54372|Are Hansel and Gretel your friends?|
54373|#821$#Alice has already known them for a very long time...
#822$#Heehee! I heard that they even knew each other before coming to Wonderland...
#823$#Hoho! We are best friends!|
54374|#821$#Of course, we are friends...
#824$#Master... Don't you have any friends?|
54375|#821$#I've known them for a long time, but I can't recall when we first met.
#824$#I can't remember... I think it was even before I met Ches.|
54376|#823$#Hohoho! Does Master know them too?|
54381|Tell me, what in your life needs to be protected?|
54382|What are the reasons you always strive to become stronger?|
54383|#821$#Alice has someone whom she needs to protect!
#822$#Heehee! Is it Hansel, that little wolf?
#824$#Shut your mouth! Stop spreading lies. Don't spout nonsense, Ches!|
54384|#821$#If I don't become stronger... I'll probably lose control of this loon, Ches, for starters.
#822$#Heehee! Oh, you...
#821$#History shall repeat itself!|
54385|#821$#Does Master have someone to protect too?
#823$#Grandpa Alucard once told Alice that one has to become stronger in order to protect others!
#821$#Apparently Grandpa Alucard is a great protector...
#822$#Heehee! Alice's always has a different perspective on things than us normal folks...|
54386|#821$#If we were as big and tough as Master, so strong and brave, then we could protect everyone!|
54391|Have you thought about how your life will be after we've parted ways?|
54392|What's your plan for the future?|
54393|#821$#Part ways? What, after Master uses the Power of Gaia?
#822$#Heehee! But we'll never leave Master! We're coming with you, Master!|
54394|#821$#I've never thought about it once! What are you talking about? Why would you ask me a question like that? Don't you like me?
#824$#Hmph. In that case, I don't like you either. Leave me alone!
#822$#Heehee! Master really likes to spout nonsense!|
54395|#821$#Huh? Must Master always bring along Alice wherever Master goes?
#822$#Heehee! If there are things that you can't tell me, I understand.
#823$# Blink once if there are things you can't tell me? Wow, so there actually are things that you can't tell me!|
54396|#821$#Don't you worry, Master! Ches and I will always be with you...|
54501|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
54502|What do you do to kill time?|
54503|#821$# Well, I practice my fighting skills a lot.
#822$# Me 'n Ruffles here always need to be ready for battle!|
54504|#821$# Sometimes I go shopping with Diao Chan...
#822$# But that can be tough. Diao Chan doesn't have very good taste... I can't go out in the stuff she picks out!
#824$#I'd be way too embarrassed! So I usually just stay home and play sudoku or something.|
54505|#822$#Well, normally I just keep watch on you to make sure everything's going okay.
#824$# Yes, even while you're sleeping! No, that's not creepy! That's when you're the most vulnerable! I am just worried about your safety!|
54506|#821$# Free time? What a novel concept! That would be great if you gave me a break now and again.|
54511|What do you do to prepare for battle?|
54512|Do you have any training tips?|
54513|#821$# I live for battles. Obviously, protecting you is my first priority,
#823$# but that doesn't mean the thrill of smashing a few heads together doesn't get my heart pumping!|
54514|#821$# Of course, I had to train a lot to get to my level of fitness and combat skill.
#823$# I don't know if there's much you can learn from me. You're already at quite a high level yourself!|
54515|#821$#I don't know if I should give away my secrets. What if you use them against me?
#823$#You never know, one day we may be enemies! And if that happens, you can bet I'm gonna have to school you!|
54516|#823$#Ruffles has had plenty of training too! You don't wanna get hit with the power of the Ruffles!|
54521|Have you ever been in love?|
54522|Have you ever had a boyfriend?|
54523|#825$# Eh? Uh, what kind of question is that? Let's try to keep things professional, shall we?
#821$# I don't need a boyfriend! I've got you! And we're going to stay together forever! I just know it!|
54524|#821$# No... I've always been saving myself for someone who could beat me in battle.
#824$#Til I find one, I won't accept any suitors. But I'll admit, it's not easy. Nobody is at my level.|
54525|#824$# Love? That's not really my thing.|
54526|#823$# I just like battling and spending time with you and Ruffles.|
54531|Do you like animals?|
54532|What's your favorite animal?|
54533|#821$# Well, that's an easy one. My little Ruffles!|
54534|#822$# Do you like eagles? They are so regal. They fly, they fight, they're strong and fast and they're beautiful.
#821$#I love them, but Ruffles is scared of them. What a little scaredy-fluff!|
54535|#821$# I have respect for any animal that can hunt and fight.|
54536|#823$# I love any animal that flies. They look so majestic, soaring in the air.|
54541|Is there anyone that you have a crush on?|
54542|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
54543|#821$# Why do you ask?
#822$#Are you interested in someone? Do you need a wingman? Who is it? Tell me!|
54544|#821$# Well there is someone... I think she is very beautiful...
#825$# But it's not a crush! Their name? Um... Never mind, I don't want to tell you.|
54545|#821$# No, there isn't. And quite frankly, it's none of your business! Now leave me alone!
#822$# I said GOOD DAY, sir.|
54546|#823$# I don't need a crush, I've got Ruffles!
#825$# Ruffles 'n me, we make a great team. Oh, and you too, I guess... But mostly me and Ruffles.|
54551|What's a Quest?|
54552|Can you give me any information on Quests?|
54553|#821$# A quest is like a mission.
#822$# My mission is to help you as much as I can!|
54554|#822$# Your mission is to do Quests!
#821$# You don't have to accept every quest you're offered. But you can get some pretty neat rewards out of them!|
54555|#821$#What, you have a request for me? But I'm not a DJ!
#822$# Oh, I see! That kind of request. Sorry, I misunderstood. No, I will definitely complete your request, just tell me!|
54556|#821$# Quests are a great way to get rewards. Sometimes you can get money. Other times it's items you'll win!
#822$# But the most precious rewards are the unique experiences you'll have. The new friends, the memories... Just kidding, it's definitely the money. Let's go make us some money!|
54561|Do you know anything about Shuriken?|
54562|I'm curious about Shuriken. Do you know how to use them?|
54563|#821$# Shurik-what now? Nope, sorry, can't help you.
#822$#I don't really go in for that kinda ninja stuff.|
54564|#822$# Yeah... Shuriken. Not really "sure-I-can" help you there, pal. Do you get it? Huh, do ya? Good pun, right?
#823$#Anyways, sorry, but no. But if you ever need any archery tips I'll be glad to help out.|
54565|#821$# All those Ninjutsu and special ninja throwing type weapons are super cool.
#823$# But in terms of pure efficacy, I still think bow and arrow are better.|
54566|#821$# Are you interested in mastering them? I think Tsubaki would probably know more...
#822$#Want me to check?|
54571|Can you tell me about profession levels?|
54572|What's the deal with these professions?|
54573|#821$# Do you like fishing? I find it relaxing from time to time, though I'm no expert.|
54574|#821$# I don't think I'm the right person to answer this question. My talents are archery and animal training...|
54575|#821$# My only advice for you is, practice makes perfect.
#822$# That goes for everything, from fishing, archaeology, cooking, or even other activities.
#823$# The more you practice, the more upgrades you'll get. Level up and you'll see better results before you know it!|
54576|#824$# Sorry, that's not really my wheelhouse. Next question!|
54581|Can you tell me about Housing?|
54582|What is the Housing System?|
54583|#821$# Exactly what it sounds like! You get a house! You can decorate it however you like! It's swell.
#821$# I hope you'll invite me over! I promise I'm house trained!|
54584|#821$# A house is a space where you can decorate, a personal space that belongs to you and you alone.
#823$# You can invite your friends over and have tea together.|
54585|#821$#I'd love to come visit,
#824$#but I'll probably make a huge mess. 
#822$#Maybe I can help decorate...|
54586|#822$# I think you should devote the outside to an archery range, that would be perfect...
#821$# What do you think?|
54591|What is the Envoy's Path?|
54592|What can you tell me about the Envoy's Path?|
54593|#821$# It's important to choose your Envoy's Path wisely according to your needs!
#822$# If you ask me, I would choose skills that increase your attacking prowess.
#823$#Attack is the best defense! Ain't that right, Ruffles?|
54594|#821$#The Envoy's Path is where you can make good use of all that XP you've collected, and increase your abilities so you can get even more XP! 
#822$#Most of the skills are for increasing your battle skills, but I have heard that 
#823$#some of them might give you a little boost in your chances of getting treasure.|
54595|#821$# Envoy's Path? Yeah, you can use it to level up your skills!
#822$# But you need to choose which ones you want. |
54596|#824$#Don't ask me to choose for you. Just choose yourself! |
54601|How'd you pick a name for your lil' pet there?|
54602|How did you come up with your eagle's name?|
54603|#821$# Who? Oh, you mean Ruffles? 
#823$# I mean, just look at him. His feathers! |
54604|#822$# You don't like the name?
#825$# I think it's really cute! Ruffles is a cute name, he's a cute lil' guy! What's wrong with the name?|
54605|#822$# Do you have a better suggestion?
#824$#No? I thought not. Cause Ruffles is the best. |
54606|#825$# What? You got something to say about my bird's name? Say it to his face! That's right. I thought not. |
54611|Wow, you're an amazing archer!|
54612|I'm so impressed with your archery skills! And that bow is magnificent...|
54613|#821$# You like it? It's a gift from the gods. 
#823$#That's why I have such good aim. It's got special powers!|
54614|#821$#Plus all the training I do also helps a lot. That's why I'm the best archer around!|
54615|#821$#When it comes to archery, I'm the best in the land! No one can touch me. 
#822$#You? Haha. You probably couldn't even pull back the bowstring! |
54616|#821$# Do you have any good ideas for a name for my bow? I had a few ideas, but 
#825$# since you didn't like Ruffles, I figured I should ask your opinion. What about "Tae Bow"? Or "Bow-Tie"?|
54621|So, how are the other Eidolons getting along these days?|
54622|Any new Eidolon gossip?|
54623|#821$# I don't really keep up with the other Eidolons. You and Ruffles are enough for me! |
54624|#824$#To be honest, I don't really like mingling with the other Eidolons too much.
#822$#Ayako's always trying to eat poor Ruffles.|
54625|#821$#I like spending time with Kusanagi, I can always learn something new from her. 
#822$# Her attack is so impressive. Maybe I could learn it if I practiced hard enough. |
54626|#822$#Serena has good style. 
#821$# But I could never pull off that look. 
#824$# Sp she'd never want to hang out with me. Oh well...|
54631|So is your name really Yumikaze?|
54632|That's an interesting name!|
54633|#823$# Thank you!|
54634|#821$# Actually, Yumikaze isn't my real name.
#822$# But... Everyone has been calling me that for so long that I've forgotten my real name.|
54635|#823$# What? You don't like my name?|
54636|#821$# I don't really like my name. I always wanted a more original name. Like Mumbleton. Or Palloolla.
#824$# Do you have a better idea? Oh, then I guess you can just call me Yumikaze.|
54641|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolons?|
54642|So... Any juicy Eidolon gossip?|
54643|#824$# What? Did no one ever tell you that it's not really very nice to spread gossip behind people's backs?|
54644|#821$# I don't really go in for gossip. But Eternia is always up with all the knowledge. You should ask her instead.
#824$# Personally, if you ask me, I think it's kind of rude to spread gossip. Why should I tell rumors around about my friends?|
54645|#822$# Diao Chan is a total babe.
#821$# But we aren't into the same things at all. Our tastes are completely different!|
54646|#821$# Is there anything specific you want to know? Just tell me what you want to know,
#822$#and I'll try to find out for you.|
54651|What a handsome eagle!|
54652|Is that your pet?|
54653|#824$# Ruffles is more than a pet, he's a friend!
#822$# Wait... What's that face? You didn't know he was called Ruffles? Cause of his feathers, get it? Ruffles!|
54654|#822$# Ruffles? He's been around for a long time.
#823$# He's a big help in battles!|
54655|#821$# Plus, he's pretty much my best friend too.|
54656|#821$# Isn't he handsome? Such nice plumage... I love to show him off to the other Eidolons.
#824$#Except Ayako! That glutton just wants to eat him. I can't ever leave her alone with him.|
54661|Where are you from?|
54662|Can you tell me about your hometown?|
54663|#821$# My hometown...?
#822$# I don't have a hometown anymore. That part of my life is over.|
54664|#821$# I don't like to talk about my past. You know that.|
54665|#821$# I'm here now. That's all you need to know.|
54666|#822$# Aww, are you thinking about home? Sounds like you're homesick. Maybe you should go home and leave the adventuring to a real hero!|
54671|Has anyone ever told you how beautiful you are?|
54672|Your sense of style and elan is really inspiring.|
54673|#823$# Why, thank you!|
54674|#825$# Go on... I love receiving compliments! It's so rare that anyone ever says anything nice to me. I need to cherish these rare moments.|
54675|#822$#Are you being sarcastic? That's so mean!
#824$# I understand that maybe my style isn't up to your high standards.
#821$# But that doesn't mean you should tease me!|
54676|#824$# Ahaha! I bet you say that to everyone, don't you?
#823$# Trying to butter me up, are you? That's okay. I like compliments anyway. Even if I know they're not real.|
54681|Are you good at anything else besides archery?|
54682|Do you know how to use other weapons?|
54683|#823$# Of course! I am good with all weapons. I just love archery. It's so graceful.
#823$# And I like using ranged attacks. That way I can stay far back and not mess up my hair.|
54684|#823$# Ruffles likes to attack from distance, too.
#823$# Plus, I have such a pretty bow, it would be a waste not to use it!|
54685|#823$# I used to use other weapons sometimes, likes knives.
#823$# But I always came back to my bow!|
54686|#823$# Whatever weapon I use, you can be sure I will use it to the best of my ability to protect you!|
54691|Have you thought about how your life will be after we've parted ways?|
54692|What's your plan for the future?|
54693|#824$# I'm not going anywhere. I will not leave before finishing my mission.|
54694|#821$# Future? I live in the present. Why plan now for what might happen in the future?|
54695|#821$# Why do you ask? Are you planning to leave me soon?
#824$# I guess I should start making plans too then?|
54696|#824$# Why are you asking? What did I do? Did I do something to upset you?
#822$# Tell me! Now I'm all nervous!|
54801|Your favorite leisure activity|
54802|Ways to kill time|
54803|#821$#I like to play with Nakama.
#821$#Did you know! Nakama is super-soft!
#821$#I love to pinch him on the nose and watch him make cute little faces!|
54804|#821$#Sleep with Nakama?
#822$#Well, now that you mention it, I am feeling a little sleepy...
#822$#Why not jump up here on Nakama's back and doze off with me?|
54805|#821$#What do you want to know?
#822$#Maybe something about switching off Nakama's music, or taking his earphones?
#823$#Pretty awesome, right!|
54806|#821$#I'm a real bookworm. You can learn so much from books.
#821$#Learn what? Well, for instance, did you know it's impossible to lick your own elbow with your tongue? Does Master?|
54811|What's your favorite food?|
54812|What do I normally eat?|
54813|#821$#I have a real sweet tooth.
#822$#Did you know that?|
54814|#821$#I'm also a bit of a carnivore...
#821$#I love fresh fish and offal!
#821$#I wonder what your internal organs would taste like? Just kidding!|
54815|#821$#Actually, I don't eat that often...
#824$#Why not? That's a secret!|
54816|#821$#Nakama loves really spicy food.
#822$#Huh? What does Nakama eat? You want to feed Nakama?
#824$#Master, you're really too much...|
54821|What are friends?|
54822|What does friendship mean to you?|
54823|#824$#What are friends? I don't really understand the question...
#821$#Well, my best friend is Nakama.|
54824|#821$#Friends? Who needs 'em?
#822$#All I need is you and Nakama. I don't need anyone else!|
54825|#821$#I guess, someone who's close to me? Is that what you mean?
#822$#Nakama's the best friend in the world! Nakama and I are two of a kind!|
54826|#823$#Like two peas in a pod.
#821$#Do you have a friend like Nakama too?|
54831|What's your favorite type of music?|
54832|What kind of music do you listen to?|
54833|#823$#I love Nakama's music!
#823$#Come, check it out!|
54834|#821$#Nakama is really into rap music...
#824$#The first time I heard this song, I couldn't get it of my head...
#824$#I couldn't sleep a wink that night. It's a total earworm!|
54835|#821$#What about you?
#821$#I'm sure we have the same taste in music!|
54836|#821$#I love listening to Aelius's music.
#823$#It just makes you want to get up and dance, don't you think?|
54841|What do you think about art?|
54842|Tell me about aesthetics|
54843|#821$#What is art?
#824$#That's a tough one! Are you trying to put me on the spot?
#822$#Art is just dots and lines joined together!|
54844|#821$#You mean pretty things, right?
#823$#I love things that sparkle.|
54845|#822$#Art? All unique and wonderful objects count as art, don't they?
#823$#Like Nakama!|
54846|#824$#I'm just a theorist. I don't understand aesthetics!|
54851|Do you know anything about Shuriken?|
54852|Tell me about Shuriken.|
54853|#823$#I hear a shuriken in flight is really something to behold!
#822$#They making a loud whooping sound, right?|
54854|#824$#I know! It's a kind of weapon!
#821$#Do you want to learn how to use them?
#823$#I can lend Nakama to you, that way we can all learn together.|
54855|#821$#As I recall, a handsome Shadow Warrior will appear.
#824$#But he looks different each time I see him. Or do my eyes need testing?|
54856|#823$#It's from the East. A type of throwing weapon with a unique shape.
#822$#We should have a contest to see who's the best.
#823$#Want to learn? When you have some skill, we can have a little contest.|
54861|Do you know what the Cube of Gaia is?|
54862|What's the Cube of Gaia?|
54863|#821$#Cube of Gaia? Oh, yeah! I've heard of it.
#823$#The force of the Cube of Gaia is what guided me here to you.|
54864|#824$#But I don't know how...
#822$#Do you know? I'd really love to know.|
54865|#821$#The entire world you live in was created by the Cube of Gaia.
#824$#But where it came from, that I don't know.
#823$#But I do know, if it wasn't for that cube, we would never have met.|
54866|#821$#I think...
#822$#it's like Nakama's cloak, but with a few key differences...
#824$#Know what I mean?|
54871|Do you have your own Guardian Knight?|
54872|Do you know of the Guardian Knights?|
54873|#822$#Guardian Knights? Are they the people that guard Nakama and me?
#823$#That's you, isn't it Master? You're our Guardian Knight, right?|
54874|#821$#You can have a closer relationship with a partner you can really trust!
#823$#Now that I think of it, that's just like our relationship!
#822$#Huh? Because we really like you, we have undying faith that you'll protect us.|
54875|#824$#My Knight...
#822$#You must mean Nakama! He's the best partner I could ever wish for!|
54876|#821$#Guardian Knights?
#824$#Yeah, of course I know! It's...
#823$#It's when two people wear each other's rings, right? Am I right?|
54881|What is Eidolon purification?|
54882|I heard something about Eidolon purification. Do you know what it is?|
54883|#821$#It's a system that allows us to change our abilities.
#824$#Do you want to change us, Master?|
54884|#822$#Why you would want to purify me?
#824$#If you really do want to give me a new ability, I guess I'll cooperate...|
54885|#821$#But purification... it can be unstable.
#822$#Why is it unstable? Because it's a force that leaves so much to chance.|
54886|#824$#Are you displeased with me Master? I feel sad...
#823$#Heehee, did I scare you?
#822$#Don't be angry, I was only pulling your leg.|
54891|Can you tell me about Housing?|
54892|What is the Housing System?|
54893|#823$#Well, uh, it's your house.
#822$#Surely you haven't forgotten about your house...|
54894|#821$#It's a place that belongs to you, the one place you're free to decorate as you like.
#823$#Not only that, it's a good place for Nakama and I to play together.|
54895|#823$#You house is beautifully decorated...
#824$#I want a house of my own...
#823$#Somewhere just for you and me.|
54896|#822$#Have you hired a housekeeper yet?
#823$#If not, then Nakama can manage the house for you.
#821$#He can do lots of things... like become a bomb, or act as a sandbag...
#824$#Don't look at me like that, Nakama!|
54901|Do you like books?|
54902|What kind of books do you like to read?|
54903|#823$#Have you heard of the Book of the Dead? It's my favorite book.|
54904|#823$#I love it, there's so much you can learn from it!|
54905|#822$#How about you? Do you like to read? Do you like books too?|
54906|#824$#You don't?
#821$#You can pick up all sorts of interesting information from books. You should try reading sometime!|
54911|Tell me about Nakama.|
54912|What's your connection to Nakama?|
54913|#821$#You want to know about Nakama and me? Nakama IS me! I am Nakama!
#823$# It's a supernatural connection!|
54914|#824$#Why are you asking these questions?
#821$#We're just friends. Now leave me alone!|
54915|#822$#What relationship?
#824$#I'm not sure what you're asking...|
54916|#823$#It's a very close relationship! Closer than you and I, that's for sure.
#821$#Because Nakama and I have been together since birth...|
54921|I hear that you're kind of a smartypants.|
54922|Do you know much trivia?|
54923|#823$#I know lots of pointless things!
#822$#Like what? Like you. What's the point of YOU?
#824$#Heehee! Just kidding. I'm not that mean, really.|
54924|#823$#If there's anything you want to know, just ask me!
#821$#I'll be able to answer any question!|
54925|#821$#The books say that if you're attacked by a crocodile,
#822$#you should give it a good poke in the eye and it will let you go...
#823$#if you ever get a chance, you should try it!|
54926|#821$#Do you know which organ stays unchanged from birth?
#823$#The pipe organ! Get it? Yeah, I'm thinking of a career in comedy. Pretty good, right?|
54931|That costume is too cute!|
54932|Can you tell me about it?|
54933|#822$#You like it?
#823$#The decoration on the top, I made it myself!|
54934|#821$#Isn't it pretty?
#823$#The hat and the earphones are my favorite parts.|
54935|#822$#I like this costume too.
#821$#It's got lots of sparkly bits on the top. What do you think?|
54936|#821$#I put this little number together myself...
#822$#It has some sparkly little bits on the top. Nakama helped out with a few ideas too.|
54941|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
54942|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
54943|#821$#Did you know that Yumikaze's eagle is called Ruffles?
#822$#It's because Eidolons love to eat chips!
#823$#They're snacking addicts! They can't help themselves!|
54944|#821$#I heard that one of the Eidolon has a huge library full of books...
#824$#It's so massive, you might get lost in there and starve to death!
#822$#You'll never find your way out!|
54945|#822$#Hel is very beautiful, and super down to earth...
#821$#What? Hel has a terrible sense of direction. She goes out for five minutes and she gets lost.
#823$#Someone needs to get her a map.|
54946|#822$#Have you heard of Cesela?
#821$#The tambourine player doesn't seem to know the first thing about music!
#823$#Would you like to see Nakama play the tambourine?|
54951|What happens to dead souls?|
54952|Where do people go when they die?|
54953|#821$#Extinguished souls are reincarnated...
#822$#The physical body is but a transient vessel.
#823$#Even yours, Master, but when you die, I'm sure you'll be reborn.|
54954|#822$#Do you believe me? Dead souls are reborn.
#823$#As long as your soul stays as pure as it is now,
#821$#I'm sure we'll meet again in the next life.|
54955|#821$#Do you fear death?
#823$#There's no need to be scared. For a soul, death is just a change of state. Like water and ice.
#822$#With luck, your soul will be reborn.|
54956|#821$#When the physical body dies, the soul floats away
#822$#to accept judgment.
#823$#Once the soul has been judged, it can sail on the wind and ride on the ship of eternal sunbeams.|
54961|What is the Book of the Dead?|
54962|Does the Book of the Dead have any interesting uses?|
54963|#821$#This book is a guide to the Book of the Dead...
#822$#Study it and there will be no end to what you can do!
#823$#Read and learn. You can achieve immortality!|
54964|#821$#It's called the Book of the Dead, but it's not written on paper.
#822$#You look like you want to ask a question.
#823$#Some chapters are carved on tombstones or into the walls of mausoleums.|
54965|#821$#The Book of the Dead isn't actually a single book...
#822$#Each person's Book of the Dead is unique.
#823$#I'd dearly love to see your Book of the Dead.|
54966|#821$#Did you know that each person has their own unique Book of the Dead?
#822$#That's because no two lives are the same.
#823$#I'm sure yours must be chock full of beautiful illustrations and poems.|
54971|Where are you from?|
54972|Where do you come from?|
54973|#823$#I come from Nakama's cloak, as does Nakama.
#822$#What? How could Nakama appear from his own cloak? You'll have to ask Nakama that.
#821$#Nakama, don't look at me like I'm an idiot!|
54974|#823$#Nakama and I are temple guardians.
#822$#When you come to be judged at the temple, I'll be there at the gates to welcome you.
#823$#If you treat me well, I may help you get a favorable judgment!
#824$#Don't go tattling on me, Nakama!|
54975|#823$#I'm a temple guardian.
#824$#If any enemies attack, I burn them to ash with my light rays.|
54976|#823$#Naturally, I appeared from Nakama's cloak.
#821$#Would you like to try appearing from Nakama's cloak?
#824$#Nakama's looking at me like I'm an idiot again! You can't scold me!|
54981|Do you like to exercise?|
54982|Are you an athlete?|
54983|#822$#What's exercise? It's when you get your body moving. Oh, in that case, yes! I love to exercise!|
54984|#822$#I'm no athlete, of course...
#821$#I'm a temple guardian. I can't leave my post.|
54985|#823$#I love to exercise with Nakama.
#822$#Do you want to play with me?
#821$#You can be the ball and I'll kick you! Just kidding, heehee!|
54986|#823$#Do you want to exercise with me?
#821$#Or you could try with Nakama!|
54991|Have you thought about what your life will be like after we part ways?|
54992|What's your plan after we split up?|
54993|#824$#I haven't really thought about it...
#822$#We would hate to be separated from you, believe me! We're not going anywhere!|
54994|#822$#Maybe we'd go back to the temple...
#821$#Even though I'd hate to part with you, I'd just have to make the best of it!|
54995|#821$#Nakama and I would go back to the temple.
#822$#And there we would wait for the day of judgment.|
54996|#824$#I don't want to even think about it!|
55101|How do you define strength?|
55102|What are your thoughts about strength?|
55103|#821$#Only one who is weak would ask this sort of question...
#822$#Think about that, little human.|
55104|#824$#What a meaningless question... You'd never be happy with my answer.
#821$#Compared to the rest of the pitiful human race, I'll admit you're pretty strong.|
55105|#821$#I, Dante, am the answer to that question. I am strength personified.|
55106|#821$#The answer is right in front of you.|
55111|Let's conquer the world!|
55112|Conquer the world!|
55113|#822$#The world? You have no vision.|
55114|#822$#I really wonder... Human, have you never thought overthrowing the Grand Bishop and claiming his throne?
#821$#You could become ruler of the land... of the world!|
55115|#822$#The dumb look on your face reminds me of what that queen said... what was it...?
#821$#"Behind every great man, there's an even greater woman pulling the strings."
#823$#Haha... What a joke!|
55116|#823$#Wow! Finally a human with a little backbone!
#821$#It reminds me of a time when I was so eager for greatness!|
55121|Do you have any regrets?|
55122|Have you ever regretted anything?|
55123|#821$#I've done what I've done. What is there to regret?
#824$#Believe me, even if you could go back in time, you wouldn't change a thing.|
55124|#824$#Regret is the most useless emotion in the world.|
55125|#822$#What? What's so confusing? Humans are so weird...|
55126|#824$#Don't you think that the here and now is more important than the past?|
55131|Have you ever met your match in battle?|
55132|If you ran into a monster that was stronger than you, what would you do?|
55133|#823$#I have no idea. I've never encountered an opponent who was stronger than me.|
55134|#823$#Hahaha! A strong enemy?! I have searched my entire life for a worthy opponent!|
55135|#822$#Don't you have any confidence in yourself? Hmph... I wouldn't think that this type of thing would bother you.|
55136|#822$#Can you explain more? What do you consider a strong enemy?|
55141|What's your most memorable experience?|
55142|Do you have an unforgettable memory?|
55143|#824$#It was... the first time that I was humiliated... Oh it was terrible!|
55144|#822$#When the name Uriel appeared in my quest objective... It really...
#821$#No... Human, forget what I just said.|
55145|#821$#Once, there were quite a few people who doubted my abilities.
#823$#In the end... I took them all and... Haha, they were so overconfident. It was their downfall in the end.|
55146|#823$#The look on your face when I first showed up was, unforgettable... Hahaha!|
55151|Let's talk about some of the different races in this world.|
55152|What do you know about some of the world's races?|
55153|#821$#It's astounding how many different races inhabit the world.
#823$#The arrogance of the Makar is admirable.|
55154|#821$#What's that dwarvish race called... the Dwarves? How original...
#822$#I'm really curious what lies behind that mask...|
55155|#821$#The Butterfly Fairies have such a reverence for nature. I admire their culture.
#823$#Hmph... But they're such a pretentious, foolish race.|
55156|#822$#Since you asked, weren't you born on this land too?|
55161|Heard any good gossip lately?|
55162|Have the spirits said anything about what's happening elsewhere?|
55163|#821$#About that... You probably know more than me, no?|
55164|#822$#I heard the Mirabelle Association gives quests to adventurers.
#821$#I don't know what they're end goal is, but it's always simple tasks.
#822$#Why don't you go take a look if you're interested? I'm not actually interested.|
55165|#821$#To this day, I can't figure out what the Templars actually believe...
#822$#The Cube of Gaia? Really?|
55166|#821$#There so many different types of organizations... Humans really like to band together.
#823$#I mean... there are even organizations for archaeology and fishing. How frivolous can you get.|
55171|Can you tell me anything about the Sky Tower?|
55172|Please tell me about the Sky Tower.|
55173|#821$#It's easy to climb up to the top. It shouldn't pose any difficulty for you.|
55174|#821$#The Sky Tower is a pretty amazing building in terms of human technology...
#822$#Human, have you ever wondered why they hide things in the tower? Are they trying to lead you to your death?|
55175|#821$#You can't go there by yourself. You need to find some people to go with you!
#822$#Don't humans have some kind of battle organization called... a guild or something?|
55176|#823$#Of course, I could easily climb up to the top...
#825$#You, on the other hand, should probably form a team... Don't forget that you humans are pretty fragile.|
55181|Can you tell me a bit about the Auction House?|
55182|What's the Auction House for?|
55183|#822$#Human... you're a bit much. You don't have to ask me about everything.|
55184|#822$#You aren't as knowledgeable as I had originally imagined. Go do your own homework!|
55185|#821$#If you've got some useless junk lying around, you can pawn it off onto some other hapless fool.
#823$#But if you don't want it, I don't think anyone else will either!|
55186|#822$#"Money is freedom that you create." What? Are you chasing freedom too?|
55191|Can you explain the classes?|
55192|What do you think about classes?|
55193|#821$#This tachi that I use is called "Darkflame." Do you know what the most powerful weapon is?|
55194|#822$#The impressive shinobi clans... Although it seems like they just hide in the dark,
#821$#you have to admit that they have many skilled members...|
55195|#821$#Pick one that you like. It's all the same to me.
#822$#Maybe... Do you prefer a more hands-on approach? You can bash monsters with your fists! Just something to consider.|
55196|#824$#What's there to talk about?.. Boring.|
55201|Can I sell my soul to you?|
55202|Do you really reap souls?|
55203|#824$#What?.. Where exactly did that rumor start?
#822$#You're not the first human to ask me this.|
55204|#824$#... Do you want your soul engulfed in an abyss of eternal night? Does that sound FUN to you?!
#822$#... Why are you so excited by this?
#822$#I really don't understand what goes on in the minds of humans.|
55205|#822$#Have you been brainwashed by those boring rumors as well?
#824$#... It makes no difference to me what kind of special hobbies you have. I don't want to know.|
55206|#824$#So boring.|
55211|Are you lord of the underworld?|
55212|I heard that you're king of the demons...|
55213|#822$#... What do you think?|
55214|#822$#You did your homework? I'm surprised!
#821$#I don't know where you heard that, but you should forget it ASAP.|
55215|#8231$#Hahaha! What did Uriel say to you?|
55216|#824$#Mere humans think they can just reach across the heavens and meddle with the underworld...?
#821$#It's a shame... the demons who have invaded Terra have no connection to me.
#822$#My underworld kingdom is... No, pretend I didn't say anything.|
55221|How come you don't spread your wings in battle?|
55222|Where are your wings?|
55223|#821$#Ants in the human realm, demons in the underworld, angels in heaven...
#824$#I don't need to control everyone, do I?|
55224|#821$#... Why don't YOU spread YOUR wings?
#823$#You don't have any? Really? That's a pity.|
55225|#821$#My wings... They are proof that I was once an angel.
#823$#Hahaha, I've almost forgotten what it feels like to use them to fly.|
55226|#824$#They're more than enough to deal with these ants.|
55231|You seem so arrogant...|
55232|You have a bad attitude.|
55233|#824$#To have the guts to talk to me like that... You must have come to some sort of realization.|
55234|#821$#Arrogant... That old man said the same thing to me...
#822$#Human, what do you think it means to be an angel? To conform to what the universe expects from you?
#824$#Hmph... it's all a joke.|
55235|#824$#... Unsheathe your weapon. I won't kill a defenseless person.|
55236|#823$#The strong have the right to be arrogant.|
55241|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
55242|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
55243|#821$#You want to hear about the other Eidolons? Hmm... Gossip, that's just like you.
#822$#... Have you ever heard about Kusanagi? He's always looking for a fight, but he's never come to me!
#823$#The reason? I'm sure he's afraid he'll lose! Hahaha!|
55244|#824$#Are humans so bored that they have to gossip about other people?|
55245|#822$#Yes... Let me think. You know about the wings that Uzuriel used to have, right?
#823$#It's such a pity... Her pure white wings gradually turned black. It was quite the sight...|
55246|#823$#Zephyrine's taste in music... Hmph, it's ridiculous!
#821$#Do you always have to sing hymns?|
55251|You were once an angel?|
55252|Are you a devil?|
55253|#823$#Haha, did Uriel tell you that?... No... now he's called Uriel.
#821$#I cherish the days when I was in paradise...|
55254|#8231$#Haha, I've forgotten whether it is or it isn't...|
55255|#821$#Hmph, it doesn't matter what I am. I'm still powerful!
#824$#That opinionated old man dared to cast me out... He'll pay for that!|
55256|#821$#I'm neither angel nor devil...
#822$#What do you think I am?|
55261|I heard that you started a war?|
55262|A war among the gods...|
55263|#821$#A mere human dares ask about the matters of the gods?
#824$#Watch your tone!|
55264|#821$#That wasn't just a war... It affected a great many things!
#822$#Solomon gave me a large, surprising gift...
#823$#Who would leave that place after a gift like that?|
55265|#823$#Haha, why are you trying to kick up such a fuss in Terra?|
55266|#824$#... I don't want to talk about that. Human, don't you have any other questions?|
55271|How about The Organization?|
55272|Do you know about The Organization?|
55273|#821$#Oh? That name takes me back... Where did you hear it?
#822$#Is the person who mentioned it... still alive? It seems like The Organization has disbanded.
#821$#Now, might be a good opportunity...|
55274|#823$#Hahaha, the most intolerable thing about humans is their curiosity!
#822$#It's nothing special. Sooner or later, I will annihilate it.|
55275|#823$#Angel's Paradise... Ha! Ridiculous!|
55276|#824$#Such a brazen question. You've got guts.|
55281|What are your thoughts on angels?|
55282|Do you like angels?|
55283|#821$#Angels... make me think about things from long ago...
#822$#Yes? Why are you staring at me like that? You think I'm going to tell you about them?|
55284|#821$#The burden of so-called "justice" is its killing tool...
#823$#That's what an angel really is. It's fascinating. Fascinating, I tell you!|
55285|#821$#Angels? Of course! They're all blind hypocrites!
#823$#I couldn't care less about angels.|
55286|#821$#Angels are detestable. They are a divine annoyance.|
55291|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
55292|What's your plan after we part ways?|
55293|#821$#What? Are you one to die so easily?
#823$#Haha... No, I don't think so...|
55294|#821$#I'll just find another human who can replace you.
#822$#... Even if I have to search for a lifetime...|
55295|#824$#You've got some guts, human... Don't even think about leaving until I say you can!|
55296|#823$#Hahaha, where did you think you could escape to?|
55401|Is there anyone that you have a crush on?|
55402|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
55403|#821$#Of course-
#822$#Ayako loves her sister more than anyone in the world!|
55404|#825$#But Master is her second favorite!
#821$#Don't get any ideas, Master, thinking you can replace my sister!|
55405|#824$#I'll never tell! It's a secret!|
55406|#823$#Okay, I'd tell Master... But only if Master gives Ayako some food!|
55411|Do you like animals?|
55412|What's your favorite animal?|
55413|#821$#I'm a carnivore! All animals look tasty to me...
#826$#Gretel looks like she'd make a good snack.
#824$# Hey! Don't give me that look! Ayako absolutely didn't say Gretel looks tasty! Just that she's good at preparing snack foods!|
55414|#821$#Yay! Ayako just loves calves! They're the cutest!
#822$#This one time, there was a calf that Hel ate.
#826$#It looked so tasty.|
55415|#821$#Wait, why are you asking about this?
#822$#You're just making me hungry...
#824$#Won't you feed me something? Just a scrap?|
55416|#825$#Ayako likes to eat anything! Or everything!
#821$#That's why Ayako loves to watch Master sleep.
#823$#Eh? What's that? I didn't say anything! Where are you going?|
55421|What do you do in your free time?|
55422|How do you like to kick back and relax?|
55423|#821$#Ayako can do many things...
#825$#Cleaning ear hair, combing tail hair, other hair stuff, I dunno...
#824$#Eating your face... So, Master doesn't appreciate Ayako's great talents and abilities?|
55424|#821$#Master clearly hasn't seen Ayako's magnificent ice sculptures!
#823$#Does Master like to eat ice? Ayako loves it.|
55425|#823$#Ayako loves to go to inferno to play with Hel!
#821$#But Hel is never there...
#824$#Ayako waits and waits...and gets hungry...|
55426|#821$#Eh....Where's Master? This was an interesting story! What the--
#823$#Okay then, let's talk about Master instead then. What does Master like to do? Tell Ayako!|
55431|What's your favorite color?|
55432|Any preferences about color?|
55433|#821$#Ayako likes red, yellow, pink, blue, black and white!
#823$#Basically everything. What about Master? Master, won't you please tell Ayako your favorite color?|
55434|#821$#Ayako likes tasty colors!
#822$#White like bones, red like meat...
#824$#Don't look at me like that, Master! Ayako... Ayako is not drooling! Maybe a tiny bit.|
55435|#821$#Ayako likes lots of colors.
#823$#But my favorite is the color of Master's skin.
#826$#Every time I look at Master... I want a bite...|
55436|#821$#Did I say something? Ayako likes the color of Master's clothes.
#822$#They look... rather tasty...
#824$#Eh? What's that? Hey, where are you going?|
55441|Do you like to travel?|
55442|What are your opinions on traveling?|
55443|#823$#Ayako loves it! Does Master want to take Ayako somewhere?
#824$#Ayako wants to taste food from everywhere! Please, let's go on a trip!|
55444|#823$#Ayako loves it so much!
#822$#Because whenever I am with Master, I know there will be lots of food for Ayako. So much good food for Ayako!
#823$#Ayako loves traveling with Master!|
55445|#821$#Ayako is happy to travel with Master!
#823$#Does Master feel the same about Ayako?|
55446|#822$#As long as Ayako has food to eat, Ayako is happy.|
55451|Do you know anything about Shuriken?|
55452|I need some information about Shuriken...|
55453|#821$#Shuriken? Ayako knows!
#823$#I know someone who plays with Shuriken.|
55454|#821$#I've heard they fight with the power of shadows!
#823$#Master! Doesn't that sound fascinating?
#822$#I wonder what shadow meat tastes like... Can you bring me some?|
55455|#821$#Oh? Oh, you're wondering about Shuriken, are you?
#823$#Well, Ayako just happens to be an expert on the subject.|
55456|#821$#Let me see... It has something to do with Ninjutsu, right?
#825$#And... you eat it?|
55461|What is the Viridian Steppe like?|
55462|Could you tell me about the Viridian Steppe?|
55463|#821$#Yes, yes. Ayako has been there once.
#823$#When Hel was little, I got lost there...
#824$#Ayako was so scared... but luckily, nothing happened.|
55464|#821$#The stargazing centaurs live there.
#823$#Does Master like fortune-telling too? Perhaps I could try telling your fortune!
#825$#Or, if Master knows fortune-telling, can you do it for me?|
55465|#821$#Ayako knows. There's a huge grass field over there.
#823$#It's perfect for running and playing.
#822$#Shall we go? Oh, please, let's go play there!|
55466|#821$#My younger brother seems to know...
#823$#Shall I ask Jormungand for you?|
55471|What is the Desolate Valley like?|
55472|What can you tell me about the Desolate Valley?|
55473|#821$#Well, the guardian of the Holy Sword lives there.
#823$#Does Master want the Holy Sword?
#822$#He could probably use it to cut up some nice, juicy meat for Fenrir.|
55474|#821$#Well, its a valley. It's desolate. What more do you need to know?
#824$#The name says it all. Don't tell me you want to go there, of all places! Can't we go somewhere nice?|
55475|#821$#Well, Ayako knows there's good cuisine!
#825$#Choice Barbecue Steak comes from there! Oh my gosh, so delicious.
#823$#So hungry! Can we go eat it now? C'mon, let's get steak!|
55476|#821$#Man, oh man. Desolate? I don't even know what that word means. Why are you asking me? Do I look like a tour guide to you?
#824$#I don't know, okay!? Just feed me!|
55481|Could you tell me about the cabinet?|
55482|What is the cabinet?|
55483|#821$#Cabinet... that's where humans put their clothes, isn't it?
#823$#If Ayako had a cabinet, it'd be to stock all her bones and food!|
55484|#821$#Er? It's just a cabinet.
#823$#You keep clothes in it. Can you stop with the weirdo questions? I wanna eat.|
55485|#821$#It's a cabinet. Who cares?
#822$#Can we eat soon please?
#824$#Sob... I am so hungry!|
55486|#824$#I don't know, okay!? Just feed me!|
55491|Do you know about house building and decorating?|
55492|Can you tell me anything about these houses I've been hearing so much about?|
55493|#821$#Did I say something? Well, uh, it's your house. It's Ayako's house, too.|
55494|#821$#So make sure you stock it with lots of meat.
#823$#Meat meat meat meat meat meat meat meat meat meat.
#824$#What is it?|
55495|#821$#Why, it's a magical place where you can decorate freely.
#823$#You can put pictures of meat all over! Meat rugs! Meat windows! Hey, Master... Do you think we could fill the bathtub in your house with meat?
#822$#Uh... What kind of meat? Bloody, juicy, delicious MEAT!|
55496|#821$#It's a... a beautiful place with a huge grass field outside!
#826$#I really wanna roll on it...|
55501|Why did you come to Terra?|
55502|Why did you want to be with me?|
55503|#823$#Because there are a lot of fun places in Terra. And loads of delicious food, of course.|
55504|#821$#Plus, I like you!
#823$#What about Master? Do you like me too?|
55505|#821$#Well, I just like to run around.
#822$#And there's so many nice places here to run and run and run!
#823$#It's perfect!|
55506|#821$#Hm... Master... I had a dream...
#825$#I dreamed I saw a huge bone, and I wanted to eat it!
#824$#I woke up... and the first thing I saw... was you, Master! So, I knew it was meant to be.|
55511|Do you know much about Gram?|
55512|Can you tell me anything about Gram?|
55513|#821$#Gram? I didn't know Master knew about Gram!
#822$#Gram was my present to Hel...
#821$#I was afraid that Hel would be lonely, so I send her Gram to keep her company!|
55514|#825$#Gram is a servant I sent to serve Hel.
#821$#When Hel was small, Gram was already there with her...
#824$#They are a good match. Don't you think?|
55515|#821$#Hel told Gram he was her brother...but he was just a servant...
#822$#I shouldn't spread that around. I hope Hel's not listening!
#824$#Um, forget I said anything! If anyone asks, you didn't hear it from me.|
55516|#821$#Gram's the best! Ayako loves to play with Gram!
#822$#When we were little, Every time I saw Hel, we always played knights!
#823$#We rode on Gram. Everyone was scared of us! It was super fun!|
55521|I dunno! I heard Hel had three brothers. Maybe one of them is Gram?|
55522|What's your gender?|
55523|#823$#Hel is so cute, don't you think?|
55524|#822$#Three? Hel only has two brothers, right?
#824$#Oh... You are talking about Gram...|
55525|#823$#Yes? Do you want to be like me?
#824$#But Hel is my sister... I won't give her to you...|
55526|#821$#What gender? Ayako has no gender. Ayako is Ayako...
#822$#But Hel is my sister... my lil' sister.|
55531|What are your weaknesses?|
55532|Is there anything you aren't good at?|
55533|#823$#Ayako has no weakness!
#822$#Oh? Food, I guess that's my weakness.
#824$#There's never enough of it.|
55534|#821$#Ayako has no weakness! Ayako is the best!
#824$#Your face... Hahaha, what a burn!
#823$#C'mon, whatcha gonna do about it, ya sissy. Fight me? You know I'll win!|
55535|#821$#I ought to clean up this room...
#824$#I always trip over this stupid rag!
#823$#Darn! Hey, don't give me that look. It was the rag!|
55536|#821$#My biggest fear is that Hel gets angry...
#824$#The last time she was angry... she didn't talk to me for a long time...
#825$#You really need to be careful not to irritate Hel... She's got a temper.|
55541|What secrets can you tell me about the other Eidolon?|
55542|So... Any juicy Eidolon gossip?|
55543|#823$#You know the Bringer of Light? No? In that case, Ayako doesn't know either!
#825$#Who's that mean guy who makes Hel sad?
#824$#I just want to punch him in the face!|
55544|#821$#Alucard? Oh wait! No! You must mean Grandpa Vayu! Yeah, of course I know who he is.
#822$#He just seems to be looking for someone,
#824$#But don't ask me who! He's pretty old already.|
55545|#821$#Gretel? Gretel is a sweet little sheep.
#825$#I wonder if she tastes like mutton... hmm...
#824$#Hey, don't look at me like that! I'm not actually going to eat her! Well, maybe just a nibble, for science?|
55546|#822$#Ol' Man Vayu really looks like Gram...
#823$#Master! If I gave Old Vayu to Hel as a gift,
#825$#Do you think she'd appreciate it?|
55551|Uh, is that a real lock on your neck?|
55552|What's the deal with that?|
55553|#821$#Oh... Well, basically, long story short, it was a trade. If I wear it,
#824$#I get to eat a ton of good food... I didn't want to put it on, but...
#823$#Hey! Don't give me that disapproving look! Let's see what you would do if I promised you some nice, hot food. Or maybe some chocolate? Yeah, that's what I thought!|
55554|#824$#Yeah, I don't really know.
#822$#This dude said he likes Ayako, so he gave Ayako this as a gift...
#821$#I can't really say 'no' to free stuff... Even if it wasn't the most useful present.|
55555|#821$#Look, uh. It's kind of a sore topic, alright?
#822$#Let's not talk about it.
#824$#It just makes me sad, and hungry.|
55556|#821$#Lock? Oh, you mean my chain.
#823$#It's super strong.
#824$#I used to be upset about it. But I'm pretty used to it now. Plus, it helps me control my appetite a bit.|
55561|Do you have any siblings?|
55562|Tell me about your family.|
55563|#821$#Oh, you mean my sister Hel, right?
#824$#Yeah, she's cute and all. It's a shame she has absolutely NO sense of direction.|
55564|#821$#I have a younger sister, a younger brother... and my father...
#822$#Or maybe you wanted to ask about my mother?
#824$#Sob... My mom is not around anymore... I miss her so much...|
55565|#821$#Hel looks a lot like my mom, but my brother takes after my dad...
#825$#When I was little, we used to play hide-and-seek with Gram.
#823$#Jormungand would always find me...
#824$#And then I had to always clean up the messes we made... Sob... That used to make Ayako so miserable!|
55566|#821$#I know Hel said she wanted a younger brother...
#824$#But Ayako is happy to only have a little sister... I don't want a brother!|
55571|Who could we match up with Hel?|
55572|Let's find Hel a mate!|
55573|#821$#Hm... I dunno...
#825$#Jormungand is very smart... He always finds me, wherever I hide...
#824$#Maybe I shouldn't hide under the table...|
55574|#822$#My younger brother says we can only choose someone who can beat me in a fight...
#824$#...So I guess not you, then. Haha! To be fair, not too many people can beat me.
#823$#But why do you ask -- does Master want to marry Hel?|
55575|#825$#I'm sure that Father has set lots of conditions too...
#821$#Like...social status... family background... personality...
#824$#Man, oh man. He's not an easy guy to please, my dear ol' dad.|
55576|#821$#Oh man, You wanna marry Hel?
#822$#Ha! Just wait till I tell her! She's gonna die laughing!
#823$#What a dork you are sometimes, Master.|
55581|Do you always eat so much?|
55582|Why are you always hungry?|
55583|#821$#What? Does Ayako eat a lot?
#822$#I never thought so. I eat when I'm hungry, that's all. Is that a lot?
#823$#Why do you look upset? Did you just fall?|
55584|#823$#Ayako wants to eat food from all over the world!
#826$#That's why I like being with Master! We're always traveling!|
55585|#824$#Ayako is hungry...
#823$#Master... Is there any food left?|
55586|#822$#I'm obsessed with food... I even dream about it.
#824$#And no one wants to sleep near me anymore...
#823$#Why? They said I would bite them. But I wouldn't!|
55591|Have you thought about how your life will be after we've parted ways?|
55592|What's your plan for the future?|
55593|#824$#I don't want to talk about it.
#823$#Thinking about that depresses me.|
55594|#821$#I guess Ayako...will return to the wild...
#822$#Or maybe... I'll just have to kill and eat Master?
#824$#No! Only kidding, Master! I'd never do that, honest!|
55595|#821$#Eh? What's that? Master, where are you going!
#825$#Well... I'll probably go find Hel first, and wait for Master...|
55596|#826$#Don't you worry. Ayako will be always by your side!|
55701|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
55702|What do you do to kill time?|
55703|#821$#I really like to sit in the palace atrium and play the harp.
#823$#I love to lose myself in the beautiful music as it surrounds me...|
55704|#822$#I once received an invitation to dance at Master Odin's party.
#821$#Moonlight spilled gently into the room. The flower petals on me followed my movements and gracefully fluttered to the floor...
#822$#It's just... when I finished dancing... I was surrounded by people...
#824$#The way they looked at me was very unsettling...|
55705|#821$#Do you like listening to music?
#822$#If you do, perhaps next time I will sing a song for you...
#823$#Even Master Odin himself has great admiration for my voice.|
55706|#821$#I think I'd like to hold my own solo concert soon...
#823$#Do you like music too? Perhaps we can listen to the performance together in your room.|
55711|What's your favorite food?|
55712|What do you normally eat?|
55713|#822$#My favorite food?
#821$#I think it must be a dessert... or something sweet...
#823$#I also feel happy seeing other people eat delicious food.|
55714|#821$#Occasionally... I drink some morning rose dew when I wake up early...
#822$#Does it taste good?.. That's a tough question...
#823$#Maybe I could put it like this... When I drink it, I feel as if it's cleansing my mind and body.|
55715|#824$#All this talk about food reminds me of the spicy escargot skewers you brought me last time...
#822$#Huh?... No, I didn't hate them. It's just... I don't really know how to eat this type of food...|
55716|#821$#He once gave me a snow cake! Now that's my kinda dessert!
#822$#Ah! Of course I like what you brought me too! Haha...
#823$#As long as we're talking about it, the tastiness of the food isn't important.|
55721|What is the meaning of life?|
55722|What is life's purpose, according to you?|
55723|#821$#Life, for me, is everything.
#823$#Once... as long as he was by my side, I felt my life was complete.
#824$#However, ever since I met you... I've felt that there's been a gap... It doesn't seem so complete anymore.|
55724|#821$#Once... he was the only person in my life, in my world...
#823$#He was all I could see. As long as he was happy, I was happy...
#824$#But you make me feel this way too...|
55725|#821$#Life is a representative of endless strife...
#824$#No matter if it's long or short, it's always full of conflict...
#821$#Like you, like us...|
55726|#822$#It represents new ideas.
#823$#New life can bring hope to the world.|
55731|Have you ever been in love?|
55732|Have you ever been in a relationship?|
55733|#822$#Yes... I'm not sure what humans mean by "relationships", however.
#821$#Do you mean someone who is close to me?
#823$#Haha, that would be you right now.|
55734|#822$#Well then... maybe not...
#821$#How about you? Have you had a partner like this?|
55735|#823$#Are you vying for my affection now, too?
#824$#... No, really? Yes... direct denial makes me feel a bit upset...|
55736|#824$#I just don't understand what you mean by a "relationship." How do you have one?
#821$#In the past... I was just always with him, ever since I was little...
#823$#If I am with you now, can we call it a relationship? You're the only partner I've had like that...|
55741|What do you think about art?|
55742|Tell me about aesthetics.|
55743|#821$#Do you mean the contours of a sculpture or the brush strokes of a painting?
#823$#When I visited the golden palace, the sculptures were amazing!
#822$#Are you interested? Next time, I'll take you along to have a look.|
55744|#823$#Once someone praised me as I sat playing music. I wanted to recreate a view of Valhalla.
#821$#If I played a certain rhythm in just the right way, it would draw a large crowd... They would become lost in my music...
#823$#Does that... answer your question? Hah...|
55745|#821$#I felt my heart shake when I first set foot in Tanglevine Cascades...
#823$#The sky, the ground, the buildings even the air all had this feeling of beauty...
#822$#That beauty... is perhaps the ultimate art...|
55746|#821$#In my eyes, your entire being is combination of art and aesthetics, a representation of the sublime.
#822$#Of course, you're good-looking on the outside.
#823$#But it's your soul, your heart, that makes me unable to take my eyes off of you.|
55751|Let's talk about some of the different races in this world.|
55752|What do you know about some of the world's races?|
55753|#822$#This world is vast. It's natural that there would be so many species surviving and evolving throughout the land.
#821$#They vary in style, dress, customs, and beliefs.
#823$#We must be careful. We can't just do whatever we want. We might violate one of their cultural taboos.|
55754|#822$#The Makar are a race with complex and delicate social morays.
#821$#If you're not very careful, it's easy to break one of their taboos...
#824$#... I don't get it really. Why does petting their fur and telling them they're cute make them angry?|
55755|#822$#Dwarves are master craftsmen.
#821$#They have focus, a strong work ethic, and they put their hearts and souls into every one of their machines.
#823$#Even if it's just a polished gem, you can't take your eyes off of it.|
55756|#821$#Do you know about the Centaurs? They're masters of astrology.
#822$#They can see events of the past and the future simply by watching the movements of the stars.
#821$#Yes... I wonder if they're willing to divine my fate with him...|
55761|Do you know anything about the Shuriken?|
55762|Tell me about the Shuriken.|
55763|#821$#It is a weapon that comes from the East... right?
#822$#I've seen people use it as a hair accessory as well.
#824$#If you wear it on your head, won't it cut you? I wonder how that works...|
55764|#823$#Yes... it's this weapon that is used by the so-called "Shinobi"...
#821$#I'm sorry, I don't really know what Ninjutsu is, actually...|
55765|#822$#Isn't it a type of weapon that's normally a crisscross shape?
#821$#If you really want to know, maybe we can study it together.
#823$#Now that you've mentioned it, I'm interested in it as well.|
55766|#822$#Ah! Is it the thing that Tsubaki threw last time? I think I heard that she was practicing!
#821$#If you don't need an answer right away...
#823$#Please give me some time. Let me get to the bottom of it and get back to you later. Okay?|
55771|What can we do to help people in need?|
55772|To help the people in need...|
55773|#821$#I once heard that you humans formed a... yeah... it was called the Mirabelle Association, right?
#822$#I think this association posts requests that come from people in need.
#823$#Perhaps you'd be interested?|
55774|#821$#It's very important to be willing to help others. I'm glad to see you so motivated.
#823$#No matter what you encounter in the future, I hope you'll never lose your kind heart.|
55775|#823$#You want to help people in need? That's a great idea.
#821$#Thoughtful ideas have a magic to them. They can affect people who are just around them.
#824$#If everyone throughout the world held these ideas... War would be a thing of the past.|
55776|#822$#Did someone ask you for help?
#821$#Then do everything you can to help that person.
#823$#If someone came to you in need, then that proves that I was right about you.|
55781|Do you have your own Guardian Knight?|
55782|Do you know of the Guardian Knights?|
55783|#821$#Guardian Knights? Are you talking about the one that I like?
#823$#Then it must be him... But then there's you, too...|
55784|#822$#I'm not so sure...
#821$#If we're talking about the one who I'm closest with right now, that would be you...
#823$#Well, are you willing to be my Guardian Knight? Ha!|
55785|#822$#If I say no, would you suggest yourself?
#824$#Why do you look so surprised? That makes me a bit upset.|
55786|#821$#"As long as the guardian relationship has concluded, mutual bonds can be deepened by fishing or adventuring."
#823$#"As bonds strengthen, the love between the two will increase as well." Do you know about this?
#821$#What am I reading? This is information that I asked Eternia to write for me!|
55791|Can you tell me about the housing system?|
55792|What is the housing system?|
55793|#824$#That's the place where you live... right? Do you not know how to get home?
#822$#Hehe, it doesn't matter. We can just head back to my palace.
#823$#Brave warriors are always welcome there.|
55794|#821$#Everything from the furniture, to the colors, to the decorations say something about the owner.
#822$#It's a reflection of an individual's personality.
#823$#Entering another person's house is like entering their heart.|
55795|#822$#It's a place where you can do a lot of things.
#821$#For example? Like fishing... or farming...
#823$#If you've never tried it, then maybe we can learn more about it together!|
55796|#821$#You can hire a housekeeper for your house to take care of the housework.
#822$#If you need a recommendation, there are several exemplary housekeepers at my palace.
#823$#If you need to, I can introduce you to one.|
55801|Do you like music at all?|
55802|What kind of music do you normally like to listen to?|
55803|#822$#I quite like sweet, elegant music.
#821$#Think classical... and other similar types.
#824$#I can't stand noise! Some music crosses that line.|
55804|#821$#I like all types of music!
#822$#Are you asking about specific songs?
#823$#I'm thrilled that you are interested in getting to know me better.|
55805|#822$#I once borrowed some headphones from Zephyrine and got some of her recommendations.
#824$#... I'd like to at least understand what the singers are saying.|
55806|#821$#I once went to an underground concert. I was smitten by the guitarist!
#822$#He looked so handsome, but he had a bad temper... He almost burned up my headband...
#824$#Why? Near the end of the show, he used magic to create a pyrotechnic display! I'm just glad no one was seriously hurt.|
55811|It seems you really cherish this harp.|
55812|Do you like this harp?|
55813|#822$#This is my most valuable possession.
#821$#Has its mysterious beauty bewitched you as well?|
55814|#822$#Do you like it too? It's made from my gold necklace.
#821$#It's priceless.
#824$#I paid dearly to get it.|
55815|#823$#I really like it. It's the thing I care about most!
#822$#It can bring a certain mystique to whomever carries it.
#821$#Carry it? Haha, don't you know that it's actually a necklace?!|
55816|#822$#Even the word "love" doesn't begin to express how much it means to me.
#821$#It... may even be more important than my own life...
#822$#When I have it... I feel as if I'm complete.|
55821|Tell me about your brother.|
55822|Who is your brother?|
55823|#821$#... La, la, la.
#822$#Yes? Sorry, I zoned out while playing the piano... What did you say?|
55824|#822$#... Why are you asking that all of a sudden?
#821$#I'm sorry, just thinking about him makes me feel very... agitated.
#822$#I don't think I can talk about him until my heart calms down...|
55825|#822$#My brother..? Why do you ask?
#824$#I hope you can focus more on me...|
55826|#822$#... I once hoped my brother would stop battling humans. Why couldn't he just stay with me?
#821$#So, I took his sword and hid it.
#824$#Even though my brother lost, he left me in the end.|
55831|Such beautiful clothes!|
55832|Tell me more about your outfit.|
55833|#821$#I'm happy that you like it, but I feel a little uncomfortable wearing it...
#824$#I want to change...
#823$#What's that? I really suits me? Then... I'll keep wearing it.|
55834|#821$#He once praised this outfit too...
#823$#I didn't expect that you two would have such similar taste. What an amazing discovery!|
55835|#822$#The ribbon on my head was a gift to me from my brother.
#821$#He said it matched my outfit. That's how he picked it out...
#823$#At that time, I really felt really happy.|
55836|#822$#This outfit makes it easier for me to play the harp.
#821$#That's the only reason I had it designed.
#823$#I added some of my own flower decorations to it. Do you like them?|
55841|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
55842|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
55843|#821$#... After a strange turn of events, I encountered Dante...
#822$#His appearance and height looked familiar, but he had a completely different temperament.
#824$#... When Sigrun told me they looked similar, I got kind of excited. I'm such a fool...|
55844|#821$#Ayako's collar looks so uncomfortable!
#824$#One time I tried to take it off, but Ayako said it was a gift from Master Odin... It can't be taken off.
#821$#Yes... Why is Master Odin so interested in it?|
55845|#824$#Even when Bealdor is silent, he has this air about him that makes me think about him.
#822$#... As soon as he speaks, though, I instantly forget about him.
#823$#Do you want to know who it is? It's you! Haha, just kidding...|
55846|#821$#I once spent time with Faust. I felt such admiration for his wealth of knowledge...
#823$#I felt as if our souls were connected.
#821$#Yes. Perhaps it's because I feel like he's similar to my ideal partner.|
55851|I've heard that you're very popular.|
55852|I heard you have many suitors.|
55853|#821$#... Yes. I'm lucky to be loved by so many.
#822$#If you feel this way too, I think... I'll feel even happier!
#823$#Why happier? B-because I like you a lot too!|
55854|#821$#... Being loved by so many is nice, but it's also very troubling.
#822$#Once there was this thief... He stole Snaipe's hammer!
#824$#What business is that of mine? Well that thief was one of my suitors!|
55855|#824$#... I just wanted him to pay attention to me. I hoped he would see only me...|
55856|#822$#But my heart already belongs to someone else.
#824$#They all work so hard to please me, but in the end the only thing I can say is "I'm sorry"...|
55861|I heard you have many treasures.|
55862|What is your most valued treasure?|
55863|#823$#My most valued treasure is my gold necklace.
#821$#It acts as jewelry, a musical instrument, and a weapon.
#822$#Yes? How can a necklace be a musical instrument or a weapon?
#823$#The harp that's in front of you is just one of its many possible shapes. It's form is malleable.|
55864|#821$#In addition to being a necklace, I also have an enchanted feather coat.
#822$#I wear it when I want to soar through the skies.
#823$#Want to try it on? How about next time? A friend already borrowed it a few days ago.|
55865|#822$#Treasure?
#821$#I think my headband is my most treasured item...
#823$#It was the first gift he gave me.|
55866|#822$#Oh, I have quite a bit! There's the gold necklace, the chariot, the coat...
#821$#But I really treasure my relationship with you as well!|
55871|Do you like animals?|
55872|What kind of animals do you like?|
55873|#822$#I like all animals, and they like me.
#821$#When I sing, they'll will surround me and listen to my music.|
55874|#822$#I think it must be a cat, because he...
#821$#Once he gave me a cat as a gift.|
55875|#822$#Of all animals, cats are my favorite.
#821$#I once raised two cats in my palace.
#823$#Want to know their names? They were Pookums and Snookums! Cute names, right?|
55876|#822$#I actually really like Yumikaze's pet, Ruffles.
#823$#I feel like an eagle when I put on my feather coat.
#821$#Hehe, Ruffles is a good friend of mine.|
55881|I heard that you once chose soldiers with Sigrun.|
55882|Then the soldiers who were chosen were qualified to enter your palace.|
55883|#822$#After the battle ended, Sigrun and I chose soldiers who we deemed worthy.
#821$#The souls of the chosen soldiers received invitations to enter my palace.
#823$#Why? Because their souls needed soothing in order to alleviate the pain that the war caused them...|
55884|#822$#Only a soldier who was truly fearless on the battlefield received a soul invitation.
#821$#But if their lovers chose to follow them... I invited them as well.
#823$#That way they could be reunited in the palace.|
55885|#822$#Since you asked... Do you want to go into my palace?
#821$#Well then, can you die bravely? Ha!|
55886|#822$#Sigrun will kiss the chosen soldiers and split them into two groups.
#821$#One group goes to Master Odin's hero chamber. The other group comes to me.|
55891|Have you thought about your life after we part ways?|
55892|What's your plan after we part ways?|
55893|#824$#So far... I haven't thought about this question...|
55894|#821$#If that day really does come,
#822$#I'll go back to the palace and wait for the day when I can see you again...|
55895|#822$#Perhaps I'll lose myself in my music once more...
#821$#It doesn't matter. I won't feel sorrowful leaving you.
#823$#Even if we had to separate, you're the most important person to me, aside from him.|
55896|#824$#Perhaps separation is a fate that can't be avoided.
#822$#I hope I can play a piece for you before we separate...
#821$#You are very important to me, so I'd want you to leave with a blessing for the future. May it always be bright.|
56001|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
56002|What do you do in your free time?|
56003|#823$#Master! Don't you know it's impolite to ask about a superstar's private life?|
56004|#821$#Hmm... reading, singing, and dancing!
#823$#Those are my favorites! It's a pretty standard set of leisure activities for a diva like me!|
56005|#821$#As long as I have the time, I practice my dance moves!
#822$#I often trip over Yates when practicing new moves...
#823$#Don't worry, though. On stage, my moves will never fail! You'll never see a more perfect performance!|
56006|#822$#It seems that Yates wants to say something... What? No, I never spy on master!
#824$#No way! I didn't! Bad Yates!|
56011|What about your combat skills?|
56012|Are you a good fighter?|
56013|#821$#When you're in combat, I'd be glad to play some music for you!
#823$#That way, you can take enemies out in no time! Yates and I will stay behind and support you!|
56014|#824$#I don't like fighting... Why can't everyone be nice and get along with each other?|
56015|#823$#I was born to sing, not fight!
#822$#Huh? What? Why can I still fight like other Eidolons? Err... I have no idea.|
56016|#823$#Because life is a battle! Master!
#824$#What? That's an old-fashioned saying? I actually say it a lot...|
56021|Is there anyone you have a crush on?|
56022|What sort of people do you like?|
56023|#824$#Of course not, master! You don't ask a singer something like that!
#823$#Hmm... I'd have to say people like you and Yates.|
56024|#823$#If you want to know the answer to that question, you'll have to purchase my next ten albums and become a VIP of my fan club first!|
56025|#821$#I like someone who's warm, gentle and strong...
#823$#Everyone should have a partner like that... And it just so happens that there's someone like that right here!
#824$#What? You say you don't know anyone like that? That's a shame...|
56026|#821$#There is actually someone that I care a lot about. I wouldn't call it a crush, though.
#822$#He helped me through some troubled times and guided me into the world of music!
#824$#Sadly, there's nothing I can do for him now, even though he's suffering...|
56031|You should have a concert!|
56032|When are you going to have a concert?|
56033|#823$#Everybody! Thank you for all your support! Thanks!
#824$#Huh... Hasn't the concert started yet? I'm sorry...|
56034|#822$#Cesela's concert? I'd better prepare a gift...
#823$What? My concert? Eh... Anyway, thank you all! I love you, too!|
56035|#821$#There's a lot of preparation involved in putting on a concert! Design, promotion, ticket sales, and a lot of other little details...
#824$#What? You say it's canceled? That's so unfair, master...|
56036|#824$#But... I don't know where I should perform now...
#822$#You want to hear me sing, no matter when and where? Really? That makes me so happy!
#823$#I'll perform a private concert just for you, master... I hope you enjoy it!|
56041|Do you like art?|
56042|What do you like about art?|
56043|#821$#Literature, painting, singing, instrumental music... I like them all!
#823$#Art enriches life, don't you think?|
56044|#821$#A good drama is always moving...
#823$#Don't you agree? I knew I was right about you, master!|
56045|#823$#Every form of existence is a work of art!
#821$#That's why I support every artist who commits themselves to their work!
#822$#They call me a goddess... of inspiration! Stop it, Yates! That's such an exaggeration!|
56046|#821$#It's true that artists often visit me...
#822$#They all say that my songs lift their spirits in times of frustration.
#823$#Nothing makes me happier than helping others!|
56051|Let's talk about some of the different races in this world.|
56052|Can you tell me about other races?|
56053|#822$#I've heard than the mermaids are excellent singers. I'd like to meet them someday... Huh? What?
#824$#You say there are no mermaids left in the world? Only the Sarpa? And they all look terrifying? Is that true? How sad...|
56054|#821$#Master, have you ever seen Alessa? It's said to be an Eidolon that soars through the sky!
#823$#How beautiful is that? I wish I had wings, too...
#824$#What? Alessa doesn't have wings?... How does she fly, then?|
56055|#821$#This world is still strange to me...
#823$#But if there are any places you'd like to visit, I'd be more than happy to go with you!|
56056|#824$#What? Other races? I don't know anything about them...|
56061|Where would you go if you had a vacation?|
56062|What is your favorite vacation destination?|
56063|#821$#Hmm... a singer like me has almost no time off. I actually have no idea...
#822$#What about Yates? Yates, where would you like to go?
#824$#Sunhunter's Vale? That place is swarming with dinosaurs! You'd get eaten alive...|
56064|#823$#I hear that sunbathing on the Helonia Coast is pretty popular!
#821$#Just imagine lying down in the warm sunshine... Wonderful!
#822$#Sorry... I was thinking about something else... I'm fine!|
56065|#822$#Why do you ask? Are you planning a trip?
#821$#There are plenty of places and things that I want to see! Like the Crescent Ceremony...
#824$#I still need to record my new album... Master, I don't think I can go with you...|
56066|#821$#Rumor has it that there's a plateau in Triatio Highlands where you can see all the stars at night.
#822$#Do you think that's a good idea, Yates? Master, will you go there with us?|
56071|Do you know anything about Pandemonium?|
56072|Do you have any info on Pandemonium?|
56073|#821$#Pandemonium? Loki? Do you mean THAT Loki?
#823$#No... I've never heard about it...|
56074|#821$#Not many people know about Pandemonium at all, but master, you even know the Lord of Demons' name! Impressive!
#824$#Err... No... What was I going to say? Something about Pandemonium?|
56075|#821$#This world consists of three realms: Aura Kingdom, Terra, and Pandemonium.
#822$#Pandemonium has been plotting to take over Terra, which is located in-between the other two realms. They want to use it as a strategic position to attack Aura Kingdom later.
#824$#What a headache... Why is Pandemonium behaving so aggressively? Why can't we all just get along?|
56076|#821$#The demons of Pandemonium often come to Terra via dimensional rifts. Why do they have to come here?
#822$#What? To come to my concerts? Really?
#824$#Master says that's not true! Quit joking around, Yates...|
56081|Do you like card duels?|
56082|Let's have a card duel!|
56083|#822$#Haha! I thought you'd never ask! Actually, I'm pretty good at it!
#823$#Trump card!|
56084|#823$#Heehee! I guess you could call me a pro!
#821$#Have you played against the Grand Bishop yet? The Abyssal decks are pretty hard to deal with!
#824$#You lost? Sorry! I didn't mean it...|
56085|#821$#Card duels are a great source of inspiration!
#823$#Next time you have a duel, I'll sing a song to support you!|
56086|#823$#Hm... Huh! My new piece is almost done... I only need you to lose one more duel!|
56091|What can you tell me about the Culinary Club?|
56092|Do you know about the Culinary Club?|
56093|#823$#You're interested in cooking? I want to learn how to cook!
#824$#Huh? You say the Culinary Club doesn't offer any cooking classes?|
56094|#821$#I've heard that the Culinary Club sometimes commissions special quests. I'd like to try one of them!
#824$#What? You say those quests are only for professional cooks? Aww...|
56095|#823$#It's said that the Culinary Club is headquartered right in Navea. I'd be more than happy to pay a visit!
#824$#What? Nothing special about it? Ah... I see...|
56096|#822$#What does the Culinary Club do? Why, they collect epic kitchenware and fight against the forces of culinary darkness, of course!
#824$#Huh... they don't? I'm sorry...|
56101|Are you a singer?|
56102|Is it true that you're a vocalist?|
56103|#823$#My name is Muse! Thank you for supporting me!
#821$#That pretty much sums it up... That's right! I'm a singer!|
56104|#821$#Yes! I love singing, and I have a lot of enthusiastic fans...
#823$#That pretty much makes me a singer, right?|
56105|#821$#That's right! Do you like singing too, master?
#823$#We should sing together at my next concert!|
56106|#821$#Yates is a vocalist, too! That is to say, we're actually a vocal group, right?
#822$#Anyway, we always perform together!|
56111|What's that little sprite with you?|
56112|The creature next to you¡Xwhat is it?|
56113|#821$#Yates is a good friend of mine!
#822$#Yates keeps me company and offers a lot of useful advice. He's a true friend!|
56114|#821$#During my concerts, Yates even transforms into powerful loudspeakers!
#822$#No matter where I sing, Yates makes sure that everyone can hear me.
#823$#Master, if you have a crush on someone, Yates might be able to help!|
56115|#822$#When Yates needs to rest, he just stays in my gemstone pendant!
#821$#Huh? What does he eat? Hmm... I've actually never seen him eating anything.|
56116|#822$#Yates says that tomorrow will be a good day... What? Can't you hear it, master?
#821$#Oh... It seems that I'm the only one who can hear Yates' voice!|
56121|What instrument do you play the best?|
56122|What kind of instruments do you play?|
56123|#823$#I like drums! They can give you an intense, punchy beat. A good drummer can evoke all kinds of emotions in the audience.
#821$#Do you want to see me play drums, master? Bring it on! You'll have to sing, though!|
56124|#821$#Actually, I play the harp, too!
#823$#Would you like to hear? I can play a piece of music for you!|
56125|#821$#In the end, I prefer singing!
#824$#No...? But... I love singing so much...|
56126|#821$#I can play all kinds of musical instruments!
#822$#How did I learn to play them? Hmm... I guess I was born with those skills.|
56131|You outfit is cute!|
56132|The gemstones on your outfit are beautiful!|
56133|#821$#Haha! This outfit was specially designed to maximize concert attendance! After all, I am a professional singer!
#823$#I'm happy that you like it too, master!|
56134|#823$#Thank you! Thanks for your support!
#824$#I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me... I really shouldn't talk to you like that... After all, you're my master, not a fan...|
56135|#823$#Thank you, master! Yates helped design this outfit. I like it a lot!|
56136|#821$#Master, have a look at these gemstones. They're the same color as Yates! Beautiful, aren't they?
#822$#Yates actually lives inside the stones.
#821$#Why does he live in the gemstones? Hmm... Maybe it's because he's a Gemstone Sprite...|
56141|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
56142|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
56143|#821$Ayako, Hansel, and Gretel occasionally invite me to join their tea party...
#824$All the finger foods are so delicious! I wonder why they never put on any weight...|
56144|#821$#Master, did you know that an Eidolon used to help me practice singing?
#823$#Can you guess which one?
#824$#Good guess! Master, you're so clever!|
56145|#821$#So, Cesela still doesn't want to join me?
#824$#I don't know why she's being so competitive. I just want to be friends... Why doesn't she like me?|
56146|#821$#Merrilee is like a little sister to me. We talk about our hair all the time...
#822$#What? Beautiful hair is very important to girls!|
56151|Do you have many suitors?|
56152|What do you usually do with your suitors?|
56153|#822$#Yates, what should we eat tonight?
#823$#What did you say, master? I couldn't hear you!|
56154|#823$#Thanks for your support, everyone! I love you, too!
#821$#I'd probably say something like that...
#822$#What does a real relationship feel like?|
56155|#822$#I like it when he chases me... Huh? What am I saying?
#823$#Never mind... Is my face turning red? I feel so hot all of a sudden...|
56156|#824$#Sometimes, my fans get overenthusiastic... I try not to let it bother me...
#823$#You say you'll protect me, master? Great! I knew you were the best!|
56161|What were you doing before your debut?|
56162|What did you do before you became a singer?|
56163|#822$#IT'S A SECRET! I won't ever tell anyone, even my master!|
56164|#824$#If you knew that I was a bad kid, would you still like me, master?|
56165|#823$#Let's just say that I like my current lifestyle better.|
56166|#824$#Those old days were pretty monotonous...
#822$#Now I have you and Yates... I'm really happy!|
56171|Why did you come to Terra?|
56172|What brought you to Terra?|
56173|#823$#I'm here to promote my new songs!
#822$#Of course, you'll get an exclusive, autographed copy, master.|
56174|#821$#I was always trying to cheer others up, but I never found anyone who could do the same for me.
#823$#Thankfully, I was able to find that person here!|
56175|#823$#I hope my songs can motivate everyone and bring you inspiration.
#821$#But here I've found a beautiful soul who encourages me to keep moving forward...
#822$#And who is that? Don't you know?|
56176|#823$#It's someone who helped me! He taught me how to sing and made me who I am.
#821$#I wanted to help him too, so I followed him to this world.
#824$#I hope that one day the light will shine upon him once more...|
56181|Are you always so cheerful?|
56182|Do you ever feel depressed?|
56183|#823$#A singer has to spread happiness and joy, so I've got to have a positive mindset!
#822$#You and Yates are always there for me. Even when I'm feeling sad, I know I'll be back to normal in no time!|
56184|#821$#Master, guess what! Happiness is contagious!
#823$#I want to bring a smile to everyone's face...|
56185|#821$#Of course I've had some bad times, but everybody does at some time or another. I think it's fine.
#823$#If you've had a tough day, I can sing a song to cheer you up!|
56186|#824$#My life was... unfortunate.
#821$#Luckily, I met someone who warmed my heart and taught me everything about music. I'm really glad it turned out the way it did.
#823$#Now, I want to spread joy and happiness with my own music!|
56191|Have you thought about what your life will be like after we part ways?|
56192|What's your plan for the future?|
56193|#821$#Even if we part ways, I'll continue to support you, master!
#822$#Though I don't want to be away from you, I would support your decision, master! But don't you think our fans would be upset?|
56194|#823$#No matter when or where, I'll always support you, master.
#821$#No need to worry about me, master. Just do whatever you want!|
56195|#821$#Perhaps I'll write some new songs...
#822$#I have a feeling I could write scores of songs about you, master!|
56196|#821$#Even if we part ways, I'll still be me. I'll continue to devote myself to music!
#822$#I would definitely feel lonely sometimes... But I won't let it get me down!
#823$#I would certainly invite you to my concerts as a special guest, master!|
56301|What makes you happy?|
56302|How do you define happiness?|
56303|#822$#Happiness comes from a place of satisfaction and fulfillment.
#823$#I hope I can bring you happiness, too, master.|
56304|#821$#Happiness is not having to get up early for work!|
56305|#821$#Shirayuki told me
#822$#that happiness is all a matter of mindset...
#823$#Are you unhappy, master? Why don't you let me cheer you up?|
56306|#822$#Even if something bad happens,
#823$#don't be discouraged. Everything passes with time!|
56311|What do you do in your free time?|
56312|Do you have any hobbies?|
56313|#823$#Does staying in bed in the morning count?
#822$#Huh? What's so great about staying in bed?
#821$#Well, where else would you want to sleep? Speaking of which, I'm feeling pretty sleepy right now...|
56314|#822$#I also like doing housework!
#823$#Having a clean room is so relaxing!
#821$#*Yawn* The only thing is... I'm always so tired after doing the cleaning...|
56315|#821$#*Yawn* If I'm not sleeping...
#822$#You'll probably find me cleaning or playing around with Orbie.|
56316|#823$#I find some pretty amazing things while cleaning the house.
#822$#I once spotted a bird nest on my roof!
#823$#You should try it too, master!|
56321|What's your favorite food?|
56322|What kind of food do you like?|
56323|#822$#I like senbei! Do you know what that is, master?
#825$#It's a type of delicious rice cracker.|
56324|#823$#I like both the sweet and the savory kinds!
#824$#Spicy food? No, I don't like spicy food.|
56325|#822$#I like candied fruit skewers. Don't you?
#823$#What? You've never had them?
#822$#How can that be? They're amazing!|
56326|#821$#*Yawn* Food?
#825$#Well, I definitely don't like soup...
#824$#Picky? What do you mean? Soup is always either too thin or too hot!|
56331|Which season do you like best?|
56332|What's your favorite season?|
56333|#822$#Of course I like winter!
#823$#Winter really highlights just how warm and comfortable it is in my bed.|
56334|#825$#Hmm... I like all seasons apart from summer...
#821$#Why? In summer, it's too hot to stay in bed!|
56335|#823$#Winter is my favorite season. Actually, I think autumn is pretty good, too.
#822$#What about you, master? Which season do you prefer?|
56336|#821$#Even though spring isn't the best season for staying in bed,
#822$#I do like the flowers that bloom everywhere.
#823$#Not bad at all!|
56341|Are you a good fighter?|
56342|Show me some moves!|
56343|#822$#I'm not the best at fighting,
#823$#but that doesn't mean I can't help you in battle!|
56344|#821$#Actually, I'd rather stay in bed and sleep than get in a fight...
#822$#But if you ask me for help, I'll do my best, master!|
56345|#824$#I don't like fighting...
#821$#*Yawn* I'm so... sleepy... Why don't you put down those weapons and take a nap with me?|
56346|#821$#*Yawn* Fighting? I don't want to get my clothes dirty...
#824$#Hmm... I really hate fighting, but sometimes there's no other option...|
56351|What do you think of Principia?|
56352|How do you like Principian culture?|
56353|#821$#*Yawn* The continent of Principia?
#825$#If there's no summer in Principia, I think I would like it very much!|
56354|#821$#*Yawn* You can only get there by airship.
#824$#Hmm... Airships are scary! I don't like them at all...|
56355|#821$#*Yawn* I'm tired... Good night, master...|
56356|#825$#I've heard that they have a very individualistic culture there!
#822$#I'm pretty independent myself, in case you were wondering.
#821$#*Yawn* I don't even need a bedtime story to... fall asleep... ZzzZzzz...|
56361|What do you think of Sunhunter's Vale?|
56362|Can you tell me anything about Sunhunter's Vale?|
56363|#821$#*Yawn* Huh? What did you say, master?|
56364|#821$#I have no idea... I don't get around much...
#825$#If you find that place interesting, why don't you visit? Don't forget to take me with you!|
56365|#822$#A vale? Sounds windy.
#823$#I'd better make sure I have enough blankets if we go there!|
56366|#821$#*Yawn* What? Did you say Desolate Valley?
#822$#Oh, no, I've never been there.|
56371|What do you think of Tanglevine Cascades?|
56372|Can you tell me anything about Tanglevine Cascades?|
56373|#822$#Tanglevine Cascades? It's a pretty cool place.
#824$#Sometimes it's a little too humid... My blanket gets sopping wet in no time!|
56374|#821$#*Yawn* There's a marsh in Tanglevine Cascades. It's a sure way to get your clothes dirty beyond all hope!
#825$#Last time I was there, I just ran through and got home as cleanly as I could.|
56375|#823$#I've also seen a lot of crystal balls in the forest. They're so beautiful!
#824$#Too bad that they're so big and heavy. I would have taken some home by now if I could!|
56376|#821$#*Yawn* I remember that there's a huge...
#825$#What are those things called? Hmm... a reservoir?|
56381|Can you tell me about the housing system?|
56382|Do you know about the housing system?|
56383|#825$#You mean your home, right? Do you already have a housekeeper?
#822$#If not, I'd be glad to do the job!
#823$#Your house will always be spotless on my watch!|
56384|#822$#You can put all kinds of furniture in your house.
#823$#If I were you, I'd make sure there's more than one bed.
#821$#*Yawn* That way, I can sleep whenever and wherever I want...|
56385|#825$#Your house... sounds like a safe, cozy place...
#821$#*Yawn* I'm getting sleepy again...|
56386|#822$#I like your yard and your lawn!
#823$#It would be even better if you had some flowers.
#822$#Master, you like flowers too, don't you?|
56391|Can you teach me about the Sky Tower?|
56392|Do you know anything about the Sky Tower?|
56393|#821$#The Sky Tower... is too high for me...
#824$#It scares me silly! I would never go there!|
56394|#825$#I've never actually been in the tower.
#822$#I've heard that it's loaded with treasure, though.
#821$#Even though I'm curious, I still don't want to go there.|
56395|#825$#Hmm... It seems that the Sky Tower keeps records of past adventures.
#822$#If you want to go there to write your own history...
#823$#I'll just wait for you outside. Be sure to tell me all about your daring deeds when you get back!|
56396|#821$#*Yawn* I've never been there. I have no idea.
#822$#You should ask Eternia. She knows everything!
#821$#*Yawn* Maybe I'll just take a nap while you're gone...|
56401|Your temari ball has a beautiful pattern!|
56402|Can you tell me about your temari ball?|
56403|#822$#Orbie has a pretty cute pattern, right?
#823$#Oh, that's my temari ball's name¡XOrbie!|
56404|#822$#My temari ball skills are out of this world!
#823$#It's easy when your weapon is your soulmate.|
56405|#822$#I love the natural beauty of the world's plants,
#823$#so I tried to make Orbie's patterns as colorful as theirs.|
56406|#822$#Sometimes I look for inspiration from the flowers.
#823$#Why? Because I want Orbie to be even more beautiful, of course!
#822$#Master, look! I designed all these patterns myself.|
56411|What are you doing?|
56412|Are you hiding something?|
56413|#822$#Huh? No, I'm not hiding anything...
#823$#Okay, you got me. There actually is something! Here, have a look!|
56414|#822$#Huh? It's nothing...
#825$#I was just eating some dessert.
#823$#Hehe! Do you want some, master?|
56415|#822$#What do you mean?
#823$#I'm not hiding anything...|
56416|#822$#Master! Look behind you! A huge rice cracker!
#824$#Hmm... it didn't work...|
56421|Do you communicate with other Eidolons?|
56422|I want to know about the other Eidolons.|
56423|#821$#*Yawn* One time, Yumikaze and Ruffles came to visit me.
#822$#I was lying in bed under the blanket, and they could only see my face.
#824$#Ruffles thought I was a monster! It was so embarrassing...|
56424|#822$#Hmm... The way that Ayako looked at Orbie was weird...
#825$#She looked like a starving wolf!
#821$#*Yawn*... Maybe she thought Orbie was a huge piece of candy.|
56425|#821$#*Yawn*... Uriel looks energetic every day.
#824$#I'm sure he always gets enough sleep...|
56426|#821$#*Yawn*... Once I accidentally fell asleep on Eternia's shoulder...
#822$#When I woke up, I asked my sister how long I had slept.
#821$#She told me that the passage of time is an illusion. What do you suppose that means?|
56431|You seem really sleepy.|
56432|Are you tired?|
56433|#821$#*Yawn* It's just... I kind of want to sleep...
#825$#I used to sleep twelve hours a day.
#821$#Zzzzz... I get too little sleep these days. I'm still not used to it...|
56434|#825$#Zzzzz... Rice crackers are so yummy...
#824$#Ah, I was falling asleep...
#821$#What? Did I talk in my sleep? I don't believe it!|
56435|#825$#Eh? Do I look tired?
#821$#That's probably because I only slept for eight hours last night...|
56436|#821$#Master, you look tired, too.
#822$#You didn't sleep much either, did you?|
56441|Where would you like to live?|
56442|What does home mean to you?|
56443|#822$#I like places that are warm...
#823$#and cozy!|
56444|#821$#*Yawn* Those big, luxurious houses make me really uneasy.
#822$#It's so difficult to keep everything clean and tidy in a big house!|
56445|#822$#I'd much rather live
#823$#in a small cottage in the countryside.|
56446|#821$#*Yawn*... Home is where you feel warm and relaxed...
#822$#What more do you need?
#821$#*Yawn* I'm getting tired again...|
56451|I've heard that you can bring good luck.|
56452|Is it true that you're a symbol of happiness?|
56453|#825$#Everyone says my smile can bring happiness...
#822$#But that's true of everyone, isn't it?
#823$#Master, you should smile more often!|
56454|#823$#You can be symbol of happiness for me, too!|
56455|#821$#*Yawn* I'm not quite sure, but...
#823$#I think if everyone else is happy, I'll be happy, too.|
56456|#825$#Having enough food is also a way to reach true happiness. Don't believe me?
#822$#Just look at Ayako!|
56461|Your mask is very special.|
56462|Can you tell me about your mask?|
56463|#822$#Cute, isn't it?
#823$#I like its eyes the most!|
56464|#823$#I really cherish this fox mask...
#822$#Because it's a gift from a friend!|
56465|#822$#Master, do you want to try it on?
#823$#You would look awesome!|
56466|#822$#Some people seem to be afraid of it.
#823$#I don't know why. I can't think of anything cuter!
#825$#What do you think, master?|
56471|Do you like to sing?|
56472|Can you sing a song for me?|
56473|#823$#Shall I sing a nursery rhyme for you?
#822$#What do you think?|
56474|#822$#Would you clap along, please?
#823$#Master, sing along with me!|
56475|#822$#Master, are you good at singing?
#823$#Okay, you go first! Heehee...|
56476|#822$#Back in my hometown, I often sang songs with my friends and danced in a circle.
#821$#*Yawn*... It's a lot of fun, but also very exhausting...|
56481|Is there anything that scares you?|
56482|What are you afraid of?|
56483|#821$#*Yawn*... I'm most afraid of waking up alone.
#823$#But because you're here with me, I'm not afraid anymore!|
56484|#822$#I'm not afraid of anything!
#824$#My fear of heights? Okay, I guess that counts as one.|
56485|#821$Hmm... Is there anything that you're afraid of, master?
#822$#If you're ever scared, just let me know, and I'll protect you!|
56486|#821$#I can't stand a dirty room...
#824$#So much dust and dirt... Disgusting! Horrifying!
#824$#If you live in that kind of environment, you'll get sick for sure!|
56491|Have you thought about what your life will be like after we part ways?|
56492|What's your plan for the future?|
56493|#822$#As long as I get to travel with you,
#821$#I won't mind sleeping a little less...
#822$#Please don't talk like that, master...|
56494|#821$#*Yawn*... Huh? Did you just ask me something?
#822$#Sorry, I didn't hear you!|
56495|#821$#Why would you ask me that? Are you unhappy that I sleep so much?
#822$#I'm sorry! I won't do it again... Look! My mind is clear!|
56496|#824$#Hmm... I'm not going anywhere!|
56601|What's your favorite food?|
56602|What do you normally eat?|
56603|#823$#Everything! I'm not a picky eater. I eat anything as long as it tastes good!
#824$#Bitter melon? I don't like bitter food.|
56604|#822$#I used to like apples!
#821$#And strawberries!
#823$#Do you want to buy some for me?|
56605|#821$#Apples? Well, one time some old women offered me an apple.
#823$#I took one bite out of it and immediately fell asleep. Then I had some of the best dreams of my life! I felt like I was floating between worlds.
#824$#But after I woke up, my whole body hurt!|
56606|#822$#Apples, I guess!
#823$#You can call me an apple expert!
#821$#If you're interested, just ask me!|
56611|Do you like animals?|
56612|What kind of animals do you like?|
56613|#822$#I like birds. Especially those small, adorable ones.
#823$#Why? Because they can fly! I wish I could fly, too.|
56614|#823$#All furry animals adorable!
#821$#For example? Hmm... like Mr. Bear!
#822$#Don't you think Mr. Bear is very lovely? I think he's great.|
56615|#823$#I love small animals! Squirrels, sparrows, and lots of others!
#821$#When I was taking care of my friends' house, the animals often came to play with me!|
56616|#821$#I also like horses, particularly white ones.
#823$#I guess it's because I remember a prince on white horse from somewhere. Maybe a dream?
#822$#Do you happen to have a white horse, Master? I would be thrilled if we could ride together!|
56621|Types of people that you like?|
56622|What qualities are you looking for in a partner?|
56623|#821$#Well! I've given LOTS of thought to that.
#824$#Hmm... where to start? There's just so much!|
56624|#822$#He should be gentle, kind, and a good cook who has a graduate degree in making apple pies. What else?
#823$#He should be an excellent rider! That way we can talk long, horseback rides on the beach. Do you know how to ride a horse?|
56625|#821$#He must be someone gentle and handsome, who dresses immaculately¡Xthat is a must!
#822$#Are you trying to set me up with someone?
#824$#But I already have you!|
56626|#822$#Hmm? Why would you ask me something like that? Just go look into a mirror.
#821$#You don't get it? My prince... is you!
#823$#You are the one that I like the most in this world!|
56631|What do you think is the most incredible thing in the world?|
56632|What's the most marvelous experience you've had?|
56633|#824$#Hmm... hmm... That's a tough question! Hmmmmmm! I'm thinking! Hmmmm!|
56634|#822$#I love jogging through the forests. I used to do it all the time.
#821$#Sometimes, as I passed by humid spots, the air would condense and freeze into small snow flakes!
#823$#So if I ran around an area for a while, the whole place would become covered in snow! It's as amazing as it sounds!|
56635|#823$#I often think it's a miracle that I met you instead of someone else.
#821$#Life is strange but also full of surprises!|
56636|#821$#Once I ate something that made me very tired and I fell asleep.
#822$#I dreamt that I was wandering through the forest, making friends with the animals...
#823$#I even stumbled upon a house made of candy! How awesome, right?|
56641|If you could make one wish come true, what would it be?|
56642|What is your greatest wish?|
56643|#823$#My greatest wish is to be with you forever, Master.
#821$#Do you think it might come true?|
56644|#821$#I think most people wish for someone with whom they can spend their entire lives with.
#822$#I'm just like them. That's my greatest wish, too.|
56645|#823$#I wish I could get married with my prince charming and live a happy life.|
56646|#823$#My wish is to find my prince charming.
#822$#Who will be my prince? Hmm... Well, I don't know either.
#823$#But he should be someone who treats me as gently and kindly as you do, Master.|
56651|Have there been any recent events?|
56652|Are there any special quests we can go on?|
56653|#822$#Have you seen those places marked with a star on your map?
#821$#If we go check them out, we might find something interesting to do.|
56654|#823$#I love events! What kind of events we are going to participate in?
#824$#No? Hmm... sorry, I misunderstood.|
56655|#824$#Hmm? What did you say, Master? I didn't hear you!|
56656|#824$#I don't know much about stuff like that.
#822$#Why don't you go ask a Mirabelle Association Clerk? They'll certainly know more about that.|
56661|Have you been the City of Navea yet?|
56662|Heard of Navea?|
56663|#824$#I'm not so sure... Perhaps I was there once?|
56664|#822$#City of Navea? Is it a castle?
#823$#It sounds like a scared fortress! I really want to go there with you, Master.
#821$#What about it? Let's pay Navea a visit right now! What do you think?|
56665|#822$#I'm not sure. But it seems to be a very lively place.
#821$#Master! You're willing to go there with me?
#823$#Thank you, Master! I'm sure I'll be able to buy some awesome presents for my friends!|
56666|#822$#I've never been there. But the animals in the forest have told me about it.
#823$#They also told me that Navea is a city of delectable sweets like Floating White Stars and Frosted Macaroons.
#824$#*Gulp* Master... I'm hungry. Could you make me an apple pie?|
56671|What do you think of Principia?|
56672|How do you like Principian culture?|
56673|#821$#Principia? Is that somewhere fun?
#823$#Are you saying you'll take me on a journey there? That makes me so happy!|
56674|#824$#I don't have an impression of it. Is it somewhere well-known?|
56675|#821$#It sounds like somewhere far, far away. Do we need special transportation to get there?
#823$#Like... maybe an airship?! I've been DYING to travel on an airship!|
56676|#821$#I've heard that they have a very individualist culture!
#823$#If that's the case, I don't know if I'll get along with them. I rely on my Master a lot!
#822$#What about you, Master?|
56681|Do you have your own Guardian Knight?|
56682|Do you know of the Guardian Knights?|
56683|#822$#That's a relationship only mortals can share.
#821$#I wonder if that kind of bond can be established between a human and an Eidolon.|
56684|#821$#It links two hearts. Hearts belonging to people who have vowed to protect each other!
#822$#As the relationship develops, they may even get married and host a magnificent wedding!
#823$#I wish that you could also be my Guardian Knight, Master. I hope that we can stay together forever!|
56685|#823$#Of course, my Guardian Knight will and can only be you, Master!|
56686|#821$#It's a strong bond between people, just like the one between us.
#822$#Huh? Eidolons can't become Guardian Knights?
#824$#But... I want to be able to marry you, Master. We should fight for our rights!|
56691|I want to know more about archaeology.|
56692|What can you tell me about Archaeology?|
56693|#823$#Archaeology? Do you mean a Treasure Hunt? I'd like to dig up some treasures, too!
#822$#The ancient must have left behind tons of treasure! |
56694|#821$#Eternia once mentioned the Relic Collectors in City of Navea.
#822$#If you find rare relics, you can trade them with the Relic Collectors for a small fortune!|
56695|#821$#I've heard that you can trade the relics you've found for tokens that can be exchanged for other items.
#824$#Such as... apple pies! You can't? No way!|
56696|#821$#Archaeologists devote themselves to discovering traces of their ancestors.
#822$#It's a discipline where exploration and history intersect.
#824$#But... I hated history when I was in school. I don't even like reading.|
56701|Do you like books?|
56702|What kind of books do you like to read?|
56703|#824$#Hmm... I like neither books nor reading.|
56704|#821$#My nanny used to say that a princess must be educated, so I should read a lot.
#824$#But all the books she gave me were filled with long paragraphs and my eyes hurt when I read too much.|
56705|#823$#But I love fairy tales! I love those! And picture books!
#822$#What about you, Master? What kind of books do you read?|
56706|#821$#I like stories, fairy tales, and comics. I heard that in a remote land, there's another kind of book called manga. I'd love to read one!
#823$#I especially like stories with happy endings, like those where the beautiful maiden ends up with a dashing prince.|
56711|Who's your queen mother?|
56712|Can you tell me about your queen mother?|
56713|#824$#Sorry, Master. Could we not talk about her?|
56714|#821$#She used to be really good to me.
#822$#But after she came to possess that magic mirror... well, she seemed to stop liking me.
#824$#I don't understand why.|
56715|#824$#I actually liked my queen mother a lot... really a lot.|
56716|#822$#Huh? What was your question, Master?
#821$#I couldn't hear you very well. Would you say it again, please?|
56721|Do you know about the magic mirror?|
56722|I heard that there's a magic mirror.|
56723|#821$#Magic mirror? My queen mother had one.
#824$#But... But I hate it! There's nothing I hate more!|
56724|#821$#Do you need a mirror? 
#822$#My mirror is in my room. I don't think that'll be very useful to you. |
56725|#821$#Magic mirror? Do you mean the one my queen mother possesses? 
#824$#But... It's broken... Would another mirror do?|
56726|#821$#Huh? What did you say, Master?
#822$#I've never heard of anything like that.|
56731|I heard that you're friends with the seven dwarves?|
56732|Have anything to share about the seven dwarves?|
56733|#821$#So, you know about them too, Master.
#823$#They are all very kind and good friends of mine.|
56734|#822$#They've treated my gently, and never blamed me for my mistakes.
#821$#Once I ate their dinner and slept in one of their beds,
#823$#but they didn't get mad at me.|
56735|#821$#They get up early every morning for work.
#822$#Sometimes I would help them prepare breakfast.
#823$#They always ate everything I made and told me it was delicious, even when I was pretty sure it wasn't.|
56736|#821$#My dwarf friends like apple pies a lot, too.
#822$#I remember the last time I baked them pies...
#823$#They cried! It was so touching.|
56741|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
56742|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
56743|#821$#Did you know? Rumor has it that Muse already has someone she likes.
#824$#I wonder what he's like. Hmm... I have no idea...
#822$#He's probably a mysterious figure.|
56744|#821$#I was once invited to a secret band practice.
#822$#Cesela had a beautiful voice and Uriel played the guitar in a way I had never heard before.
#824$#However, Fenrir couldn't really find the rhythm. Maybe she's not so good at drums after all.|
56745|#821$#Although Alucard is much older than I am, we talk like equals.
#823$#Why? Because he's also looking for his destined one.
#822$#I'd like to meet my destined one, too.|
56746|#821$#I heard that Harmonia has two cats, and they have beautiful names!
#824$#They're called... Hmm... I can't remember...
#823$#Right! Pookums and Snookums! They're just the cutest! Aren't their names amazing?|
56751|Tell me about that staff of yours.|
56752|Your staff looks special.|
56753|#823$#Hah! It's a gift from my father.
#821$#I polish it every day! It's clean as a whistle.|
56754|#823$#What do you think about it? Isn't it beautiful? I made the ornamentations myself!|
56755|#822$#The ruby atop the staff imitates the shape and color of an apple.
#823$#If you sniff closely, you'll even pick up an apple fragrance. Mmm!
#821$#Isn't that fantastic, Master?|
56756|#821$#The butterfly decoration duplicates the design of the wings on my back.
#823$#They are made from a concentrated form of my magic. When the sun shines on them, they glimmer like a prism.
#822$#If you would like to take a closer look, I can let you borrow it briefly.|
56761|I heard that people with a big forehead have good luck.|
56762|You have a big forehead.|
56763|#824$#But I don't have one! You do! Booooo...|
56764|#824$#You're so mean, Master. I hate when people point out my forehead... I don't want to talk to you anymore!|
56765|#821$#Alice once said that a big forehead is a symbol of good luck.
#822$#But I don't actually believe in luck and fortune. I don't need either!
#823$#As long as I have you, I'm happy.|
56766|#822$#Huh? What did you say, Master? I don't know anything special about foreheads.|
56771|Do you like to exercise?|
56772|Do you play any sports?|
56773|#824$#I don't like sports... I get scared when I have to dodge and always end up running away...|
56774|#823$#I'm good at climbing trees! Especially apple trees.
#824$#But... every time I got caught by nanny, she'd rebuke me... She said that it's not something a princess should do.
#821$#Why girls are not allowed to climb trees, Master?|
56775|#821$#Hmm... Does jogging or running count?
#822$#I'm actually quite a good runner!
#824$#Because... I had to run away from nanny all the time... Never mind! You didn't hear anything! La la la la!|
56776|#821$#Tree climbing and jogging!
#822$#I'm actually very flexible. Do not underestimate me, Master.|
56781|What is a kiss of true love?|
56782|What does a kiss of true love mean?|
56783|#822$#A kiss of true love means that two people care for each other more than themselves.|
56784|#821$#In every story I've read, a kiss of true love prevails over any challenge!
#822$#I'd like to know how it feels to be kissed that way.
#821$#What about you, Master? Do you know what it's like?|
56785|#823$#It's a kiss with the power to lift curses.
#824$#You say it's not true? Well, I believe in it! You should be more romantic, Master!|
56786|#821$#The kiss will only lift a curse when the two people truly like each other.
#823$#I hope a person like that exists for me, too.|
56791|If there comes a day where we have to part ways...|
56792|What would you do with your life if you left?|
56793|#824$#I don't want to talk about this...|
56794|#822$#I... I... *sniff*... I guess I would return to my father's castle...
#821$#And there I would wait for until the day you return for me , Master.|
56795|#822$#Master... Where would you go? Is it somewhere dangerous?
#821$#If so, I would never leave you alone, Master.
#823$#I would stay by your side for the rest of eternity.|
56796|#822$#I would first return to my father's castle to see him. Then, I would visit my dwarf friends.
#823$#I would be able to introduce you to them when you come pick me up!
#821$#I'm sure you'll all get along!|
56901|What's your favorite quote?|
56902|Do you have a motto?|
56903| #822$#¡KHave you heard of "curiosity killed the cat"?|
56904|#822$#"Hmmm... I don't have that!
#821$#Strength and practice! That's what's important.|
56905|#822$# If I do say so myself...
#821$# "Being better than yesterday" makes a lot of sense.|
56906|#822$#If you have the time for this, why don't you continue training? #821$#Your own strength is much more reliable than some wise man's motto.|
56911|Do you have any strengths?|
56912|Special research?|
56913|#821$#Isnt't it just combat? #822$#What... Combat Maniac! How rude! I am the One-Handed God of War, Tyr!|
56914|#821$#Listen, I'm the One-Handed God of War, Tyr. I represent power. #822$#Then you must be good in combat?|
56915|#821$#Well, I occasionally work on recipes ... After all, Fenrir...
#822$#What's that look? Is it so strange that the God of War can cook?|
56916|#822$#Silly! There's nothing else worth the time to study except combat. #821$#Forget about it. I got some new recipes. I need to read them.|
56921|Is there someone you like?|
56922|Types of people that you like?|
56923|#821$#I believe I have the physical strength and the courageous heart, necessary of a hero. #824$#What? Didn't I answer your question? I'm confused...|
56924|#823$#Powerful people are very attractive! #821$#Isn't that what you asked? Wouldn't you like to have the appearance you want?|
56925|#821$#For romantic purposes? #824$#Well, the One-Handed God of War stands for power. Nothing else is as important.|
56926|#821$# Romantic, well... I haven't thought about it...
#821$# But... isn't it easier than being alone...?|
56931|Really cute!|
56932|Tyr is so cute!|
56933|#821$# How rude! I am the One-Handed God of War Tyr! #822$# The name is a symbol of power. Don't call me cute!|
56934|#824$# Hei...Height doesn't mean anything! #821$# I am the one-handed War of God! This is the strongest name that symbolizes power! #822$#That is to say, power is the most important quality!|
56935|#822$#¡KHeight doesn't matter at all! Not cute! #824$#Well...Everyone wants to be taller...|
56936|#821$#¡KYou can keep your compliment. #824$# What... what? What? Do I have something on my face?|
56941|What are your thoughts on family?|
56942|What does family mean to you?|
56943|#824$#¡KYou! Can't you come up with a better question?|
56944|#821$# Cherish your family. #824$#Families support you no matter what.|
56945|#824$#¡KFor me, there is only "Clan", which is a looser association. #821$# If the Clan thinks it's good, then everyone thinks it's good. #821$# I suppose if you follow the will of the Clan, everyone will be satisfied.|
56946|#821$#I heard men are very weak when they're born. They need to be protected by parents. #822$# But I was born with enough power to be independent,
#824$# so... that's probably why I don't exactly have any family.|
56951|There have been a lot of demons turning up recently.|
56952|Demons attacking the human world...|
56953|#822$#Huh, those little demons...
#823$# Allow me, the One-Handed God of War Tyr, to get rid of them!|
56954|#822$#Huh, I think of them as the quite powerful. You are not afraid of those inferior demons, are you?|
56955|#822$# Pathetic demons with no self-consciousness.
#821$#They are merely the pawns of the Demon King. No need to worry about them.|
56956|#821$#What? Are you worried? #822$#Didn't you bring everyone together? Then trust your friend. #821$# Huh? This is not to comfort you. You did well.|
56961|Do you want to go somewhere?|
56962|Let's hang out!|
56963|#822$# What are you talking about? I don't have time to hang out! #821$# In order to live up to my name, I have to practice in every free moment.|
56964|#821$# Huh? Hang out? #824$#¡KHow does such an idle guy have such impressive power...|
56965|#821$#Places to go... well...
#822$#I heard Triatio Highlands is quite a tough place, with giants and birdmen...
#821$#Maybe it's a good place to practice... Hey, hey, where are you going?|
56966|#822$#Great! I heard Ventos Prairie has fierce lions. Let's go fight them! #823$#In the name of the One-Handed God of War, I will bring glorious victory in the name of my family!|
56971|Have you heard of the Ministry of Magic?|
56972|Rumor says The Church runs the Ministry of Magic!|
56973|#821$#Oh, any special research in your Ministry? #822$#Huh? Is it strange that I study magic? #823$# Being the One-Handed God of War, I must train both physically and spiritually to reach excellence.|
56974|#821$# Do humans practice physical and spiritual training separately? #822$# Well, there aren't many elites that can master both like I do.|
56975|#824$# Practicing magic rather than training your physique doesn't make you truly strong! #821$# You are not weak, are you?|
56976| But....

56981|About leveling...|
56982|If you want to level...|
56983|#824$#If you want information, ask the casting expert. I'm not interested. #821$# I am the One-Handed God of War. I don't need tricks like this.|
56984|#821$# Collect the same weapon and armor sets and you will increase your level.
#822$# The higher the levels are, the more powerful the result is. #824$# Well... You people have invented many ways of being stronger.|
56985|#821$# Remeber, if leveling with ratings, the weapons acting as the materials will disappear. #822$# How do I know this? Well, nothing in the world can beat the One-Handed God of War!|
56986|#821$# Leveling weapons can increase attack. #822$# Leveling armor can increase XP¡K
#821$# Want to give it a try? I believe you are the strong one. You can't lose.|
56991|Method to enhance strength?|
56992|I really want to become stronger...|
56993|#821$# If you see a blue exclamation mark on the map, it means there is a request from the residents. #822$# If you have the time to talk nonsense, why don't you work on yourself and help others?|
56994|#821$# Walk around and see if anyone needs help. #822$# If you talk to the locals, they will have requests for you.|
56995|#821$# You are growing by helping others, aren't you?  #822$# Instead of wasting time here, go and see if anyone needs help.|
56996|#821$# I have been training alone. #821$# As for you, people will be delighted to have you helping them, right? #822$# Why are you still here? Go to confirm the blue exclamation marks on the map!|
57001|I heard you are named One-Handed God of War?|
57002|What's the One-Handed God of War?|
57003|#821$# It's not just me. The One-Handed God of War is a title passed down from generation to generation within the family. #822$# The title represents power incarnate. It is only given to the strongest fighter. #824$# I inherited the title. So I must be the strongest.|
57004|#823$# Ok, listen, One-Handed God of War is power, is the strongest fighter! #824$# If I deem you to be strong, you can't be too weak, understand?|
57005|#822$# Well, One-Handed God of War represents the absolute power. #821$# Huh? Why does "one-handed" God of War have two hands? #822$# Ignorant! This is a title passed down from my elders. It is only given to the strongest fighter.|
57006|#822$# One-Handed God of War represents power. This is a title passed down from my elders. #824$# Each God of War is a respectable fighter... I want to be one of them.|
57011|What's the matter between you and Fenrir?|
57012|Do you know Fenrir?|
57013|#822$#¡KWhere is this coming from? If you haveso much time to ask questions, why don't you go train?|
57014|#822$# Where did you get that idea? Fenrir... I have nothing to do with him! #823$# I just happen to know him! Nothing more! Listen, I have nothing to do with him!|
57015|#821$#... It's just unfortunate coincidence! That's just the family order. We grew up together...
#822$# Anyway, we don't have a close connection. Don't get it twisted!|
57016|#821$# It's just that he's a biter. No one else dares to get close except me...
#822$# Then why do you look like you're full of expectation?|
57021|Is something the matter with the bandage on your arm?|
57022|Is there something special about it?|
57023|#824$#¡KMind your own business. My hands are fine.|
57024|#822$# What? Are you going to bite me?|
57025|#824$# Huh, if some day I release my power completely, I won't be needing this.|
57026|#821$#¡KThis is a barrier. #824$# Power from the family... I will be able to handle it one day.|
57031|You talk about your family a lot.|
57032|Tell me something about your family.|
57033|#822$# Well, I'm from a noble family. You are all peasants to me! #824$# Fen...Fenrir... He is different.|
57034|#821$# My familiy is the top influence in my world.
#822$# Being a member of the family is a glorious honor.|
57035|#821$# My family has produced rulers and brave fighters from far and wide.
#822$# Granted with the title of the one-handed War of God, I cannot be a disgrace.|
57036|#821$# I come from a long line of rulers. Noble blood runs through my veins. #822$#  Maintaining justice and order is the family's responsibility.
#821$# That's why I'm working so hard!|
57041|I would like to know the secrets of other Eidolon.|
57042|Tell me some interesting gossip about Eidolons.|
57043|#824$# Not gonna happen. I'm not interested in other Eidolons. #822$# No one can outclass the nobility and power of the One-Handed God of War!|
57044|#822$# You... probably haven't seen Fenrir angry. #821$# I have seen it once when I almost died from a heart attack...
#824$#... Anyway, I don't want to see him angry again...|
57045|#822$# Huh! Bealdor is not worthy of being You know the Bringer of Light! #821$# Being dumped by a woman, how ridiculous! Wow, I look so handsome after my power is released¡K
#824$# ¡KWell, not to me! I'm not jealous!|
57046|#821$# So, the so-called "Eidolons" are from different worlds? #822$# Some of whom are strong, like the Fallen Angel, the Dragon...
#823$# If we have the chance to compete, they will know who is stronger!|
57051|What's your weapon?|
57052|What a special weapon!|
57053|#821$# Oh? You are quite right. I built it myself! #824$#¡KWhat are you looking at? I'm not building one for you!|
57054|# 822 $ # This is the weapon for the God of War. Most people can't handle it. #821$#¡K Want to take a look? Well... Fenrir is the only one who has touched it before... If you want to, it's not impossible...
#822$# What's that look? Stop looking at me like that or I'm not loaning it to you!|
57055|#822$# Oh, you noticed!
#821$# You can switch it for a sword and a gun to deal with both close and long distance combat...
#823$# How's that? Pretty badass, huh?|
57056|#821$# Well, don't be jealous. Everyone has his own attack mode. #824$# I know someone who's great with bare hands... man, he can bite!|
57061|How do you enhance your strength?|
57062|How?|
57063|#821$# No one has the magic pill for you. You can only depend on yourself.|
57064|#821$# Constant training, of course. #822$# Hard? What are you talking about? Training is a must! #821$# The one who inherits the title of One-Handed God of War must possess the equivalent power.|
57065|#821$# Unlike humans, I have been able to run and wield weapons since the moment I was born. #822$#From then until today I have been training.|
57066|#821$# I've done it alone.
#822$# But combat experience from fighting with others can also be very helpful. #824$#¡K I'm not thankful for Fenrir practicing with me.|
57071|Hair color ...|
57072|When fighting ...?|
57073|#821$# Huh? My hair will change color? What are you talking about?
#822$# You must be mistaken!|
57074|#821$# Eh... My hair changes color when I fight? #822$# You are not the first who has said that... No! It can't be true...|
57075|#821$# Speaking of which, when I concentrate during battle, I can feel it happening...
#824$# But hair color variation is the power of the legendary first God of War, why would I...|
57076|#821$# My hair changes color during combat? How come Fenrir never mentioned it before? #822$# Not fighting hard enough? What are you talking about! It is even an insult to your opponent if you are not fighting hard enough during the battle! #824$# Afraid to hurt him... What are you talking about? How... I...|
57081|Did you smell it?|
57082|It smells great...|
57083|#822$# Wow! You surprised me... with this smell you keep talking about...
#821$# For a second I thought Fenrir is coming¡K|
57084|#821$#¡K Did Fenrir do something to you? #822$# I don't smell! For Christ's sake, it's an insult to my name!|
57085|#821$#¡K The biscuit in the pocket is not for you. #822$# Why do you have this? No, it's not specially prepared! #821$# Stop asking... Here, have one! Stop asking!|
57086|#821$# Huh? Probably biscuits. #822$# Where's it from? Well, I don't know! You can have it if you want.|
57091|If we have to say goodbye some day.|
57092|What's your plan afterwards?|
57093|#822$#Huh? Are you kidding? I am the One-Handed God of War! #821$# Me wanting to stay with you is the best thing that could happen to you! #824$# What's bothering you? Cut to the chase if there are any problems!|
57094|#822$# Think about why I'm staying here. Do you really want to leave me? #821$# If you didn't mean that, I'm not saying I will leave. Stop saying stupid things!|
57095|#822$#¡K I won't stop fighting anyway. If you want, it's up to you. #824$# However, don't forget that I think of you as the strong one.|
57096|#821$# Where are all those silly things coming from? Have I ever disappointed you? #822$#I don't think so. I heard it's the thing for other Eidolons. Is this what he's worrying about? #824$# My... My Lord! All right!|
57201|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
57202|What do you do to kill time?|
57203|#821$#Do you hear Dante's voice? And see the way he walks?
#823$#Oh, Dante...he's so dreamy!|
57204|#822$#Why am I telling you about this?
#821$#This is...personal. Are... Are you kidding?
#823$#..... Even if you try to bribe me with promises about my Dante... I... I won't do it!|
57205|#825$#I think there's a smudge on Lord Dante's photo. Let me just...there!
#823$#Wow. What a beautiful picture of Dante!
#821$#Oh, if only he'd look at me the way he looks in that photo...|
57206|#823$#Of course I listen to Dante! His every wish is my command!|
57211|What's your favorite food?|
57212|What do you normally eat?|
57213|#824$#Me? No, I don't need food. Blurp...
#822$#I'm not hungry at all. No... No way...
#821$#What a little gossip you are! Well, if you insist on giving me food, I guess it would be rude not to take it!|
57214|#823$#As long as Dante is here, that's all the sustenance I need.|
57215|#822$# Wait... What's that face? You brought me... Strawberry...cake?
#824$#N-Nevermind what I said before about food! I... I didn't say anything! Hmph!|
57216|#825$#Try this wine. It's the Beaujolais Nouveau that Dante mentioned before.
#823$#Smooth, with subtle fruity undertones...
#825$#Oh, I should have known Dante would have exquisite taste!|
57221|What are friends?|
57222|What does friendship mean to you?|
57223|#824$#A...friend? Who needs them? Lassie's the only friend I need.
#823$# ... You're saying you are my friend? Don't even... That's not funny! You're just a servant!|
57224|#822$#Friends are something weaklings need to make themselves feel loved.
#824$#But I don't need that! As long as Dante is here... I... I don't need anyone else!|
57225|#824$#Friends... They'll always leave you in the end!
#822$#... They don't understand what loyalty means...but my Lassie does!|
57226|#822$#You know... Lassie's my only real friend.
#821$#She's always been here for me. Even when everyone else has left...Lassie's always been here.
#824$#... You... Would you stay with me, too?|
57231|What are your strengths?|
57232|Any hobbies or skills?|
57233|#821$#I find the combination of magic and machines fascinating.
#822$#Like my bag, for instance! You see, it's powered by the-
#824$#... If I'm boring you, just be honest with me. I hate it when people lie to be polite!|
57234|#821$#I can't let them threaten Dante.
#822$#When they try to get close to them, I'll...I'll shoot them from behind!
#823$#It's for their own good. I'll let them know that Dante is untouchable!|
57235|#821$#Oh, nothing much. Just reading.
#822$#What kind of books? Well, let me see... "10 Perfect Love Potions," "How to Win His Heart"...
#823$#Eternia recommended them to me. They're very, um, interesting reading.|
57236|#825$#Of course it's Dante!|
57241|Types of people that you like?|
57242|What qualities are you looking for in a partner?|
57243|#822$#Strong, brave, handsome...someone just like Dante.
#825$#Oh... But no one else could ever compare to Dante himself.|
57244|#822$#Don't look at me like that! My heart belongs to Dante alone!
#823$#If you proposed to me, you'd only be embarrassing yourself. I could never accept.|
57245|#824$# What? H-Hopefully someone committed. I've had enough of break-ups. I don't know if I could take another.|
57246|#825$#Of course, everyone loves Dante. Who wouldn't? He's so powerful and clever...
#821$#Sometimes it makes my heart race just to think about him!
#823$#If I could go on a date with him, just one date, I would die happy!|
57251|Have you heard about the Demon Spear?|
57252|Tell me more about this Demon Spear.|
57253|#821$#Demon Spear? Of course! Weapons like that are my specialty!
#822$#The Demon Spear is especially versatile.|
57254|#821$#It's a close-quarters weapon imbued with arcane powers. Hm... But if I had to pick my favorite part, it would be the seals.
#822$#Special seals grant it the ability to unleash different ultimate strikes.
#823$#Like attacking with a dozen different spears instead of just one! Pretty cool, right?|
57255|#822$#The more you use the Demon Spear, the more seals you'll build up.
#821$#Once you have enough seals, you can lash out with different Ultimate Strikes in countless combinations.
#823$# ... Do you want to learn how to use them? Hah! You'll have to try harder than that!|
57256|#824$# What's that? All these questions are making me sleepy. Let's talk more some other time.|
57261|What do you know about the Quests?|
57262|Tell me about the Quests.|
57263|#821$#Well, they're things you do to help people in need.
#822$#Finish their quests, and people will give you a reward.|
57264|#821$#I've heard of a group called Miyol that gathers quests from all over the place.
#822$#If you want to make a name for yourself, you should go do some quests from them!|
57265|#822$#I have better things to do than help people with their little problems.
#821$#But if they're offering a reward, it might be worth your time.
#824$#Why don't you go help them?|
57266|#821$#Not everyone is as powerful as they'd like to be. We can't always solve our problems by ourselves.
#822$#That's why there are organizations like this to put those with problems in touch with people who can solve them.
#824$#Heh, humans really do think of the most clever things.|
57271|Do you know about Magic Division?|
57272|What is the Magic Division?|
57273|#821$#That human magic place? It sounds intriguing.
#822$#I'd love to know what secrets it holds. Or where they get their magical energy...
#823$#Servant! Put "Visit the Magic Division" on my to-do list!|
57274|#821$#The basic idea is to train your mind to sense the ebbs and flows of energy around you.
#823$#How exciting! The details are more complicated, but they offer so many potential applications!|
57275|#821$#Those human mages don't seem very strong...
#824$#You aren't like them, are you?
#824$#I won't have a weakling for my servant!|
57276|#822$#I've heard they know a lot about ancient ruins. Some rumors say they can control time itself.
#824$# Personally, if you ask me, I'd go back in time and...
#821$#W-Wait, did I say that out loud? Nevermind! It's none of your business! It happened a long time ago, anyways.|
57281|Can you tell me about the housing system?|
57282|What is the housing system?|
57283|#824$#Um...don't you have a house? Did you forget how to get back to it?
#822$#Could be memory loss. I've heard that sometimes a smack on the head can jog your memory-
#823$#Here, let me help you! Hahaha!|
57284|#822$#You remember how to fish, right?
#824$#Hm. That's strange. And yet you don't know how your own house works? Do you just never go home?
#821$#Your house must be terribly dusty. How gross!|
57285|#822$#You can tell a lot about someone from their home. Their taste in furniture, the color scheme...
#823$#I hope your house is nice. I don't want people thinking I have a servant with bad taste!|
57286|#824$# What? My home? After everything that's happened, I don't have a home any more. But I don't need one, either!|
57291|Can you fish?|
57292|Dou you know how to fish?|
57293|#823$#Of course! Anyone can fish!
#824$#Why don't you just try it instead of bothering me?|
57294|#821$#It's unbelievably simple. Just throw a fishing pole in the water and the fish will swim right up to it.
#822$#A-At least that's how it always works for me!|
57295|#822$#There's an old quote that says, "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."
#821$#So if you don't want to be hungry, pick up your fishing pole and go figure it out!|
57296|#821$#If you really want to fish, I know places where the biggest, rarest fish hide!
#823$#If you can catch them, I bet they have all kinds of trinkets in their bellies.|
57301|That box looks very special.|
57302|Can you tell me something about your box?|
57303|#823$#Well of course it's special! This is my personal weapon?
#821$#What weapon? It can turn into an axe!
#824$#Performance? Ha! You're the one who's supposed to entertain me, not the other way around!|
57304|#823$#Hmm, you have good taste!
#822$#It's actually made from my own design.
#823$#Do you see those carvings on it? Those help it transform!|
57305|#823$#Of course it's special! I made it with Justinia's help!
#821$#I traced those carvings myself, imbued them with magic and blood...
#823$#So I'm the only one who can activate them! You might say it's made for me!|
57306|#821$#This is my most prized possession.
#822$#Everything I care about is inside it. Well...almost everything.
#823$#As long as I have it with me, I feel safe.|
57311|About the Magic Box...|
57312|I heard you opened the Magic Box?|
57313|#824$#Huh? W-What Magic Box? I... I don't know what you're talking about...|
57314|#824$# What? Who told you that? I'd better go shut their mouth!|
57315|#824$#... I was just curious what was inside! I didn't think it would hurt anything...
#822$#But when I woke up, in that darkness... Everything around me was dead.
#824$#... Everyone turned their backs on me after that. No one would accept me. Dante was the only one to offer me a home...|
57316|#824$#...I don't want to talk about this any more.|
57321|The relationship between you and Dante|
57322|How do you know Dante?|
57323|#824$#How dare you address Dante that way? You aren't worthy of calling him by his name!
#823$#That's LORD Dante to you!|
57324|#822$#Ever since the day Dante saved me, he's been my one and only master.
#823$#I won't allow anyone to disrespect him. Do you understand me?
#825$#Dante is mine. Mine!|
57325|#825$#I'll never forget the day that I met him.
#I thought my life was over, that I'd be alone forever. And then he saved me.
#825$#Oh, Lord Dante...I owe him everything that I have.|
57326|#824$# What? Y-You'd be grateful, too, if he saved you from the situation I was in!
#822$#He means the world to me.
#823$#Any enemy of Dante's is an enemy of mine! I'd do anything for him!|
57331|About your dog|
57332|Can you tell me something about your dog?|
57333|#821$#Her name is Lassie. She's clever, and loyal, and fierce!
#823$#Show her a trick once and she'll remember it like that!
#822$#And she remember my enemies, too... Hehehe...|
57334|#822$#Hah! Lassie is my soulmate!
#823$#She doesn't have any patience for people I don't like.
#821$#So you'd better treat me nicely!|
57335|#822$#Lassie's more than just a pet. She's my friend, my confidant.
#821$#We have a special connection. I suppose, in a way, you and I have a connection, too...
#823$#That's why I let you be my servant! You really should thank me.|
57336|#821$#I found Lassie wandering the streets when I was young.
#824$#... To be honest, she almost died because of me.
#823$#I begged Dante to save her, and in his generosity, he did.
#825$#Oh, Dante! You see why I love him so much?|
57341|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
57342|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
57343|#821$#When Eternia met Diao Chan, she got a book about Dante.
#822$#She told me it was a fun read... But it was all about Dante and that Fire Angel!
#824$#Hmph! What junk! Everyone knows Dante belongs to me!|
57344|#821$#Tyr isn't as honest as everyone thinks.
#824$#He always admired Bealdor, but he never said anything about it.
#823$#He should take a page out of my book!|
57345|#821$#Muse has got a soft spot for someone! It's someone with dark skin and a smile as warm as the sun...
#822$#Muse said it's someone who always keeps their promises. Someone I know...
#824$#Weird... I don't think I know anyone like that? You? Darn. I was hoping you would know.|
57346|#824$#Lord Dante always seemed to care about that Fire Angel.
#821$#He's always talking about him... Maybe she wants to take him away?
#824$#If it'll make Dante sad, I can't let that happen! Servant, I order you to help me fix this!|
57351|Do you know Prometheus?|
57352|Tell me about Prometheus.|
57353|#822$# Planning on replacing me already? Prometheus?
#821$#I've never met him myself. I've only heard about him from his brother.
#822$#Apparently he's super smart!|
57354|#821$#I heard he made fire as a gift to Azuria. That's kind of impressive, I guess, but...
#824$#Isn't the Cube much more efficient than building a fire?
#822$#Great minds think strange thoughts, huh. Don't you agree?|
57355|#821$#I guess he's the forefather of all humans.
#822$#The Cube of Gaia would probably like that.
#821$#Maybe he has some connection to it!|
57356|#824$# What's that? I thought I heard you say something. Well, if you have something to say, don't mutter about it!|
57361|About the Fire God|
57362|Do you know anything about the Fire God?|
57363|#824$#He's...my foster dad. And barely even that. He barely even looked at me. Never gave me a smile.
#822$#I tried so hard to make him proud. But I think he only took me in because Grandpa ordered him to.
#824$# What? It's true. Sometimes I wonder if I'd be alive if Grandpa hadn't ordered him to take care of me.|
57364|#821$#What a little gossip you are! You've probably heard of my foster-father before.
#822$#He's a famous smith, known all across the world.
#823$#He made these himself out of the purest gold. He's talented, I can't deny that.|
57365|#821$#... He was never as good-looking as his brothers. Some people called him ugly.
#822$#But he was always so gentle with the things he made...
#824$#He was patient like that. Even though his mother never cared for him, he still loved her...|
57366|#821$#One of his legs never worked quite right. 
#822$#I heard one of his parents dropped him when he was little, bu the never blamed them. This one time Grandpa had a splitting headache, my dad even cured it for him.
#823$#I...really used to admire him, when I was younger.|
57371|What's this eye pattern?|
57372|What does the hexagram mean?|
57373|#825$#This symbolizes the commitment between Dante and me!
#823$#It's proof that I'm his soulmate.
#824$#No one else can ever take him away from me!|
57374|#822$#The hexagram is one of Dante's marks.
#821$#Come to think of it, since you're my servant, that makes you Dante's servant, too!
#823$#You're lucky to work for such a powerful lord!|
57375|#825$#I keep it to remind me of how much Dante has done for me. 
#821$#When I'd lost everything, almost lost my powers...
#823$#It was Dante who gave me a second chance. He gave me a reason to live.|
57376|#823$#Anything with this hexagon on it has a connection to Dante.
#825$#This sigil links it to his soul.
#825$#That means that no matter where he is, I can always feel his presence.|
57381|You're so pretty!|
57382|Your outfit is very fashionable.|
57383|#821$#Oh, well, I based it on the kind of things Dante likes.
#822$#Between his taste and my fashion expertise, of course it's a beautiful outfit!|
57384|#823$#I never knew you had such good taste!
#822$#Do you see these roses? I pick them from my garden every morning to wear.
#823$#In a way, they're a lot like me. Beautiful, but full of thorns...|
57385|#823$#Even when you're born as beautiful as I am, it's important to take care of yourself.
#821$#Keeping your hair hydrated with rose oils, applying lotion to your skin...
#824$#But no matter what I do, my hair's always so thin and straggly. It gets tangled every time there's a hint of a breeze. I can't stand it...|
57386|#823$#Dante likes this outfit too, you know!
#821$#He never said anything about it, but I saw him smile at me.
#823$#He must've been so overcome by its beauty that he couldn't find the words!|
57391|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
57392|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
57393|#824$#What do you think you're doing?! As my servant, you're not allowed to leave without my permission!|
57394|#821$#... Does this mean you're already thinking about abandoning me?
#824$#W-Why would you want to leave? Is it because I called you my servant?
#824$#Well... You're more than just a servant. You're my friend. I...I don't want you to leave.|
57395|#821$#... I guess if you left I'd keep traveling with my Lassie. 
#824$#I haven't had anywhere to call home in a very long time.|
57396|#821$#I'll go back to Dante and tell him all about you!
#822$#There's a chance he might be angry...
#823$#But don't worry! I'll tell him to forgive you.|
57501|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
57502|What do you do to kill time?|
57503|#822$#Ohhh, I just love sunbathing!
#823$#If you came with me, I'd love it even more!|
57504|#821$#And I always love playing wtih you.
#823$#Master! Hey, Master! Do you want to play right now?|
57505|#823$#Master, look! Look at this tiny bug I caught all by myself!
#821$#W-What's wrong? Don't you like it?
#824$#I-I'm sorry, Master... I'll throw it away... Please don't be mad...|
57506|#822$#Time flies by whenever I'm brushing my hair.
#823$# What's that? Your hair is messy, too? Let me help you comb it!|
57511|Is there anything in particular that you just can't stand?|
57512|Is there anything you don't like?|
57513|#824$#Hm... I don't like it when you're away from me! Please, Master, you should keep me with you all the time!|
57514|#824$#I guess I don't like rainy days, either. They make my hair all messy. It's such a pain to untangle it!
#822$#Although people say it's romantic to walk in the rain.
#823$#Is that true? Then I want to walk in the rain, too! I'll wear something warm so I don't get sick!|
57515|#821$#I guess I like... Basically everything. What about Master? Is there anything Master dislikes?
#824$#O-Oh. Really? Then... I don't like that stuff either!|
57516|#822$#... Nothing... Nothing to dislike...
#821$#What's that? Water? Water with cucumbers?
#824$#T-That sounds awful! I don't want any!|
57521|What kind of things do you like?|
57522|Is there anything that you like?|
57523|#821$#Umm...I like things I can play with!
#823$#Oh! What's that? What are you holding?|
57524|#823$#Fluffy balls and cat toys with bells that jingle and-
#821$# What? Me, a cat?
#824$#H-Hey! That's so rude! I'm not a cat... I'm a tiger! A big, fearsome tiger!|
57525|#823$#And I like Master, of course! Master is the best human ever!
#821$#Do I like you more than cat toys? Well, those are different from humans. I can't really compare them...
#824$#N-No, Master! Don't be sad! I love you more than anything!|
57526|#823$#Bells are fun too, though. They're bright and shiny, like...
#821$# Oh! Here. No! Master, don't worry! You're the best!
#824$#I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. I didn't mean to. Please forgive me!|
57531|Do you like to travel?|
57532|What are your opinions on traveling?|
57533|#822$#Tra...vel... Traveling? D-Do you like to travel, Master?
#821$#Oh, of course! I like it, too! Sniff... Are we t-traveling somewhere now?|
57534|#824$#I'm fine! I don't hate traveling at all!
#821$#I would follow my Master anywhere!|
57535|#822$#I'm a tiger, after all. Tigers aren't afraid of anything!
#821$#Just say the word, Master, and I'll be ready to hit the road!|
57536|#821$#I should tell you, Master, that I've never traveled by myself.
#824$#Being in strange places all alone is kind of scary.
#824$#I hope you don't think I'm a scaredy cat...|
57541|Let's fight together!|
57542|Are you a good fighter?|
57543|#824$#Are you saying you want to fight me?
#824$#No, Master! You're supposed to protect me!|
57544|#822$# Why are you asking? What did I do? I don't want to fight you!
#821$#But if you're ever in danger, I'll... I'll fight for you! No matter what!
#824$# What? You don't think I'm strong enough?
#824$#I'm sorry, Master... I'll try to work harder!|
57545|#821$#There are lots of things I'm good at!
#823$#Climbing trees, playing fetch...
#824$# What's that? Fighting? That's a tough question! I...I'm good at that, too, though! I... At least I think so...|
57546|#821$#... Do you want a fierce fighter by your side?
#822$#I can be fierce! Really!
#824$#Master? Why are you walking away? Sob... I guess I'm not ready...|
57551|What do you think about the Chronology Forest?|
57552|Can you tell me something about the Chronology Forest?|
57553|#822$#Well, I've heard that it's huge! Surrounded by this big field.
#821$#It kind of sounds like my hometown. There was a big field and lots of trees there, too!|
57554|#823$#Hmm, what else...I think there's a bunch of water in the middle, and some old ruin!
#821$#Why? Do you want to visit it?
#824$#Oh! Then take me with you, Master!|
57555|#822$#People also say there are a lot of strange Crystal Souls there.
#821$#Hm... I wonder how long they've been there?|
57556|#821$#They say that time stops in that place. I wonder if it's true?
#822$#If I go with you...
#823$#Maybe time will stop while we're together.|
57561|What do you think of the Tempest Desert?|
57562|Can you tell me something about the Tempest Desert?|
57563|#821$#It sounds awfully dry and sandy.
#822$#Somewhere like that will make my hair all dry, too! It sounds gross...
#824$#Do you want to go there?|
57564|#822$#The wind will blow all that sand in my hair!
#824$#It'll take ages to get it out. I don't want to see me all messy like that...|
57565|#821$#I heard there are humans fighting there, too.
#824$#Do you have to go there, Master? I don't want my Master getting hurt!|
57566|#821$#Looks like that village is... hmm...
#824$#It's completely overrun with soldiers! Kitami is not afraid!
#824$#Kitami will work hard to protect Master. Just stick with Kitami!|
57571|Do you know about the Demon Spear?|
57572|Tell me about the Demon Spear.|
57573|#821$#I don't know much... You really want to know about it? Then let me think...|
57574|#822$#Oh! Well, there is one thing.
#821$#Pandora's supposed to be interested in weapons like that.
#824$#I could try to find out more... B-But I'd have to ask Pandora. She's always got that nasty dog with her!|
57575|#821$#If she's interested in it, it has to be a magical weapon. I bet it's powerful! Do you want it?
#823$#I could protect you better if I had a weapon like that! Right?
#823$#I'll keep training hard!|
57576|#821$#I promise you'll be proud of me!
#824$#Even if I don't have a cool weapon like that... You'll stay with me anyways, won't you?|
57581|Can you tell me about the Pet System?|
57582|What is the Pet System?|
57583|#822$#P-Pet? What pet?
#821$#Isn't a pet a creature that hangs out with their Master?
#824$#Oh... Are you saying I'm a pet? Sob... I'm not a pet!|
57584|#822$#W-Why? Did you want a pet? I'm really good at, um, catching things! Just watch!
#821$#... But... There's nothing here to catch...|
57585|#821$#I've heard that some of those little pets can turn gold!
#823$#Do you want me to be shiny like that?
#824$# What's that? No! I told you, I'm not a pet!|
57586|#822$#They've got all this magical power...not like me.
#821$#S-Sniff... I have my own kinds of power, though!
#824$#I can be just as strong as they are!|
57591|What is Eidolon purification?|
57592|I heard something about Eidolon purification. Do you know what it is?|
57593|#822$#It's a blessing that the Cube of Gaia can bestow.
#821$#I don't know how it works, though...
#824$#Sorry, Master... I wish I knew more.|
57594|#824$#D-Do you want to purify me? What's wrong with the way I am now?|
57595|#824$#If you want to purify someone, you should purify, um... Vermilion!
#821$#Yeah! Right! Vermilion definitely needs a bath!|
57596|#822$#Are you trying to change me as a favor?
#824$#That's nice, but if I change... I won't be me any more.|
57601|Do you think I look weak?|
57602|Why?|
57603|#821$#I-I'm not weak, Master!
#824$#Strangers are just...kind of scary.
#824$#Don't laugh at me! You're so mean...|
57604|#824$#I just like to be careful! If that makes me a coward...fine!|
57605|#822$# What's that? What did you say?
#824$#No, I really didn't hear you. Don't ignore me...|
57606|#821$#When I'm with you, nothing is scary. I'm not afraid at all!
#824$#...What? Sound? I didn't hear a sound! Sob... Master... Don't tease me like that...|
57611|Do you like to look at the stars?|
57612|Have you ever been star gazing?|
57613|#821$#The sky is so pretty on clear nights.
Do you like to look at the stars, too? Then... Do you like me, too?|
57614|#823$#The stars are always so sparkly. It's like they want me to play with them!
#824$# But... They're always too far away.
#824$#Sigh... Could you catch one for me?|
57615|#823$#It's easy to see the stars in my hometown.
#821$#You should come see them someday, too!
#823$#The stars will be even prettier if I'm with you!|
57616|#822$#One of our elders used to say that there's a star up there for every person...
#821$#And that I'm a constellation! Are you a constellation, too?
#824$#O-Oh... No? Then I'd rather just be a star, like you!|
57621|What is your weapon?|
57622|Tell me about your weapon.|
57623|#821$#This? It's a family heirloom.
#823$#Do you like it?|
57624|#821$#Look, Master! Isn't it neat?
#824$# What? I would never hurt you!|
57625|#821$#This is a family tradition. Hm...
#822$#I don't really understand it, but I know it's important.
#823$#Like you! Traditions and Master are both worth preserving!|
57626|#821$#I have to protect you!
#824$#H-Hey! That's not true! I didn't hide behind you! Well...m-maybe a few times...|
57631|Where do you come from?|
57632|Where do you live?|
57633|#821$#I...I don't remember.
#824$#Is that silly? I'm sorry, Master.
#824$#I... I've never had a good memory. It's not my fault...|
57634|#822$#I do know that my home was really far away!
#821$#Hm... How far? Umm...
#824$#Really far! That's all I know...|
57635|#823$#I remember there was a big field.
#822$#It had a big tree in the middle that I used to sleep under.
#821$# What's that? Where? It's in my hometown.|
57636|#824$#I... I can't remember how to get there...
#821$#But if I ever smelled that field again, I'd know I was home.|
57641|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
57642|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
57643|#821$#I feel like I've known Vermilion forever! Unbelievable!
#822$#Hm... I always feel like there's someone else there...|
57644|#821$#Uriel is always flying around in the sky.
#823$#It looks like fun. If I could fly, I could take you with me!|
57645|#824$#Ayako always stares at me. It's kind of creepy...
#821$#Hm... And I always see Tyr hanging out around Ayako.|
57646|#821$#All of Muse's concerts are always sold out! Do you like music?
#823$#Meow, meow...how do you like my song?|
57651|My hair?|
57652|It's soft!|
57653|#823$#Do you like it? I like you, too!|
57654|#821$#My hair was another color when I was born.
#822$#But after a long, long time, it turned that way.
#824$#Faded? No, it's not fading! Don't say that...|
57655|#821$#I groom it every single day-
#824$#Oh no! There's a tangle here! Y-You didn't see it, right?|
57656|#821$#It's nice when you pat my head.
#823$#It's...comforting! Thanks, Master!|
57661|What do you think about the seasons?|
57662|What's your favorite season?|
57663|#821$#I hate summer... It's so humid!
#824$#It always makes my hair all puffy. I need to look nice for my Master!|
57664|#822$#Spring is pretty, but... With all those flowers... It makes my nose- A-A-Achoo!
#824$#S-Sniff... Where did you go?|
57665|#823$#Autumn's my favorite! It's so breezy and peaceful.
#821$#Do you like autumn, too?|
57666|#821$#Someone once told me... That autumn would be a special season for me.
#823$#Oh! But don't worry! It's not as special as you!|
57671|Have you heard of the Four Holy Beasts?|
57672|What do you know about the Four Holy Beasts?|
57673|#822$#I heard about them when I was little.
#821$# What's that? Aren't they just a bedtime story?|
57674|#821$#All I heard is that the Four Holy Beasts guard something important.
#824$#What is it? Sob... If I don't know... Will you be mad?|
57675|#821$#The chief back home always said that power was passed on to those who were strong enough. I never understood what it meant.
#824$#What's wrong? Why are you staring at me? Sob... Is there something on my face?|
57676|#824$#Um... I'm not sure...
#821$#But there's a huge tiger statue in my hometown!
#822$#The chief said there are other statues like it in three other places.|
57681|Are you familiar with the God of Battle?|
57682|What do you know about the God of Battle?|
57683|#822$#Is that a god who likes to fight? He doesn't sound very nice...
#821$#W-Wait! Nevermind! I never said that!|
57684|#821$#God of Battle? Are you talking about me?
#822$#Y-You have the wrong person! The only things I know how to fight are yarn and cat toys...|
57685|#822$#Fighting doesn't sound like fun... I'd rather play with my toys.
#821$#I just want to stay with Master!|
57686|#821$#Sob... I don't like fighting... People get hurt when they fight!
#824$# But... For Master, I'll fight if I have to!|
57691|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
57692|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
57693|#824$#Don't say things like that!
#824$#I don't want to leave Master... Not ever!|
57694|#824$#I've never thought about it...
#821$#I'll follow Master wherever you go! You can't abandon me!|
57695|#824$#I don't know what to say.
#824$#I don't want to leave you... What if you forget me?
#824$#I would hate being alone. Master... I want to stay with you.|
57696|#824$# Master... Do you not want me any more? I don't like talking about this! P-Please, Master!
#824$#I'll train hard! Just don't leave me!|
57801|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
57802|What do you do to kill time?|
57803|#821$#Ugh! I wonder what Slimes usually do...
#823$#If I am studying Slimes? Hehe, let me tell you a secret. I am actually a Slime myself!|
57804|#823$#I love bling!
#821$#The buttons on your shirt for example. I think they're really cute!|
57805|#823$#I love blue! Like the blue of the ocean or the blue of the sky.
#822$#Did you know that the ocean and the sky are actually a couple?
#823$#They try to be as blue as possible to be closer to each other! Isn't that romantic?|
57806|#822$#I love places where you can find loads of books, like libraries or doctor's offices!
#821$#It's always funny when you open them and tiny people start jumping out from the pages!
#823$#I can introduce you to them if you ever want to meet them!|
57811|Do you like animals?|
57812|What kind of animals do you like?|
57813|#821$#I don't know if you know this but little bunnies actually have a pair of cute tiny wings!
#822$#They used to fly around the sky happily!
#825$#Apparently they stopped at some point... Hmm, perhaps they became too shy to do it.|
57814|#824$#Master... I feel sad...
#824$#My little fish... It left me...|
57815|#822$#It would be nice to be a little birdie... They fly around freely, apparently without a care in the world.
#821$#What if a fish and a bird were to fall in love?
#825$#I wonder if that bird would feel lonely.|
57816|#823$#I have the utmost respect for you!
#824$#Everyone else however...
#825$#They just want to capture me... I really hate that!|
57821|Do you like to travel?|
57822|Opinion about Traveling|
57823|#823$#No place is inaccessible to me in this world!
#822$#As a Slime, it is normal for me to appear anywhere!|
57824|#821$#My older sisters used to tell stories about their travels...
#822$#Like how someone once made a deal with a witch to trade their voice for feet so they could meet a prince...
#824$#Hmm... I don't understand why do you need to trade your voice for that. You just have to transform and presto! You have feet!|
57825|#821$#Feel the wind on your face! It clears the mind and gives you a boost!
#822$#Try to relax please. Breathe...
#823$#Zzzzz... Urgh... I just fell asleep...|
57826|#821$#Just one more step and the world is your mollusc!
#825$#Ugh... Unfortunately walking is very tiring... I hate walking...|
57831|What's my specialty?|
57832|Anything that I really apply myself to?|
57833|#822$#There is a bird that never stops flying until it passes away.
#821$#It only touches land when its lifeforce is finally spent.
#825$#Maybe... Maybe that will be my future...|
57834|#821$#My sisters told me that girls' tears can be used as a weapon.
#822$#I don't know if I believe that but I'll keep it in mind if I find some onions!
#823$#I'll even test it out on you!|
57835|#821$#If you want to sing you gotta use the diaphragm!
#822$#Come on, try it out! Inhale deeply and... SING!|
57836|#821$#With a huff and a puff I am... Connecting!
#822$#Whew. Connecting to Gaia is exhausting...
#821$#Am I doing it right? I am just fine! Neither fever nor cold can stop this eidolon from doing her thing!|
57841|How are you feeling?|
57842|Your opinion about love|
57843|#821$#I knew I'd become your Eidolon from the first time I laid eyes on you!
#822$#The way we connected was absolutely electrifying!
#825$#Did you not see that? Oh... It makes me sad that you don't feel the same way...|
57844|#821$#Lumikki once told me that her dream was to find Prince Charming
#822$#and that they would then live happily ever after!
#823$#Maybe Lumikki and I could be good friends!|
57845|#821$#Love? I think that when two souls connect they
#822$#eventually merge and finally blend into one. Forever and ever... And ever!|
57846|#821$#Some people, as long as they are with the right person, will feel very happy indeed!
#822$#I am very happy to be able to be with you!|
57851|What do you know about Magic spears?|
57852|Tell me about Magic spears.|
57853|#821$#My father has one of his own!
#824$#It's a long and mighty weapon.
#823$#Father can throw it like a shuriken... So perhaps it is a shuriken!|
57854|#822$#Do you by any chance know what my weapon is?
#823$#Go on, guess! If you get it right I'll show it to you!
#825$#Water? What... How... Ugh... I still don't know what to perform...|
57855|#821$#Magic spears? if they are magical shouldn't they be weapons for sorcerers?
#825$#So, not for a sorcerer but for a spearman? What exactly is the difference?|
57856|#821$#That's quite the spear! Is that the Duchess Victory?
#822$#You must have known that's the name of Astraea's weapon!|
57861|Is there anything you particularly like?|
57862|Where would you like to go?|
57863|#822$#Do you know the first rule of having a Slime?
#823$#You don't talk about having a slime... Just kidding! Water it always, that's the rule. It'll die without the necessary amount of water.|
57864|#821$#A fish out of water leaves its lifeblood behind and faces death.
#823$#I am exactly the same.
#824$#I will only stay with you, no one else. Likewise you can only have me with you!|
57865|#822$#The world is unimaginably big but I just want to be with you, forever and ever...|
57866|#821$#Mountains, water, flowers, grass, fish but weirdly enough, no sun.
#823$#The dream I had yesterday had a view like that!|
57871|Do you know what the Cube of Gaia is?|
57872|What's the Cube of Gaia?|
57873|#821$#That looks like my father. Do you know anything about my father?
#822$#He may look like a merman, but he's actually the Slime tribe's leader!
#823$#Father might not admit to it, but you can see it in his face. He's just shy!|
57874|#821$#Just like this world's father created and then destroyed it...
#822$#Why would he even do that? Hmm, it is an unimaginable power after all...
#824$#Just like you! If that sort of power isn't used properly it could destroy the world!|
57875|#821$#God? The one who created the world? Even the Sarpa Tribes' Secret Treasure was created by him!|
57876|#822$#You would like to know about Him?
#821$#Then I'm sorry, but you're barking up the wrong tree! He won't just answer anyone you know!|
57881|What is Eidolon purification?|
57882|I heard something about Eidolon purification. Do you know what it is?|
57883|#821$#Purification? Do you feel like I need a wash or something?"
#823$#Hm, I have been wanting to try out watersports. Teehee!|
57884|#822$#Well, if that's what you want.
#825$#I guess it doesn't hurt to give it a try... I'm kinda pain-averse you know?|
57885|#823$#I love being clean! After all, I have always been immersed in water so dirtiness is usually not an issue!|
57886|#821$#Are you an alchemist? So... Not really?
#823$#Why would you ask me that? An alchemist is good at transmuting, right?|
57891|Ever gone fishing?|
57892|Do you even know how to fish?|
57893|#822$#Fish? They weren't always waterborne creatures.
#821$#Why? Didn't you know this? Because...
#823$#Once upon a time water was air and vice versa. They should have never separated!|
57894|#823$#I wonder if I could go and get my sisters... No, that's a bad idea!
#824$#You already have me! No one should ever come between us!|
57895|#821$#Fish? I like you so much I would volunteer to be your dinner myself!
#824$#Then I could be a part of you, forever living inside your body!
#823$#Then again, that would be a little creepy... So maybe not.|
57896|#821$#In a mining mood are you?
#822$#Sometimes I wonder about how many different types of rocks exist that I don't even know about. Some of them are so pretty and shiny!|
57901|Have you ever seen a soul?|
57902|I wonder what a soul looks like?|
57903|#822$#Well, I can tell you yours has a really pretty color.
#823$#I was hooked as soon as I saw it!|
57904|#821$#Hm, gentle and powerful. Also, determined and serious.
#823$#That's the impression I got from your soul!|
57905|#821$#The happier the memories, the brighter the color of the soul is!
#822$#Spending time with you is like soaking in a warm sea.
#823$#Any inner darkness I might have had just vanished!|
57906|#821$#Don't you dare look at anyone but me with those eyes!
#824$#I will not look at anyone else either! Not even a bit!
#823$#Do you understand?|
57911|Do you know how to walk?|
57912|Can you use your feet to walk?|
57913|#822$#Walking? Don't be silly!
#821$#Slimes don't walk, they wriggle.|
57914|#822$#A fish swims of course. I bet you've never seen a fish that doesn't swim.|
57915|#821$#Swing your staff gently and BOOM! There you go!|
57916|#823$#Feet? I love your feet!
#822$#They are very toned. Both beautiful and strong!|
57921|Have you been to the Ocean Palace?|
57922|Do you know anything about the Ocean Palace?|
57923|#821$#Palace? It's just a big house. Shouldn't those only be found on land?
#822$#Is that a palace in the ocean? Why would a palace be underwater? You're too funny!|
57924|#821$#That one that seems to be angry all the time and flying around restlessly. Even the weather changes when it's in a foul mood. It's a dragon, I suppose?
#824$#How can a creature turn into a palace? You've gotta be kidding...|
57925|#822$#You want to find the Azure Dragon? You'll have to ask Kitami and Vermilion.
#823$#Sorry, but I'm just a lowly Slime... I don't know anything about an Azure Dragon...|
57926|#821$#I used to live in a huge coral palace with my father and my older sisters.
#822$#We played with all the creatures of the sea every day. Ah, those were the days!
#823$#But now that I'm traveling with you I feel even happier!|
57931|Do you have other family members?|
57932|Tell me about your family|
57933|#821$#Family? All the creatures of the sea are my family!
#823$#Do you know how to swim? I can show you how if you don't.|
57934|#821$#Halibut, starfishes, seahorses... Even sharks!
#823$#As long as we swim and play together we are a family!|
57935|#821$#A Slime is a Slime. We don't have a family!
#823$#Every Slime in the world is comes from the Slime God through mitosis!
#821$#So you see, everyone is the same!|
57936|#825$#The sun is too stong... Please take me back to the water...
#825$#I shall perish otherwise...|
57941|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
57942|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
57943|#824$#Kitami scares me a little... That look in her eyes makes me feel like she is going to devour me...
#822$#Strange... I don't have the same feeling with Ayako!|
57944|#825$#Well, if you don't need me anymore...
#824$#Then I'll just stand in a corner and mourn my abandoned dead soul...|
57945|#821$#What kind of people do you like? Someone like Alucard or Tyr?
#822$#Why use them as examples? Hmm... Diao Chan said that's your type.
#823$#So which one would you pick? The chosen one lives, the other one not so much!|
57946|#825$#Are you... Are you abandoning me?
#825$#Well then... I shall turn into bubbles and pop myself out of existence...|
57951|Do you like to sing?|
57952|I've been told you have a wonderful voice.|
57953|#821$#There are many legends about Sarpa and sirens in your world.
#822$#Like the "The song in the Storm" or "The Voice through the Mists" for example.
#824$#They all seem to end in shipwrecks though... You have to be careful!|
57954|#821$#Hmm, other people's lives are like gold... What happened? I'm busy!
#822$#The next contest is fast approaching so I am practicing hard!
#823$#Last time I came down with a cold but not this time! This time I'll win!|
57955|#821$#If you want to have a wonderful voice you've got to take care of it properly!
#822$#One of the best things for it is a good sleep schedule!
#823$#If you have trouble falling asleep I can sing you a lullaby!|
57956|#821$#Did you know that a love song is made whenever it's raining?
#823$#Wherever the rain falls, on a rooftop or on the ground, all you need to do is listen.
#823$#You'll be able to hear sky's gentle whispers to a couple... Hmm... What? No, I'm not blushing!|
57961|I heard you're a Water Sprite.|
57962|Are you made of water?|
57963|#821$#From what I hear both Water Sprites and humans are mostly made of water.
#822$#Does that make you a Water Sprite too? No? So, human then...
#825$#But why aren't you guys Water Sprites as well then? Humans sure are strange.|
57964|#822$#Do you know about Slimes?
#821$#You do? Then... Are you aware I am a Slime too?
#823$#Teehee, this is a secret! You can't tell anyone!|
57965|#821$#Water is rather magical actually. It always has the most perfect presentation regardless of the space it occupies!
#823$#Even in high level Elder Slimes!
#825$#A performance? Now? No... No way! Elders are deserving of the highest repects! How could it just be random?|
57966|#821$#Zzzzz... Connecting...
#822$#Successfully connected! Here comes the Almighty God of the Universe!
#825$#Hello? God of the universe, I have a question. Hello? Hello? Did He hang up on me? And it took so much effort to connect...|
57971|What staff is that?|
57972|Can you tell me anything about your staff?|
57973|#821$#Are you thirsty? I can give you some water to drink if you want.|
57974|#821$#Do you know the legend of the Fish King's Tribe inheritance?
#822$#Apparently they own a deep sea crystal which can summon sea creatures and control the currents!
#821$#However, it is so powerful that it has to be hidden and
#823$#only the one who wears to the crown can know its location! Magical stuff don't you agree? At least I think so.|
57975|#821$#When I was very little I was badly hurt once...
#822$#Father merged a mystical crystal with me so that I could be saved.
#824$#Honestly, I think my father worried too much! Slimes cannot be killed! We are immortal!|
57976|#821$#Bluer than the bluest ocean, wider than the open sky,
#822$#freer than the wind and yet, softer than a gentle breeze,
#821$#Undine, bound to you eternally, is summoned by your call!
#823$#The Heart of the Ocean is reborn !|
57981|I hear the flesh of mandarinfish is very valuable|
57982|The Secret to Longevity|
57983|#823$#The world you live in, my ocean is a part of it...
#822$#Could it be that you, like a sort of weird fish, breathe with your fins?
#821$#Inhale, exhale. You'll see you can hold your breath for a long time!|
57984|#821$#Ok, pick up your knife and very gently slice it open.
#824$#Hey! Remember... You have to finish every last bit of it!|
57985|#821$#Do you want to give it a try? Since it's you asking I'll allow it!
#824$#Once you swallow that you will see how amazing it is!|
57986|#825$#... You always say or do stuff like that...
#824$#That's kinda hurtful you know?|
57991|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
57992|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
57993|#821$#Are you burning up? You must have a fever or something. That's the only way you could come up with such a ridiculous notion.
#822$#What notion? You thought Slimes could think... I guess you really must be sick.|
57994|#821$#I am working on a magic spell!
#823$#If I succeed we'll be able to be together forever!
#823$#Together in a bubble in the ocean. Forever and ever... And ever!|
57995|#824$#Maybe... Maybe I should give you some peace...|
57996|#822$#You really want to taste mandarinfish flesh right?
#824$#In that case you'll have to eat it all! No sharing allowed!|
58101|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
58102|What do you do in your free time?|
58103|#821$#You'd like to know would you? How about a deal? You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Eh?|
58104|#821$#Ha! You seem to care quite a bit! Are you really so desperate to know?
#823$#Well, let me tell you something even more enticing...|
58105|#822$#Clara requires very delicate maintenance you know!
#821$#Oh! Who is Clara you ask? My puppet of course! You have the attention span of a goldfish I see...|
58106|#822$#Observing you is an education as usual...
#821$#Oh? Why do you keep staring at me?
#823$#Is there something on my face? Maybe I should start charging admission.|
58111|Is there anything in particular that you just can't stand?|
58112|Is there anything you don't like?|
58113|#824$#Ha! I wonder... What do you think?|
58114|#824$#Disgusted?
#824$#When people chase the past or the future, they neglect the present... Don't you think it might get a bit lonely?
#821$#Oh...um... Sorry for nagging you. Just pretend I didn't say anything.|
58115|#824$#What do I hate? Nothing really.
#821$#Will you hold that against me? Ha! Look at you! Don't be so nervous. I'm just kidding!|
58116|#821$#Tell me something you hate then.
#823$#This way I can get to know you even better!|
58121|Is there anyone you have a crush on?|
58122|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
58123|#821$#What? Very cheeky, asking a girl that kind of question.
#823$#Do you really care that much about it? Ha! Hm, should I tell you?|
58124|#821$#Well now, how should I answer this...
#823$#Ha! What would you like to hear?|
58125|#823$#Wouldn't *you* like to know whom I care about.
#821$#Ha! Look at you! You're so cute when you blush! Am I too close?|
58126|#823$#Okay, okay. The person reflected in my pupils is the one I care about.|
58131|Regarding negative feelings|
58132|What are your thoughts on anger?|
58133|#821$#It's an emotion that clouds people's judgement and stops them from thinking clearly.
#822$#Are you also a slave to your emotions? Ha!
#823$#I would love to see what you look like when you're not in control of your feelings.|
58134|#821$#The emotion that belongs solely to the present, not the past nor the future.
#823$#Ha! This feeling is very real! I really like it!|
58135|#822$#Are you angry? Is it because you care so much? Will *I* make you that angry some day?
#821$#Yah! Ha ha! Look at you shaking in your boots! You ok? Are we good?|
58136|#821$#Ah? Having a bad day?
#823$#Hm, you do look great when you're angry. Ha!|
58141|You seem to enjoy smiling.|
58142|You are always smiling.|
58143|#821$#Oops. Really? I didn't even notice.
#823$#Why do you care about that? My smile huh...|
58144|#822$#A smile can be a cover for lots of things.
#821$#Perhaps to hide bad intentions. Perhaps even to cover for internal weaknesses.
#823$#What am I hiding behind my smile then? Ha! Someday I will tell you all of it.|
58145|#823$#Do you like it? My smile?
#821$#Hm... Not everyone's smile has good intentions behind it you know...
#823$#Me? Heh... What do you think?|
58146|#823$#Yeah? Really? You can't keep your eyes away from my smile?|
58151|Have you been the City of Navea yet?|
58152|Heard of Navea?|
58153|#821$#Hm? I've never been there. Is that where you're from?
#822$#No? Then... Can't say I'm all that interested anymore.|
58154|#821$#Well... I have heard of it, but I've never been there.
#822$#There seem to be a lot of people gathering there. Imagine all those different threads of destiny, weaving through each other...
#821$#What? You would like to take me there to check it out?|
58155|#822$#Hm... I guess this is a place of importance for this land?
#821$#It reminds me of the World Tree... Every continent is connected to this busy center.|
58156|#821$#So many races living in different cities... Ha! Just like my hometown.|
58161|Tell me about some of the places you've seen.|
58162|Where have you traveled?|
58163|#821$#Ever since I went to Ventos Prairie I never saw a grassland that beautiful again.
#824$#The Makar there though, not so beautiful... Personality-wise.|
58164|The Tanglevine Cascades have wonderful wetlands.
#823$#But it is indeed a constant battlefield between Dwarves and Sarpa. Ha! Guess the word harmony isn't part of their vocabulary.
#821$#Undine should really show them what for! Right? Are Sarpa and Merfolk the same?|
58165|#824$#The Tempest Desert is always so sandy... That's not good for me at all.
#821$#Would you like to go there? Well, if you have a reason to lure me there... Ha! I might consider going with you|
58166|#821$#Ah! Have you heard of the Chronology Forest?
#822$#There seem to be some sort of power there than can control time.
#823$#Hm, warping the space time continuum... Sounds interesting!|
58171|Tell me about Quests.|
58172|Are there any special quests we can go on?|
58173|#821$#Are you reading the map? The exclamation mark on the top marks where you can accept a quest.
#823$#Ha! You're blushinng aren't you? I can tell. I'm just a little bit closer... Ha!|
58174|#822$#Quest? Meh, not really my thing. Let's talk about something else okay?|
58175|#821$#Mira... Belle Group? Is that the name? I think it is.
#822$#If you're interested, they accept loads of requests.
#821$#Ha! Maybe I should also ask them for some favors.|
58176|#822$#Have you heard of Mirabelle?
#821$#Depending on where the branch is based, different quests will be available.
#823$#But, uh, how about you start by finishing the special mission I gave you before? Ha!|
58181|Sharing heartfelt messages.|
58182|About Mail.|
58183|#821$#Ha! I am right here, why do you need to write a letter?
Wait, it's not for me? Aww... Now I feel sad...|
58184|#822$#Honestly, compared to mailing someone, I prefer speaking in person.
#823$#You know, like we're doing right now!|
58185|#821$#Is there someone specific you don't want to talk to face to face? A mail is a perfect way to avoid that I guess.
#822$#No? Am I wrong?|
58186|#821$#Would you like to send this item to someone? Can you also send emotions attached?
#823$#To whom? Ha! Who do you think?|
58191|Do you know about the estate?|
58192|What's their use?|
58193|#821$#Aside from your house there is also land owned by you.
#823$#But to be honest, I am more interested in your home...
#821$#Would you like to invite me to go with you?|
58194|#821$#So much land... What would you like to do with it?
#822$#Capture pets? Grow crops? Do some mining?
#823$#Or would you like to chill with me inside the cabin? Ha!|
58195|#821$#So there are fields for crops and mines to mine...
#823$#You want to give me flowers and gems? Hm, I guess some people might like that...|
58196|#821$#You can also capture loads of pets in the estate!
#823$#Is there, um, a game you would like to play with me? Like Hide and seek maybe?|
58201|What is the World Tree?|
58202|What's the importance of the World Tree?|
58203|#821$#It's a giant tree that encompasses all realms of existence.
#823$#Hm... Do you really care so much about it? It's the place I live in...|
58204|#821$#The water in the Well of Urd makes the World Tree thrive and keeps it strong enough to support this world.
#824$#Why is it named after my sister? They both safeguard it.|
58205|#821$#The World Tree is rooted in nine realms.
#822$#Except the third root...
#824$#Nidhogg... This ominous name... Do you know of it?|
58206|#823$#The World Tree... Ha! It's like you and me!|
58211|What is the Web of Fate?|
58212|About the Web of Fate.|
58213|#822$#The Web of Fate is woven by me and my sisters, tying together past, present and future.
#821$#Everyone has one from the moment they are born.
#823$#Altough... Your web, it seems different from other people's webs. I'll keep an eye on it.|
58214|#821$#Would you like to know about your own Fate? Oh, I've already put it up in the World Tree...
#823$#If you want to know, you'll have to look it up yourself. But be careful! Do not give in to temptation!|
58215|#821$#My duty is taking care of the Webs of Fate. Well, parts of them. The present to be precise...
#823$#Ha! Our encounter too, was a part of that Fate.|
58216|#822$#When the Web of Fate starts to turn black it's very meaningful. It symbolizes death...
#821$#Ha Ha ha! Don't worry! Your web is still very colorful!
#823$#Ha! For now at least!|
58221|Past, Present and Future.|
58222|What is your opinion about time?|
58223|#824$#Hm, if you would like to know more about the past and the future you'll have to ask my sisters.
#821$#But... I hope you will care more about the present.|
58224|#821$#It comes from the future and turns into the past. What kind of Fate will you create I wonder.|
58225|#821$#Ha! In the end, isn't the now the most important time? You think so too?|
58226|#821$#It is something that keeps fading, but essential to our Fate.
#823$#Would you like to know your own Fate? Hehe, I can't tell you just like that.|
58231|Is your weapon a puppet?|
58232|Tell me about your weapon.|
58233|#823$#You noticed it eh? Its name is Clara. Beautiful huh? It's is my most successful creation!
#821$#Gender? Ha! It's asexual... Would you like to give it one?|
58234|#821$#Clara's body is created from the World Tree. Its skin is made from the Web of Fate.
#823$#I poured my heart and soul into its creation. That's why Clara and me get along so well!|
58235|#821$#Clara is no ordinary weapon. The will it possesses grants him strength and powerful abilities.
#823$#It also makes me fearless! It is very dear to me...|
58236|#821$#A weapon allows you to use force to eliminate your obstacles.
#824$#Violence is unfortunately easy... Other ways are harder, but maybe there's something to be said about them.|
58241|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
58242|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
58243|#821$#Speaking of past, present and future; meeting Eternia is like meeting someone you have known forever!
#823$#Heh, are you jealous?|
58244|#821$#Hm... Zashi is always playing with the kids.
#822$#They won't be able to see her after they grow up...
#821$#Hmmm... I can't bring myself to tell her this... Let her enjoy it for now.|
58245|#821$#Back home, I always saw Hel walking towards the World Tree.
#822$#Ha! She must have forgotten the way back to the Pandemonium.|
58246|#821$#Have you heard Undine's singing? It's beautiful... It's got a certain emotional depth to it.
#823$#Those emotions... You have to experience them for yourself.|
58251|The Norns.|
58252|The relationship between sisters.|
58253|#821$#Have you heard of the Fates? That's what people call us.
#822$#We are the weavers of fate, foretellers for gods and men.
#823$#Do you want to know your fate?|
58254|#821$#Us sisters are called "The noble ones". And you, well... Ha! Just as noble I guess.|
58255|#824$#My sisters? Quite the curious George aren't you?
#821$#Curiosity killed the cat, in case you don't know.|
58256|#824$#Our relationship? It's hard to put it into words...
#823$#I'll tell you more once we spend some more time together and have gotten to know each other better.|
58261|If only we could turn back time...|
58262|About Time Traveling|
58263|#821$#Ha! Is something in your past holding you back?
#823$#Me? The past is gone, there's nothing to be done about it. You should focus on the here and now.|
58264|#821$#If you keep looking back, moving forward becomes a slog.
#824$#Heh, this reminds me of my sisters...|
58265|#821$#Would you like to visit the past or go back to the future?
#822$#Remember the that the now was once the future and will become the past...|
58266|#822$#I really don't care. Why are people so obssessed with the past and the future?
#821$#Ha! Are you like that too?|
58271|Your hair is beautiful.|
58272|Do you prefer long hair?|
58273|#821$#Ha! Compliments will get you nowhere bub!
#823$#Seriously? Well then... Thank you I guess...|
58274|#823$#Ha! I see you have excellent taste. No wonder I was drawn to you.|
58275|#821$#Does my hair blowing in the wind make you feel... Something?
#823$#Ha ha ha! Are you that much into long hair?|
58276|#824$#Hm, compared to short or braided hair, I guess long hair resting on the shoulders does seem naturally prettier.
#821$#You think so too right?|
58281|Do you like your current life?|
58282|Do you think your life lacks a certain something?|
58283|#821$#I am quite happy with it to be honest.
#822$#Oh! You mean if I have any complaints about my life?|
58284|#823$#Meeting you made the "present" even more fulfilling.
#824$#Don't you feel the same? Somehow it feels a little sad...|
58285|#824$#Ordinary? Ha! Every little thing and every single day are important.
#822$#Treasuring the present is very important.
#823$#For example, your existence made my life more interesting! Hehehe...|
58286|#821$#Ha! Do you find your life ordinary?
#823$#Your Web of Fate says otherwise!|
58291|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
58292|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
58293|#821$#Oh, I never bother with what hasn't happened yet.
#824$#If you would like to part ways now... Well, let me think about it.|
58294|#824$#That's a sad thing to consider...
#821$#Instead of worrying about things that haven't happened let's just soldier on together.|
58295|#821$#True. Everything changes eventually.
#822$#I'll probably go back home, and resume my duties of watering the World Tree while weaving the Web of Fate.
#824$#Was that the answer you were looking for?|
58296|#824$#Ha! Did you really think you could get rid of me that easily?|
58401|What is justice?|
58402|The Definition of Justice|
58403|#821$#Haha! Don't be ridiculous!
#822$#I'm literally a Goddess of Justice. There's no one fairer!|
58404|#822$#My scales judge the evil within the world. They weigh each case fairly and objectively.
#823$#Follow me, and set out upon the path to true justice!|
58405|#821$#Are you confused? You must be, because why else would you ask a question like that?
#823$#If you have to ask if something is wrong, it almost certainly is.
#822$#It's really not that difficult to grasp.|
58406|#822$#Prejudice has no place in a just society. We must set aside our differences, until only truth remains.|
58411|How would you handle an encounter with a powerful enemy?|
58412|What's the best strategy for dealing with a powerful enemy?|
58413|#821$#What's the hold up? This needs to be dealt with swiftly and fairly!|
58414|#822$#Even the most powerful of enemies has a weakness.
#821$#Simply study their movements and decide upon the best course of action.
#823$#With careful planning and observation, you'll come out on top every time.|
58415|#821$#I'm impressed!
#823$#You seem capable of overcoming difficult foes.
#822$#But if you still lack confidence, you may stay and train with me.|
58416|#821$#Up against an towering foe? Knock them to the ground!
#824$#"Failure" and "Escape" are not part of my vocabulary.|
58421|What do you think it means to be powerful?|
58422|What is strength to you?|
58423|#821$#Strength is the concrete manifestation of faith.
#822$#Unshakeable faith can shake the earth! Don't you agree?|
58424|#824$#I'm surprised at you. You really don't believe you can do it?
#822$#You've got to have more faith in yourself. I'm impressed!|
58425|#822$#Intense firepower, a violent offensive, and lethal speed.
#821$#Those are the elements that turn the tides of battle. Pretty hard to argue with that, isn't it?|
58426|#822$#Alucard and Dante...
#823$#I'm almost jealous of their power.|
58431|Keep a straight face!|
58432|What's this? Have we got a fighter here?|
58433|#821$#Really? It's not of any real interest to me...
#822$#It reminds me a bit of you, actually.
#823$#Well, don't be shy! It's polite to say "thank you" when someone pays you a compliment!|
58434|#825$#As an arbiter, it's important that I embody both strength and wisdom.
#824$#Otherwise, what credibility would my judgements have?|
58435|#823$#You really think so? Thank you! I'll gladly accept a compliment!|
58436|#822$#Every cause must have a confident leader, one who can bring order to their ranks.
#821$#There's no way around it!
#824$#The slightest misstep could lead to mutiny!|
58441|Everyday Hobbies|
58442|What do you get up to in your free time?|
58443|#821$#You're now responsible for cleaning Jack and Jason's gun barrels. After that, you'll sort out the rations.
#824$#This is a battlefield, not a beach resort!|
58444|#824$#I'm not exactly into shopping...
#821$#Unless you want to shop for weapons, that is!
#823$#Watching master weaponsmiths is so inspiring!|
58445|#822$#I enjoy researching new types of firearms and improving upon the designs I have and maintaining my collection.
#821$#Deliberating? That's my solemn duty... Not my hobby.|
58446|#823$#Jason, Jack, Charlie, and Chuck are all laid out on the bed.
#824$#Sleep? You want to take a nap? This is just a method of communicating with them.
#821$#It's vital that you spend time with your weapons daily.|
58451|What is the Eidolon Energy Crystal?|
58452|What do you know about Eidolon Energy Crystals?|
58453|#824$#Oh? I never expected you would be so unsure about this. I assumed you knew more about it than I do, really.
#821$#It's not unlike a person breathing. While humans exhale air,
#822$# the Cube of Gaia exhales the particles that make up the Eidolon Energy Crystal.|
58454|#822$#When enough power is gathered, it spills over like a cup full of water.
#821$#Except instead of water, it's the Eidolon Energy Crystal!|
58455|#822$#This is really only a fragment of something greater.
#821$#Go on, take it. Once you've gathered enough, something truly incredible might happen.|
58456|#822$#The fragments will only react in areas where a lot of energy converges.
#821$#I'd start by checking the altars if I were you. Just make sure you've got enough fragments with you.
#823$#It should allow you to awaken a sleeping Eidolon!|
58461|Do you know about the Lancer?|
58462|Tell me about the Lancer.|
58463|#822$#It possesses the ability to combine the magical and mechanical! Even Pandora would want a weapon like this.|
58464|#822$#You can attack as you advance, and defend as you retreat. You also have the opportunity to unleash devastating strikes!
#823$#Maybe if you take some time to research its different elemental properties, you could find a way to solve Charlie's ammunition problem.|
58465|#821$#It's been engraved with unique markings that allow the wielder to pull particles from the air to use for special attacks.
#822$#When enough of these particles are combined, they can cause untold devastation. This thing is no toy!|
58466|#822$#The elements the lance can harness are Flame, Darkness, Lightning, and Ice.
#823$#When you combine the different elements, you can get some surprising outcomes.
#824$#What a headache... If we just had more resources we could unlock its mysteries... I'm dying to know what this thing is capable of...|
58471|What do you know about the Templars?|
58472|Hey, tell me something about the Templars.|
58473|#822$#I've heard they're a tough bunch.
#823$#Maybe sparring with them could do you some good.|
58474|#822$#Are they the ones from that headquarters in Navea?
#821$#I heard thewhole outfit is made up of top knights and priests!|
58475|#825$#Even the noble Templars have moments of darkness...
#821$#Yet even in darkness, they know how to turn back into the light.
#823$#We could really learn something from them.|
58476|#821$#Command of the Templar is split between the Lead Knight and the Grand Bishop.
#822$#I'm not entirely sure why, but my guess is that it prevents any one person from becoming too powerful.
#823$#That way one can serve as a balance for the other. It's a pretty good idea, when you think about it!|
58481|How to Connect with People|
58482|How to Connect with Friends|
58483|#821$#The quickest way, of course, is to send a message to the person in question.
#824$#But to be honest, I don't really like that method...
#823$#I'd much rather speak with people face-to-face. Just like this!|
58484|#822$#But if you're too shy to talk to someone face-to-face, you can always send a letter instead.
#823$#I'm sure your message will get through just the same.|
58485|#823$#What's wrong? Having trouble connecting with your friends?
#822$#In that case, try using a bugle so your voice can carry across the entire world!
#823$#Your friends will be sure to hear you then!|
58486|#821$#Go ahead and select a guild that looks interesting!
#822$#Once you've joined, you'll be able to connect with other members.|
58491|Attack vs. Defense|
58492|Weapons and Armor|
58493|#823$#Offense is the best defense. Don't you think so?|
58494|#821$#The faster you attack your target, the quicker you can eliminate the threat.
#822$#Try to keep that in mind when choosing your weapon!|
58495|#822$#Once you've found a weapon that's a good fit, it's time to pick out some armor!
#825$#It's just too bad I don't really know that much about armor... You might have to do a little guesswork there...|
58496|#822$#Hmmm... I guess you could start by figuring out where you need the most protection.
#821$#Most foes will go for the chest and the head first.
#823$#I'd make sure those areas are well-protected before worrying about anything else.|
58501|How versatile are you when it comes to weapons?|
58502|Your weapon is an extension of yourself.|
58503|#822$#Do you have what it takes?
#821$#We'll see... For me, wielding my weapon is as natural as breathing.|
58504|#822$#Each weapon has it's own rhythm.
#823$#If you attune your heartbeat and breathing to your weapon's cadence, they will become like a part of your own body.|
58505|#821$#Don't forget that you can pair different weapons and skills together to produce a variety of attacks.
#823$#If you have time to stick around for a bit, we could spend some time talking about some of the more interesting types of weaponry!|
58506|#822$#Somebody once told me that I could turn anything into a weapon just by holding it.
#824$# I think it was meant as a compliment, but... Well, doesn't it make me sound kind of scary?|
58511|Swordless|
58512|Why don't I carry a sword?|
58513|#822$#Oh? I used to, actually.
#823$#But honestly, I prefer something I can fire!
#823$#Bang! Bang! Bang! There's nothing as satisfying as the sound of a bullet blasting through armor!|
58514|#821$#I may prefer firearms, but that doesn't mean I can't hold my own with a sword!
#823$#I spent years carrying a sword, so it's not like I can't handle myself. Hehehe...
#822$#What? Want me to teach you? Oooo OOOOH! En garde!|
58515|#824$#Swords are fine, I suppose. They get the job done.
#823$#But if you ask me, guns are a lot more exciting!|
58516|#822$#Yes? I don't have one on me at the moment...
#825$#I don't really want to limit myself to nothing but a sword in a tricky situation.|
58521|Judge's Effects|
58522|Scales of Justice|
58523|#821$#You want to see the scales?
#822$#Sorry, I only use them if there's a judgment that needs to be made.|
58524|#822$#What's the matter? You haven't done something wrong, have you?!
#824$#We'd best leave the scales out of this for now... Once you're weighed by the scales, I won't be able to make any pleas in your defense.|
58525|#821$#The scales are a physical manifestation of my spirit. They only appear when a conflict arises that needs my deliberation.
#822$#When that happens, my body goes into a temporary trance state.
#823$#I can still hear the arguments being made though, so I can make a fair judgement. Pretty amazing, isn't it?|
58526|#821$#Each statement made will be marked by a star on the scale.
#822$#Truth on one side, and lies on the other.
#825$#Sadly, the lies usually far outweigh the truth in this world.|
58531|You want to know what the blindfold is for?|
58532|Being able to see is overrated!|
58533|#823$#Heh, actually it's just something I got in the habit of doing when making deliberations.
#822$#If you cover your eyes, you won't be misled by them. It's the best way to remain truly objective when listening to each side's arguments.|
58534|#824$#I actually don't really like being called the "Blindfolded Goddess of Justice."|
58535|#822$#It's true that I cover my eyes before I make a ruling,
#824$#so I understand why they call me that. But... Sometimes it kind of feels like they're making fun of me in a way.|
58536|#824$#Being blindfolded isn't the same thing as being blind!
#822$#I do it on purpose to keep everything as fair as possible. How can they fault me for that?|
58541|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
58542|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
58543|#822$#Whenever I have to work with Pandora, she has her knife at the ready to keep me at a distance from Dante.
#821$#I don't really understand what she's so worried about.
#822$#Dante's far too arrogant for my taste. I prefer people with a bit more restraint.|
58544|#822$#I heard Pandora said Dante was just like an Angel when he saved her.
#821$#Even though he was troubled by her actions, he still accepted her.
#823$#I never imagined that Dante could have a gentle side.|
58545|#822$#Its amazing that they would cross three realms just to track down the person who protected them.
#821$#They're tremendously powerful, but they're good about refraining from abusing that power.
#823$#Alucard deserves a lot of respect for that.|
58546|#822$#I know he's a God of War, but sometimes I can't believe how reckless Tyr is.
#823$#Then again, I had no idea last time we chatted about weaponry that he'd do me such a huge favor!
#821$#He's always running around gathering ingredients and recipes to try to become a better cook for Ayako. It's actually really sweet.|
58551|Views on Love|
58552|Have you ever been in love?|
58553|#822$#Well, I could never be with some puny wet blanket type.|
58554|#822$#I think my ideal would be... maybe a relationship where you feel really comfortable around one another, and your partner always has your back?
#821$#Is that a romantic partner or a fellow soldier?
#824$#Maybe it's the same thing! Haha! You know what they say. Love is a Battlefield!|
58555|#821$#Holding one another up, protecting one another, that's what binds two people together.
#825$#At least... That's what I think it would be like to be in love... I guess I wouldn't really know.|
58556|#824$#Pandora says that ahe sees true love giving up her whole heart and soul to Dante.
#825$#I don't really like the idea of losing your own identity by devoting yourself to someone else, but...
#823$#I'm happy that she's found someone she can feel that way about.|
58561|Tell me about your weapon.|
58562|What's special about your weapon?|
58563|#821$#I usually carry Jack with me wherever I go. He's an automatic pistol.
#822$#He's made from special alloys that make him super light and easy to carry.
#823$#As an added bonus, he's got sentimental value. He was a gift, actually. He's really special to me!|
58564|#822$#Allow me to introduce you to Charlie. Charlie's a portable recoilless rocket launcher!
#824$#He doesn't hold much ammo, and he's kinda' on the heavy side...
#823$#but he's got the kick to absolutely demolish thick armor!|
58565|#821$#Check out these lovely grenades! I call them Chucks!
#822$#The style of the handles are a little bit outdated, but I actually really like the way they're designed.
#823$#They don't roll around like the rounder ones, so you don't have to worry about losing them! And they're a piece of cake to aim!|
58566|#822$#I know you want to ask about the automatic rifle with the grenade mount. I call this one Jason!
#821$#Jason's got a pretty decent firing speed and ammo capacity, and solid firepower to boot!
#823$#The mounted grenade design makes him perfect for dealing damage over a large area.
#823$#Overall, he's top notch as weapons go!|
58571|How's your fashion sense?|
58572|Did you put that outfit together yourself?|
58573|#825$#... Honestly... Fashion isn't really my strength. Maybe we should talk about something else.|
58574|#822$#Getting dressed up? I mean, how hard can it be really? It's fine as long as you don't get carried away.
#824$#I can't really imagine wearing something super flashy!|
58575|#822$#... Pandora thought this would look good on me, so I'm trying it out. Do you like it?
#823$#It's pretty comfortable, and I can move around pretty easily in it. I think I like it!
#824$#... I guess I wouldn't last long anywhere snowy in an outfit like this...|
58576|#825$#What? You don't like it?
#822$#It doesn't matter. I'd rather you just be honest.
#821$#Part of my job is accepting different opinions.|
58581|The Meaning of the Pistol|

58583|#822$#I call this pistol Jack. He was a gift from somebody really dear to me.
#821$#He doesn't have a lot of firepower, but he's become a part of what makes me who I am.|
58584|#822$#A gun says a lot about the person wielding it. I've always believed that.|
58585|#821$#To me, a pistol represents the righteous pursuit of justice, so that's why it fits me so well.
#823$#Also, this one was a gift that I received from those who came before me when I took over this task.|
58586|#821$#If you look really closely, you can see some tiny runes at the bottom.
#822$#Even Pandora would want a weapon like this. She's the only one who can use her weapon.
#823$#And I'm the only one who can use Jack!|
58591|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
58592|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
58593|#821$#If we ever end up going our separate ways, I'll make a weapon just for you.
#822$#If it ever comes to that, I hope it would protect you and be your most loyal companion.|
58594|#821$#Don't worry about me. If that day ever really comes...
#822$#That means I'd have more time to fill orders for custom weapons.
#825$#I can't help but get emotional, thinking about that...|
58595|#822$#You've proven yourself to be a loyal companion.
#825$#If... If this is what you decide, then... I won't stop you.|
58596|#824$#This... Isn't something I can make a judgement on...|
58701|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
58702|What do you do in your free time?|
58703|#821$#I don't understand... What is leisure? So you just sit here? What are you supposed to do while you sit?
#822$#Relax... I can't remember the last time I heard that word.|
58704|#821$#I guess I find looking over the sea of fluffy white clouds relaxing.|
58705|#821$#I don't have time to slow down... Completing my mission has been my sole purpose for as long as I can remember.
#822$#A boring life? I never considered that life could be boring before...|
58706|#822$#Passing time? Don't you have important things to do?
#821$#No, I'm not judging you... I was just wondering.|
58711|Is something wrong?|
58712|You always look so serious.|
58713|#821$#...Why do you feel like that? Frowning? No... I'm not angry.
#822$#I wonder if that's why people keep running away.|
58714|#821$#Not at all... Is this what it looks like when people are unhappy?
#822$#This is just my face...|
58715|#821$#Seriously? This is just how I look, I can't change it.
#822$#I bet this is why it's so hard for me to make friends.|
58716|#821$#You really think I'm too serious? Yes? I really need more friends...
#822$#You're my friend, right?|
58721|What about your combat skills?|
58722|Are you a good fighter?|
58723|#824$#Cut evil off at the source and heal the soul with light.
#821$#... Every battle I face leads to this.|
58724|#822$#I don't like it when people watch me fight...
#821$#I just... I need to be focused on the battle to protect everyone.|
58725|#821$#I'm no expert... I just do what I have to in order to protect people.|
58726|#822$#I guess I could be called an expert after all the battles.
#821$#I never thought about it that way. I just do it to keep everyone safe.|
58731|Is there anyone you have a crush on?|
58732|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
58733|#821$#I like my companions that haven't betrayed me.
#822$#Is that what you mean? Are there different types of liking?|
58734|#821$#I like companions I can talk to. You're one of those.
#822$#Is this one of the different likes? I don't get it... this is really confusing...|
58735|#821$#I used to worry about being flashy...
#824$#But now it doesn't seem very important.|
58736|#824$#Throughout time my eyes have been fixed on one person...
#822$#The good side? Well... now I worry about you.|
58741|Let's talk about feelings.|
58742|It seems like you don't really have feelings.|
58743|#822$#Feelings can be tricky to express.
#821$#It seems like you know how to express your feelings. How do you do it?|
58744|#822$#...
#821$#I think I express my feelings enough... Wasn't that enough?|
58745|#821$#Really? Do people really see me that way?|
58746|#821$#I'm not very good at this... Can you teach me?
#822$#So I just need to smile? That seems like an odd start...
#823$#Like... this?|
58751|Have you been the City of Navea yet?|
58752|Heard of Navea?|
58753|#821$#Navea? It sounds very familiar...|
58754|#821$#I passed through the Human realm before when I was hunting demons.
#822$#There is a magnificent building there.|
58755|#822$#It looks like there are several races there. It's rare for me to see that kind of cooperation.
#821$#But it looks like they're all living together peacefully.|
58756|#822$#Every time I see that white building in the Navea, I think of my hometown...
#821$#No, I don't want to go back. My place right now is by your side.|
58761|Demon sightings have increased recently.|
58762|The demon attacks on the Human realm have become more bold.|
58763|#821$#Are they running out of resources in their own realm?
#824$#It doesn't matter the cause, I will complete my mission and drive them from this place.|
58764|#821$#Are you afraid? Demons can feed on fear and grow strong.
#824$#Only a clear heart can hope to vanquish them. I know you have it in you.|
58765|#821$#Here in the Human realm... So those demons still haven't learned their lesson.
#824$#Don't worry. I'll show them what my sword and I can do.|
58766|#821$#There's barely enough here to break a sweat. We beat them before. There's no reason this time should be different.
#824$#We can do this. Are you ready?|
58771|Do you know about the Lancer?|
58772|Tell me about the Lancer.|
58773|#822$#A Lancer? I only remember a point piercing the darkness.
#821$#Do you think this report is true?
#822$# They seem frightened. I just want to make sure it's actually true.|
58774|#821$#It's a fusion of magic and machinery... I overheard Justicia and Pandora talking about it...
#822$#Go and ask? I guess I could do that... How do you bring that up?|
58775|#821$#Is there a problem? As long as I'm able, I'll do everything I can.
#822$#Lancer? I don't even know where to begin looking.|
58776|#822$#Magic is driven by the elements and combined into various forms.
#821$#Amazing? No... I don't actually know that much about magic... This is just what I've heard.|
58781|Can you tell me about Sanctuaries?|
58782|What is a Sanctuary?|
58783|#822$#It seems like a large pond where you can breed fish.
#821$#In my hometown you can see angels with fishing rods in the clouds.
#822$#But, they couldn't be fishing all the way up there...|
58784|#821$#You also have farmland where you can grow crops. There are plenty of fruits, flowers, and other plants.
#822$#You can't really plant things in the clouds. I'm interested to see how plants grow.
#821$#Really? Can I go look? Thank you for offering.|
58785|#821$#There's even a mine next to the farmland. Otters can use it to mine different types of ore.
#822$#I'm not sure where the ore came from to build the palace in my hometown. Maybe you can use this ore to build a palace too.|
58786|#821$#If you ever get tired of relaxing in your house you can come here to find something to do.
#822$#I don't see how you could get tired of relaxing though. I've been following my mission so long, relaxing sounds like it could be nice.
#821$#Can I relax with you? Thank you... I look forward to it.|
58791|Do you have your own Guardian Knight?|
58792|Do you know of the Guardian Knights?|
58793|#822$#My own... Guardian Knight?
#821$#I've spent my life as the protector. I've never considered that I could be protected.|
58794|#822$#Isn't that what it means to be a professional guardian? Professional...
#821$# Hmm... Does that mean I can't help someone unless they pay me? Right? Or am I thinking about it the wrong way?|
58795|#822$#I'm not really sure... Is it something more than just being companions?
#821$#... What would you call the relationship?|
58796|#822$#Friendship? I don't know very much about it...|
58801|The presence of war?|
58802|What do you think about war?|
58803|#821$#It's a draining existence.
#824$#But if it happens again I will fight like I always have.|
58804|#824$#I fight to defend all the good I've experienced in the world.
#821$#Everyone has a different reason, but looking to the past can be painful...|
58805|#821$#I'm sorry, I don't want to talk about this.|
58806|#824$#You still have to fight, even if the enemy used to be a friend...
#821$#Will the world make it through the war? No one knows...|
58811|Do you like flowers?|
58812|What is your favorite kind?|
58813|#821$#... I don't hate them... so I guess that means I like them.|
58814|#821$#It's interesting that flowers come from the earth. They are so simple, but amazing at the same time. I like flowers that make me feel like this.|
58815|#821$#Are you talking about this flower? It's called a Forget-me-not. It's a beautiful name, right?
#822$#It always reminds me to stay on my path and not be swayed by greed.|
58816|#821$#Have you heard of Forget-me-nots before? I always remember their name, no matter what.
#822$#... I bet that's why they're named that.|
58821|Beautiful Wings|
58822|Are there six wings?|
58823|#821$#They're beautiful but they come with great responsibility.|
58824|#822$#My wings grant me freedom but bind me to duty.
#821$#Being able to fly means I am able to protect even more people.|
58825|#821$#"Six wings: two wings cover the face, two wings cover the body, two wings grant flight."
#822$#Have you heard that before?|
58826|#821$#Oh, yeah I've heard about that. I thought it was two pairs of open wings and one pair closed around the waist.
#822$#Then what about the lowest pair of wings? Oh wait... that's just my clothes...|
58831|Tell me about your weapon.|
58832|What is your weapon?|
58833|#821$#Its light guides me through the darkest battles. Its blade lets me protect those that need it.
#824$#It's called the Holy Sentry.|
58834|#824$#My sword's name is Holy Sentry. It's made to protect rather than kill.
#821$#It's dazzling light leads me down the right path every time.|
58835|#821$#It's called the Holy Sentry. The name reflects the oath to use it to defend people.
#822$#It will defend you as well, since we're companions.|
58836|#821$#The Holy Sentry was given to me by someone very important. It is a constant reminder of my mission.
#822$#... You want to see it? Ok, but please be careful. It means a lot to me.|
58841|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
58842|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
58843|#821$#Serif was always there when Merrilee needed him. It would be great to have someone like that.
#822$#Love? Is that different from companionship? I don't understand the feeling.|
58844|#822$#I always see Serif, Merrilee, and Endora together. They never seem like everything is going right though.
#821$#Serif does have quite a few companions. I'm a bit envious... Yes? Am I wrong?|
58845|#821$#Uzuriel, Uriel and I were companions once.
#822$#But over time we drifted our separate ways.|
58846|#821$#Everyone used to think Dante was amazing...
#824$#But his arrogance and greed led to his downfall.|
58851|Which color do you like?|
58852|Black or white?|
58853|#821$#I don't have a favorite color, but black can look nice...
#824$# That doesn't make you like it.|
58854|#821$#The pureness on white always seems to calm people.
#822$#Does it have that effect on you?|
58855|#821$#Are there only two answers to this?|
58856|#821$#Holy white can turn to abyssal black if you aren't careful.
#824$#It always reminds me of Dante's fall.|
58861|The halo on my head?|
58862|Oh, you want to know what it means?|
58863|#822$#... This one can't be shared. It's pretty much stuck on my head.
#821$#Maybe I can find something else for you as a symbol of our friendship.|
58864|#821$#It has a special presence to it, right? It keeps drawing your eye.|
58865|#821$#It is an angelic symbol, but not every angel has one.
#822$#It shows that I'm on a divine mission only I can undertake.|
58866|#821$#The halo helps guide my hand and keep me steady.
#824$#It also prevents me from sliding into temptation.|
58871|You're known as the Sleepless Angel?|
58872|You really don't sleep?|
58873|#821$#... I've never heard of you before. Where did you hear it?
#822$#... No... I'm not trying to be rude...|
58874|#821$#This is just the first time I've heard the name. It seems like it comes with a lot of responsibility.|
58875|#822$#... Is the sleeplessness caused by the horrors of war?
#821$#Even though I bear heavy burdens, I still need some amount of sleep.|
58876|#822$#Where did you hear this? It's just... I'm not used to letting other people see me sleep...
#821$#You can't fulfil your duties if you don't get enough sleep.|
58881|So, about companions...|
58882|What do you think about them?|
58883|#821$#You share supplies and fight side by side, like us... right?|
58884|#821$#We have a history of standing side by side. I... I always miss those times.
#824$#But you have to leave the past behind and move forward. Now I have you by my side.|
58885|#821$#That is the only thing that matters. Being betrayed never gets any easier.
#822$# That might have been what broke me... After that I couldn't connect with anyone.
#821$#But, with you... I feel like I can speak my mind. It's odd.|
58886|#824$#Even the most trusted companion can become an enemy overnight though.
#821$#You wouldn't do that, would you?|
58891|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
58892|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
58893|#821$#When you leave.. Will we still be companions?|
58894|#821$#I didn't think about it before, but our journey will end soon, right?
#822$#... Are you laughing? I was being serious...|
58895|#821$#Even if we're not side by side, I'll still protect you.
#822$#Stalk you? No, nothing like that!|
58896|#825$#Easy come, easy go. Have I lost a companion again?|
58897|Kabuto! Protect your master!|

58944|Hmm, where should I put this?|
58945|Do not... come close to the master.|

60169|#822$#Are you sure about this price for %s1? Have you compared it with prices elsewhere?|
60170|#822$#You're thinking of buying %s1? Is that really the best use of your money?|
60171|#822$#Wow! This %s1 isn't bad at all. If you see anything else this good, you should buy it right away!|
60172|#822$#Yeah! The %s1 you put up for auction has sold. Let's hope  the buyer takes good care of it.|
60173|#822$#Wow, the %s1 you auctioned off has been bought. I never thought that someone would go for that price...|
60174|#822$#The %s1 you offered was sold. The buyer must be thrilled to have a new toy to play with!|
60175|#821$#Isn't this %s1? Do you think you may have paid too much for it? Remember to shop around!|
60176|#821$#Wow, you must be feeling generous today! That's a healthy price for a %s1!|
60177|#824$#Do some price checking before you buy something next time. You shouldn't need to pay that much for %s1.|
60178|#823$#What? Your %s1 actually sold at that exorbitant price? Impressive.|
60179|#821$#Nice! %s1 has been sold. Any moment now we will be millionaires, right?|
60180|#823$#Ha ha, another chump has bought your overpriced %s1. Even I can't help but laugh!|
60181|#823$#My, you have good taste! This %s1 is of the highest quality.|
60182|#823$#You should teach a class on bargaining! I can't believe you got %s1 for that price.|
60183|#821$#Maybe you should have shopped around before paying that much.|
60184|#822$#The %s1 you auctioned has been sold. Maybe you ask for a bit more money next time.|
60185|#821$#The %s1 you put up for auction has been purchased. Don't forget to get the money out of your mailbox!|
60186|#822$#Nice! The sale of %s1 has earned you some cash. Go sell some more stuff!|
60187|#821$#You do have impeccable taste. You picked the finest %s1 out of so many others.|
60188|#824$#Are you finally done shopping? I'm bored half to death.|
60189|#824$#Highway robbery! That %s1 is way too expensive!|
60190|#822$#Well, %s1 has been auctioned off... But I think it should have gone for more than that.|
60191|#821$#Aren't we partners? Where's my cut of the auction money for %s1?|
60192|#823$#Yeah, you sold another item. Let's hope  gets good use out of it.|
60193|#821$#Now's the time to buy %s1. It will only get more expensive if you wait.|
60194|#822$#You'll never get rich if you only buy stuff. Put some things up for sale!|
60195|#821$#I wonder why the seller wanted to part with such a high quality %s1.|
60196|#821$#That price for %s1 is too low. You should raise it by 10% or so.|
60197|#822$#Someone has bought the %s1 that you put up for auction.|
60198|#821$#The %s1 that you put up for auction has sold. You're well on your way to being rich!|
60199|#821$#That's a good buy! %s1 ought to be very useful.|
60200|#822$#Well, what's done and done. No point in regretting paying such a ridiculous price.|
60201|#824$#%s1? Really? What's useful about one of those? Is there something you're not telling me?|
60202|#821$#Excellent! You've sold %s1 for all kinds of cash! We can live it up tonight.|
60203|#822$# Should feel lucky that you offered %s1 at such a... generous... price.|
60204|#821$#Another one sold! %s1 must be quite popular.|
60205|#821$#I hope it's true when they say "you get what you pay for." At this price, %s1 had better be top-notch.|
60206|#824$#I'd thought you were going to buy me something nice, but instead you came back with %s1...|
60207|#821$#The auction house has all sorts of interesting stuff up for sale! We could be here a while...|
60208|#822$#You made a ton of scratch by selling %s1. Don't spend it all in one place!|
60209|#821$#The buyer should be very happy with a new %s1, right?|
60210|#822$#A buyer has already bought your %s1. That person was pretty lucky to have found such an item at that price before someone else snatched it up!|
60211|#824$#This %s1 feels strange... Is it used?|
60212|#822$#You've been at the auction house forever... Did you buy anything?|
60213|#823$#Wow! That price has to be a mistake! Buy it now before they fix it!|
60214|#824$#Check it out... That %s1 you auctioned off sold out in no time! You should have listened to me and sold it for a more!|
60215|#823$#I can't believe that old %s1 was bought by . I think they might come to regret that decision...|
60216|#823$#Wow, I never could have expected you'd get that much for %s1. Maybe you have a future as a merchant after all!|

60234|#821$#Check out this exquisite %s3! It's hard to believe how your skills at making %s2 have progressed.|
60235|#821$#It must be tough to make %s3... Here's a hanky to deal with all of that sweat.|
60236|#822$#Your skill at making %s2 has improved tremendously! Why not try your hand at making some other stuff?|
60237|#821$#After looking around at all the other %s3, I can say that the one that you made is the best!|
60238|#824$#Oh, my, you are a mess. Maybe you need to stop making %s3 and take a shower.|
60239|#822$#Keep at it! You've been studying %s2 for so long, but only managed to make %s3. You'll get there eventually!|
60240|#822$#The layman would think that this %s3 is exquisite... No that's not a compliment, I'm only saying that my standards are much higher.|

60323|#822$#This %s1 is the result of blood, sweat and tears. Oh, and toil! Everyone always forgets about toil for some reason...|
60324|#821$#I'm impressed! It takes quite a lot of work to fortify %s1 to this level.|
60325|#822$#That's quite a bit of time and money you've invested in fortifying that up to +%s2.|
60326|#821$# I never thought that I would actually see a %s1 that has been fortified to +%s2! Can't wait to see how great it can be!|

60334|#823$#Nice! Yet another piece of rare gear fortified!|
60335|#822$#I heard a rumor that if %s1 is fortified to +%s2, it will shine in the moonlight.|
60336|#821$#You've been working for so long to foritfy this to +%s2... Now it's time to go show it off!|
60337|#823$#Ha! I'd be unstoppable if I could use %s1!|
60338|#822$#I told you that fortifying up to +%s2 is no big deal.|
60339|#821$#Your newly fortified %s1 is like a whole new item. Go find some monsters to test it out on!|
60340|#823$#Hmmm, I wonder how much this +%s2 %s1 would go for at the Auction House...|

60342|#822$#Who needs Legendary gear? Keep fortifying %s1 until it's just as good!|
60343|#821$#Congrats! You've fortified %s1 to +%s2! This should be worth all kinds of gold!|
60344|#823$#Oooh... Now that %s1 has been fortified, it's emitting a powerful aura. It's almost like it's alive!|
60345|#821$#I'd take something that you've fortified and made your own over some frou-frou gear on the sale rack!|
60346|#823$#You know... I can be fortified too... FEED ME!|
60347|#822$#A freshly-fortified %s1 looks great on you!|

60349|#821$#Fortification is fun! I always get a nice, warm, fuzzy sensation when it's successful!|
60350|#822$#%s1 is a piece of gear befitting a hero like yourself!|
60351|#822$#Am I missing something? Why are you spending so much time fortifying %s1?|

60358|#822$#Lookit those stats go! You'll definitely be more effective with this.|
60359|#821$#Did you know that I'm lucky? If you give me all your gold coins, I can guarantee a successful fortification!
#823$#No? Drat! Sometimes I wish you were more gullible.|
60360|#822$#Well, well! Fortifying %s1 to +%s2 shows that you have plenty of time and money...  Why don't you fortify my equipment as well?|

60391|#821$#Even the biggest, baddest bosses will tremble before the might of %s2! Tremble, I say!|
60392|#822$#Dungeon, shmungeon. With %s2 in your repertoire, they'll all be a piece of cake!|
60393|#821$#Wow! The moment you learned %s2, I could sense a great increase in your power.|
60394|#823$#Let's head to the battlefield to give %s2 a try!|
60395|#822$#Masteries come from the heart as much as the muscles. You have to focus and study for many hours; you can't just go through the motions.|
60396|#821$#Woo! %s2 is a super-powerful skill that can only be learned after long hours of study.|
60397|#821$#Congrats on mastering %s2! Keep training and learning new skills, and you'll soon be the best Envoy around!|
60398|#822$#Was that %s2? When did you learn that? Have you been studying when I'm not looking?|
60399|#821$#%s2 is, like, redonkulously powerful! No wonder they call it a Mastery!|
60400|#824$#I wish I knew some of your Masteries... Perhaps I can study %s2 the next time we have a break.|
60401|#821$#Masteries are all kinds of useful. You should learn as many as you can.|
60402|#823$#Nicely done! Not everyone can get the hang of %s2.|
60403|#823$#%s2 sure made short work of those baddies!|
60404|#823$#Tee hee... I look forward to seeing the enemy grovel for mercy when faced with your potent %s2.|
60405|#822$#Another Mastery? Looks like you're a quick study.|
60406|#821$#Finally, a new skill! %s2 should be able to spice up your fighting style... I didn't want to say anything, but it's been kinda bland for a while.|
60407|#824$#Oh, wow, was that %s2? It looked like a magic trick, except by "trick" I mean "lots of wicked damage."|
60408|#822$#%s2 should give you a nice boost during your adventures, provided you actually know how to use it.|
60409|#821$#Did you just reset your Skill Points? You should plan them out a bit more carefully this time.|
60410|#821$#Give some thought to how you want to develop before you go throwing points around all willy-nilly.|
60411|#821$#Something's different about you. New haircut, maybe? You have a different air about you than usual.|
60412|#821$#Just like a healthy diet, you want a healthy balance to your skill points as well.|
60413|#821$#Take a moment to plan out where you want to go before you go tossing points about.|
60414|#823$#It's okay, we all make mistakes. Just... don't make a habit of it.|
60415|#821$#What's this? I think you may have become a bit more charming after resetting your skill points...|
60416|#821$#Giving your skill points another try? Cool. Might I suggest putting everything into DMG?
#822$#Too bad those DEF points have to go to boring things. Why can't they go to DMG as well? So unfair...|
60417|#821$#HP Potions are the lifeblood of any adventurer. Make sure you always have some on hand!|
60418|#822$#It seems obvious, but if your health gets low you should quaff an HP potion right away!|
60419|#821$#Oh my, what did you eat? You seem so full of vim and vigor!|
60420|#822$#I've heard that %s2 is the tops when it comes to gourmet cuisine. I'd like to taste it!|
60421|#821$#You need to eat regularly so you have the energy to fight monsters. Three square meals a day!
#822$#I wonder why they call them "square" meals...|
60422|#822$# I can feel the energy inside you! Is it what %s2 does to you?|
60423|#821$#There's no shame in needing to choke down an HP Potion. And even if there was shame, you'd at least still be alive to feel it!|
60424|#824$#You needed an HP Potion already? That was fast! Maybe we should head over to the armor shop...|
60425|#821$#Ooh, %s2 looks yummy... Can I have a bite?|
60426|#822$#Holy mackerel! Where'd this strength come from?|
60427|#821$#I don't know if I can eat this! Knowing how much time someone must have spent on it, it'd be like eating a work of art!|
60428|#821$#An excellent choice! %s2 is the kind of food that's perfect fuel for fightin'!|
60429|#821$#Don't take this the wrong way, but... Maybe instead of relying so heavily on HP Potions you should, I don't know... get better at fighting?|
60430|#821$#Careful! Your health is really low!|
60431|#823$#You should take it easy after eating a big meal. Give it an hour or two so your stomach can settle.|
60432|#823$#Ooh la la! %s2 is a dish that's in high demand! I heard it's a delicacy for even the Navean nobility!|
60433|#821$#You can have your Paleo-Atkins-Homeopathic nonsense. I'll take a good old-fashioned %s2 any day!|
60434|#821$#Oh my, something smells delish! What is it?|
60435|#821$#That meal was... interesting. I think I need to gargle some bleach.|
60436|#821$#HP Potions are your friend! You're supposed to drink your friends, right?|
60437|#822$#You know what they call someone who eats all sorts of delicious food and doesn't share? Jerk. They call them a jerk.|
60438|#823$#%s2? I think I saw Gordon Oliver cooking that on the FoodView TV network last night!|
60439|#822$#Why do you have so many %s2s? Are they all presents for me? Oh, you shouldn't have!|
60440|#821$#Are you full? I'm full AND sleepy. Let's take a nap somewhere. I get to be the big spoon!|
60441|#821$#Be careful! Remember that once you suck down an HP Potion, you can't drink another one for a while.|
60442|#821$#You know... your health is kinda low. Maybe an HP Potion wouldn't be a bad idea.|
60443|#822$#Crikey! If you eat that quickly, you're certain to get a stomachache!|
60444|#821$#%s2 is good for circulation, and circulation is good for being in top fightin' condition!|
60445|#822$#I've heard that %s2 is incredibly difficult to manufacture. Every step is very precise and difficult.|
60446|#821$#%s2 is the latest and greatest! You little trendsetter...|
60447|#821$#Come on, stick with it! We're just getting warmed up!|
60448|#822$#HP Potions really aren't that expensive, so there's no need to be stingy with them. It's your life, after all.|
60449|#822$#Ooh, that smells wonderful! I will totally claim to be on a diet while stealing bites when you're not looking.|
60450|#824$#You must really like %s2. I never understood. Give me simple proteins and carbohydrates, not this overly elaborate mumbo-jumbo you call "cooking."|
60451|#822$#Ah, now this is the way to enjoy %s2! If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't... Oh, am I not allowed to finish that quote?|
60452|#821$#Stop stuffing your face and let's go complete some quests!|
60453|#821$#Here, let me give you a hand with that. What? No, I meant with %s2!|
60454|#822$#I always feel a little bit warm and fuzzy after using %s2.|
60455|#821$# Hey, hey, slow down. Check yourself before you wreck yourself!|
60456|#821$#Did you like %s2? Let me cook it for you sometime!|
60457|#822$#Wow, you look like you have really 'enjoyed' that food. Here, have a napkin.|
60458|#821$#Aww, you look adorable when you are eating!|
60459|#824$#Don't be ashamed of a well-timed HP Potion! There's no point in being brave if it gets you killed.|
60460|#824$#Are you feeling sick? Maybe you should try some %s2.|
60461|#824$#Holy cow! Another meal? Careful, at this rate you'll swell up like a balloon!|
60462|#822$#Is that %s2? I love %s2! I was surprised to find that you humans actually know a thing or two about food.|
60463|#821$#You ate without me? How could you?|
60464|#823$#You should slow down and chew your food. Eating %s2 too quickly will give you a stomachache.|
60465|#821$#Hey, you've been stunned! Snap out of it!|
60466|#821$#Wake up! Don't make me do this by myself!|
60467|#821$#It's a good thing you're wearing good gear; even though the enemy has reduced your DEF, you're still pretty hardy.|
60468|#821$#They're sapping your attack power? Don't worry, I'll make up the difference!|
60469|#821$#Don't panic! This curse is only temporary.|
60470|#821$#Hmm. Something about this flame looks strange...|
60471|#821$#Hey, I'm frozen over here... Get me out!|
60472|#821$#Nice! You shrugged off that huge electricial current without so much as a scratch!|
60473|#821$#This may be a weak poison, but it can be deadly if you ignore it for too long.|
60474|#821$#Just hold on! The ice should melt soon.|
60475|#821$#It's nice to slow down once in a while, right?|
60476|#821$#Watch out! A powerful attack is coming!|
60477|#821$#Are you okay? Can you stand?|
60478|#821$#Uh oh, you've been knocked out! Hang on!|
60479|#821$#Hey, no sleeping on the job! Wake up!|
60480|#821$#Your defenses are down! Get behind me while I try and draw their fire.|
60481|#821$#It's not the end of the world to fight without your weapon, is it? You're pretty burly without it.|
60482|#821$#You look famished! Let's go get some food.|
60483|#821$#Bah! It's just a little fire. No biggie!|
60484|#821$#You won't let a puny little ice cube get you down, right?|
60485|#821$#If the usual stuff isn't working, then maybe you should switch up your tactics.|
60486|#821$#Pain is weakness leaving the body!|
60487|#821$#So your legs are frozen. That's no big deal. You can still fight!|
60488|#821$#Wow, you're moving like you're old and crippled.|
60489|#821$#No, no, you're doing it all wrong. Go bigger! Go stronger!|
60490|#821$#Ha! These enemies are pathetic!|
60491|#821$#Relax. The dizziness should pass soon.|
60492|#821$#It's important to keep a clear head! Taking a nap in the middle of a battle is a bad idea.|
60493|#821$#If the enemy has worn away your defenses, maybe you should beat a hasty retreat and try again later.|
60494|#821$#You've only been temporarily weakened. Fight through it and you'll be right as rain in no time!|
60495|#821$#This curse... It really stinks!|
60496|#821$#Stop, drop and roll! STOP, DROP AND ROLL!|
60497|#821$#Brr! As soon as this ice melts, I'm going for a mug of hot cocoa.|
60498|#821$#I know this is a bit late, considering you're already paralyzed... But maybe try avoiding those kinds of attacks in the future? Just saying...|
60499|#821$#Hey-o, Captain Obvious here. You should get this poison cured as soon as possible.|
60500|#821$#Seeing you stuck there in that block of ice gives me a fabulous idea: mojitos!|
60501|#821$#Don't get in a head-on fight when you're slowed down like this. Try and avoid battle until you go back to normal.|
60502|#821$#That looked like it hurt! I'm glad I got out of the way... Oh, I mean, hey, are you okay?|
60503|#821$#Lookout! A big attack is coming!|
60504|#821$#You're feeling dizzy and are having trouble moving? Did you forget your flu shot this year?|
60505|#821$#Are you sleepy? Maybe you should go to bed earlier! Or drink SIX BILLION CUPS OF COFFEE.|
60506|#821$#Wow, the enemy tore right through your armor! Tee, hee, nice underpants!|
60507|#821$#That was it? You must be weak with hunger; let's call out for a pizza.|
60508|#821$#Um... Your shadow just turned and smiled at me... I think you should get this curse lifted ay-sap.|
60509|#821$#No, you can NOT give me a hug while you are on fire!|
60510|#821$#You're as cold as ice! You're willing to saaaaacrifice our love!
#824$#What? I like singing. Don't look at me like that.|
60511|#821$#You went and got yourself paralyzed, huh. Nice work.|
60512|#821$#Have you looked in a mirror lately? Your skin is turning kind of green. Have you thought about getting that poison cured?|
60513|#821$#Looks kind of cold in there. No, I will not be joining you.|
60514|#821$#Less Tortoise, more Achilles!|
60515|#821$#Why are you being so hard on yourself? You should be hard on the enemy!|
60516|#821$#Yipes! That seems like the sort of attack that could one-shot me. I'm glad it didn't connect.|
60517|#821$#You know, you can fortify your gear so you take less damage while dizzy.|
60518|#821$#WAKE UP! This is hardly the time to be sleeping!|
60519|#822$#Be careful! Your defense has been reduced a bunch.|
60520|#821$#Nice punch! I had no idea you were so tough without your weapon.|
60521|#822$#You seem weak. Are you okay?|
60522|#821$#Oh my, you're burning up! Where's a fire extinguisher when you need one...|
60523|#821$#Good thing your gear isn't affected by the cold! It'd be a shame if it froze and then shattered.|
60524|#821$#Hey, why'd you stop moving? Are you stuck? Have you gone numb?|
60525|#824$#Sniff sniff... What's that smell?|
60526|#821$#That creepy magical ice will be gone soon... Just deal with it.|
60527|#821$#Hey, buddy, you okay? Your vital signs are dropping!|
60528|#821$#Careful! A huge attack is coming!|
60529|#822$#Bah! Only a flesh wound!|
60530|#823$#I'll fight in your place until the dizziness wears off!|
60531|#824$#That's cool, I'll be fine on my own. I'm completely okay with fighting all these enemies single-handedly while you take a nice, refreshing nap.|
60532|#822$#Take a few steps back, champ! Your defense is down significantly right now.|
60533|#824$#Do you feel a bit useless without your weapon? Looks like someone needs more training!|
60534|#821$#Oh no, you've been cursed! Ewwwww.|
60535|#821$#I couldn't help but notice that you've been set on fire. Did you know that the latest auraPhone has an app to fix that?|
60536|#821$#You look so sad and pale encased in that ice cube. I'd offer to help, but... I'm just not a fan of the cold. You'll be fine.|
60537|#821$#Mind over matter! Just focus, and those paralyzed nerves will start responding again in no time!|
60538|#821$#You might want to try dodging the attack that can poison you. The best medicine is prevention!|
60539|#822$#Just ignore all that frozen icy stuff, and keep on fighting!|
60540|#821$#Being slow isn't the end of the world. Unless the world is a race! No, that'd be weird.|
60541|#821$#Wear your battle scars with pride! They serve as reminders of the challenges you have overcome.|
60542|#821$#Hey, are you okay? I'm impressed you survived that!|
60543|#821$#Are you feeling dizzy? It's okay, I often have that effect on people.|
60544|#822$#Oooh, is it naptime already? Good thing I brought this blanket along!|
60545|#821$#Don't worry! I'll keep you safe!|
60546|#821$#You're fighting without a weapon now? That looks like fun! I wanna try it, too!|
60547|#821$#Looks like you need a nurse to treat this curse before you end up in a hearse! Or worse!|
60548|#821$#Have you seen the youtubes of that guy on fire? That's EXACTLY what you look like right now!|
60549|#821$#Are you cold? I know a thing or two that might warm you up...
#824$#What? No, I have a blanket here. What were you thinking about?|
60550|#821$#Are you feeling numb? Fortunately for you, I just earned my certificate in Deep-Tissue Bikram Jackhammer Massage Type Zero! Hai-yaa!|
60551|#822$#That poison is totally gross; it's making you foam at the mouth! Wha... EWW! GET AWAY FROM ME!|
60552|#821$#Ohmygosh! It's so cold in here, I can barely... Hey! What are you staring at?|
60553|#821$#Oh, you've slowed down a bunch! That's okay, it's good to take it slow every now and then.|
60554|#824$#Eek! A big attack is coming! I know, I'll hide behind you!|
60555|#822$#I'm glad I have you to protect me! I don't like the thought of some big meanie beating me up...|
60556|#822$#Focus! Keep it together! The spins will go away soon!|
60557|#821$#Wake up, sleepyhead! There's stuff to do!|
60558|#822$#What happened to you? You used to be so fearless...|
60559|#824$#My, my, you're nothing without your weapon, are you? Stop cowering behind me and stand up for yourself!|
60560|#823$#The wailing of the spirits that are haunting you is kind of amusing.|
60561|#821$#Oh my, your face is so red! Are you feeling alright?|
60562|#822$#What happened? Your hands are like ice! In fact, they ARE ice!|
60563|#822$#No, this won't do at all. Snap out of it! You have to be able to move so you can continue to serve me!|
60564|#824$#Seriously? That meager attack has left you envenomated? Looks like you need to toughen up a bit.|
60565|#823$#The coating of crystal-clear ice across your body is quite striking. I want a picture. Keep still! Right, you can't move, of course you'll keep still...|
60566|#822$#Ugh, come on! We haven't got all day, slowpoke!|
60567|#823$#Why are you wasting your time with these feeble enemies? Let's go after something challenging!|
60568|#824$#You couldn't even dodge that ridiculously slow attack? I wonder about you sometimes...|
60569|#821$#It was tough sledding, but you finally completed %s1! Now people are starting to take notice of your exploits.|
60570|#822$#Ka-ching! The reward for %s1 makes the effort well worth it.|
60571|#822$#Finally! It seemed like that quest took forever to finish up!|
60572|#821$#Good call on taking on %s1 from the bulletin board.|
60573|#821$#Easy-peasy! I could have handled %s1 in my sleep!|
60574|#823$#Low risk, high reward! Quests like %s1 are awesome!|
60575|#823$#Another quest handled, another notch in my belt! What's next?|
60576|#821$#Wow! The person who entrusted us with %s1 sure is generous! This reward is amazing!|
60577|#823$#It took a lot of hard work to finish up %s1. Maybe now is a good time to take a break.|
60578|#823$#Yes! Another quest in the bag. Are we good at this or what?|
60579|#821$#Mirabelle's bulletin board is a great place to sharpen your skills. The rewards aren't too shabby, either.|
60580|#822$#%s1 was kind of weird. Even though it's over, I'm still not sure exactly what happened.|
60581|#824$#Geez, finally! %s1 was exhausting! Who knew it would be such a pain?|
60582|#821$#You took on %s1 because you want to help people, right? Not just because of the reward?|
60583|#822$#Yes! That's done! Now, I say it's naptime.|
60584|#821$#What a wacky request! %s1 just goes to show the world is a weird place.|
60585|#821$#You did such a bangup job on %s1, people are really starting to take notice of you!|
60586|#822$#Keep taking on quests like %s1, and you'll be famous before you know it.|
60587|#821$#What a trip! I never expected that...|
60588|#822$#The person who commisioned %s1 sure was appreciative of your efforts!|
60589|#821$#Yeah! %s1 has left me all fired up! I haven't gotten to show my stuff like that in a while.|
60590|#822$#Keep it up! Your hard work on quests like %s1 has helped a lot of people.|
60591|#821$#Good thing you accepted this quest! I think anyone else would have crashed and burned.|
60592|#824$#Seriously? This is all we get for %s1? That's hardly fair...|
60593|#821$#We are rolling in dough after completing %s1! Happy-happy!|
60594|#822$#I don't want to seem like I'm riding your coattails or anything, but I sure couldn't have handled %s1 on my own.|
60595|#821$#I had a good feeling about this quest ever since we first looked at it on the board.|
60596|#821$#I hope everything we do in the future is as interesting as %s1 was.|
60597|#822$#So you've finally finished this troublesome task... Can we please move on to something interesting now?|
60598|#824$#If the next quest is going to be as troublesome as %s1 was, let me know so I can think of an excuse to get out of it.|
60599|#822$#These people are so helpless. Can't they do anything for themselves?|
60600|#821$#%s1 is all wrapped up, so what's next?|
60601|#821$#Is %s1 stronger than you?|
60602|#823$#So you've asked %s1 to tag along? Where are you thinking of going?|
60603|#821$#Is %s1 tougher than I am?  I think we might find out very soon!|
60604|#822$#%s1 seems like a worthy ally. The two of you together can surely tackle any obstacle.|
60605|#821$#Is it fate that drew you and %s1 together?|
60606|#823$#With %s1 in the party, you're now twice as strong. Don't hold back!|
60607|#822$#Why are you inviting %s1 along? Do you have a crush on them or something? It's okay, you can tell me.|
60608|#821$#%s1 looks like they know what they're doing. This should be fun!|
60609|#821$#Be polite when you invite %s1 to come along. A first impression is the most important one!|
60610|#823$#%s1 seems like they're easy to get along with. This should go smoothly!|
60611|#821$#Yeah, invite %s1 along! It's boring to always go at it alone.|
60612|#822$#Ooh check it out! %s1's gear looks shiny... They must have spent a lot of time and effort fortifying their stuff!|
60613|#821$#I trust your judgement in picking party members!|
60614|#822$#Rrrowr! %s1 is cute!|
60615|#821$# Be careful when you are working with %s1, they might drag you down.|
60616|#822$#%s1? Really? Okay, if you insist...|
60617|#821$#Let's have a super fantastic adventure with %s1!|
60618|#821$#Now that you've roped in some friends, we should tackle something that would be tough to do on your own.|
60619|#821$#If %s1 is gonna lead this group, they'd better be strong.|
60620|#824$#What's %s1 like? You know I can't just follow anybody.|
60621|#821$#I have a feeling that %s1 will be a great leader!|
60622|#823$#Now that you've joined up with %s1's group, you should introduce me to all of your new friends!|
60623|#822$#Who are all of these people in %s1's party? Are they cool?|
60624|#821$#If %s1 leaves the group, I think you should replace them as the leader! Just saying...|
60625|#821$#Is %s1 someone you already knew? If not, remember to introduce yourself.|
60626|#823$#I feel up for more adventures today! Let's see what the people from %s1's group are up to!|
60627|#822$#%s1 seems like they're pretty smart. How do I know? Because they invited us along!|
60628|#821$#If you've agreed to join %s1's group, you must think they're pretty capable. Am I right?|
60629|#821$#Is %s1 taking us somewhere scary and dangerous? Eep! You have to stay by my side at all times!|
60630|#822$#%s1 seems like they know how to take care of their allies. I think this group is a good fit for us!|
60631|#821$#I dunno... %s1 seems kind of shady to me. Like they have an ulterior motive for asking you to join...|
60632|#822$#Have you traveled with %s1 before? I'm curious because you agreed to join up with them without the slightest hesitation.|
60633|#823$#%s1?! Congratulations! You're very lucky considering how rare it is.|
60634|#821$#%s1? Not bad, not bad at all! Do you want to keep this item or try for something even nicer?|

60636|#821$#%s1? Not bad, not bad at all! Do you want to keep this item or try for something even nicer?|

60641|#823$#%s1?! I can barely believe my eyes! You totally lucked out!|
60642|#822$#Well, I guess it's not that bad. But if I were you, I'd aim a bit bigger.|
60643|#822$#Well, I guess it's not that bad. But if I were you, I'd aim a bit bigger.|
60644|#822$#Well, I guess it's not that bad. But if I were you, I'd aim a bit bigger.|
60645|#822$#%s1?! Sweet! I wonder how much it sells for... Huh? There are even nicer things? Tough choice, eh?|
60646|#822$#%s1?! Sweet! I wonder how much it sells for... Huh? There are even nicer things? Tough choice, eh?|
60647|#822$#%s1?! Sweet! I wonder how much it sells for... Huh? There are even nicer things? Tough choice, eh?|
60648|#823$#%s1?! What a score! Let's cash out and get paid! Woohoo!|
60649|#823$#You're very lucky. This %s1 will be a great help on your next adventure.|

60673|#823$#%s1? I think you can do better. Go big or go home!|
60674|#822$#%s1? I wouldn't settle for something like that. Better prizes await!|
60675|#822$#%s1? I wouldn't settle for something like that. Better prizes await!|

60678|#823$#%s1? Wow! Today's your lucky day, apparently! Keep trying and I bet you'll get something even better!|
60679|#823$#%s1? Wow! Today's your lucky day, apparently! Keep trying and I bet you'll get something even better!|
60680|#823$#%s1?! O... M... G! Am I dreaming? I still can't believe it!|
60681|#822$#Oh? You won %s1? I've had my eyes on that for some time. You'll let me have it, won't you?|
60682|#822$#%s1? That's pretty nice. But... You can do better, can't you?|
60683|#822$#%s1? That's pretty nice. But... You can do better, can't you?|
60684|#822$#%s1? That's pretty nice. But... You can do better, can't you?|
60685|#823$#%s1? Impressive! Since you're on a hot streak, why don't you keep going? I'll be rooting for you!|
60686|#823$#%s1? Impressive! Since you're on a hot streak, why don't you keep going? I'll be rooting for you!|
60687|#823$#%s1? Impressive! Since you're on a hot streak, why don't you keep going? I'll be rooting for you!|
60688|#823$#Yay! %s1? That's super rare! If anyone deserves that, it's you! You're the best!|
60689|#821$#%s1? That's kinda boring, dontcha think? Seriously, keep trying and get me something cool.|
60690|#822$#%s1? Don't tell me you're just going to call it a day now! You could get something way better.|
60691|#822$#%s1? Don't tell me you're just going to call it a day now! You could get something way better.|
60692|#822$#%s1? Don't tell me you're just going to call it a day now! You could get something way better.|
60693|#822$#Congrats! %s1... You'd never have gotten something that rare without my help!|
60694|#822$#Congrats! %s1... You'd never have gotten something that rare without my help!|
60695|#822$#Congrats! %s1... You'd never have gotten something that rare without my help!|
60696|#823$#%s1? I can't believe you actually managed to score something like that! I'm not being sarcastic, either!|
62501|Am I doing well?|
62502|Do you remember that time we fought %s2?|
62503|Did you get hurt in a recent battle?|
62504|How do you feel when you defeat an enemy?|
62505|What do you think of our tactics?|
62506|#821$#I've been watching you beat up on one %s2 after another.
#822$#It's pretty obvious that you've gotten a lot stronger.|
62507|#821$#Oh, you were brilliant in that fight against %s2!
#822$#I can remember the whole thing very clearly.|
62508|#824$#I got myself a pickle when I let %s2 get in behind me.
#821$#But thanks to you, I turned out just fine!|
62509|#821$#With victory should come a bit of pride! Why not?
#823$#I noticed that proud look you had when you handed %s2 a beatdown.|
62510|#822$#Oh, yes, it's all down to tactics. That and our ability to coordinate.
#821$#Just look what happens when we use our Combo Attack. Nothing stands a chance!|
62511|How am I doing out there?|
62512|%s2 doesn't bother you at all, do they?|
62513|What's the difference between you and I in terms of strength?|
62514|Can we spar sometime?|
62515|How did I do when we fought %s2?|
62516|#821$#Very well, I'd say! I barely had to help out at all against %s2.
#822$#It makes me feel confident to fight alongside you.|
62517|#821$#Bah! %s2 is no challenge at all.
#822$#We should be going after bigger marks!|
62518|#821$#Ha! You've still got a ways to go!
#823$#But you are coming up fast. I don't think it will take you very long to match me.|
62519|#821$#Perhaps! I wouldn't want to hurt you, though.
#823$#Ha ha! Just kidding!|
62520|#821$#Fabulously well! I was impressed.
#822$#%s2 could barely touch you!|
62521|How do you think the battle with %s2 went?|
62522|Do you have any tips for fighting %s2?|
62523|What's that you're writing? Is it a diary?|
62524|How is our Combo Skill coming along?|
62525|How can I become a better fighter?|
62526|#821$#You tore through a huge group of %s2 not too long ago.
#822$#I was super impressed!|
62527|#822$#Even though %s2 isn't much of a threat, you can't forget about them entirely.
#821$#Never hurts to be careful!|
62528|#821$#...huh?
#822$#Oh! Oh, nothing. I was just, um, writing down... Your battle records!
#823$#According to this, you've fought... um... A billion %s2! Nice job!|
62529|#822$#You mean our Super Synchronized Transcendental Combo Version 2.718?
#821$#It's unstoppable! We tore through a whole pack of %s2 with it.|
62530|#822$#Just keep going the way you are going!
#821$#You keep getting tougher every day.|
62531|Why were you smiling when we fought %s2?|
62532|Are you avoiding me?|
62533|Did you get hurt in that fight with %s2?|
62534|Why so serious?|
62535|You look bored.|
62536|#821$#Because I was impressed!
#823$#You tore through %s2 like it was nothing! How could I not crack a smile?|
62537|#821$#I dunno... That look you had on your face as you tore through %s2...
#824$#Do you have a ruthless side to you?|
62538|#824$#Nothing serious. Just a few broken bones, some internal bleeding, and a partially barfed-up heart.
#822$#Ha! Just kidding. Do you really think a mere %s2 can hurt me?|
62539|#821$#Oh I was just reminiscing on how quickly you tore through %s2...
#822$#Are you going to do that again? Or are we moving on to bigger baddies?|
62540|#824$#Yep. Fighting these puny enemies is dull as dishwater.
#821$#Let's go find a real challenge!|
62541|Is it just me, or have things been kind of dull lately?|
62542|What do you think of our Combo Attack?|
62543|We seem to be working together well.|
62544|What's up? You seem extra cheerful today.|
62545|Do you remember that time we fought %s2?|
62546|#822$#To you, maybe. To me, just being alive is an adventure!
#821$#That being said, it does get kind of boring to fight so many %s2... Maybe we could switch it up.|
62547|#822$#Yes! By our powers combined, we can defeat any foe!
#821$#...what? Was that over the top?|
62548|#821$#I completely agree!
#822$#Our teamwork is evident when we mop up %s2 by the dozen.|
62549|#821$#I do? I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary.
#822$#I just can't help but be in a good mood when I see you getting stronger day by day.|
62550|#821$#Of course I do! That was a scrap for the history books!
#822$#We should go find an even bigger baddie to take down.|
62551|Why are you staring at me? Is there something on my face?|
62552|How do you feel about our tactics?|
62553|Hang on a second, I think I need a rest.|
62554|How do you think I did against %s2?|
62555|What's wrong? Are you feeling okay?|
62556|#823$#Oh, no, nothing like that.  I was just wondering...
#823$#You're really strong, but you're so skinny! Where does it all come from?|
62557|#823$#Wait... We have tactics? I've just been charging in headlong and beating up the nearest monster!
#821$#I supose that's technically a tactic...|
62558|#822$#Chin up! Everyone gets tired after a while.
#821$#Take a minute to collect yourself if you need to, then let's get back at it!|
62559|#822$Against %s2 you showed a ton of potential.
#821$Keep training, and pretty soon you'll be unstoppable!|
62560|#824$#Hmph! No. Frustrated. I wasn't really at my best in that fight against %s2.
#821$#You totally showed me up! ARGH!|
62561|Why is your face red?|
62562|What's on your mind?|
62563|What should we do if we get separated in a battle?|
62564|We're friends, right?|
62565|What are you counting up?|
62566|#823$#Oh, I'm just a little flushed. It must be... yeah, that fight with %s2. That's it. Sure.|
62567|#821$#You know, there's a lot more to do than just fight all the time.
#822$#I know! Let's go to Navea and check out the Auction House!|
62568|#822$#You don't need to worry about me. Remember when I took down %s2 all on my own?
#821$#The question is, how will you fare without me?|
62569|#821$#Not just friends! We're friends, partners, confidants, everything!
#823$#Well, maybe not everything... But darn close to it!|
62570|#821$#I'm trying to count up all the %s2 that we've taken down recently!
#822$#Oh no! I don't have enough fingers!|
62571|What do you think of my performance?|
62572|Why are you always staring at me?|
62573|What's with the ultra-serious look?|
62574|Sup? Are you feeling alright?|
62575|Thanks for all the help!|
62576|#824$#Ehhh... It's okay...
#821$#If you want to get better, go destroy a million %s2 with one hand tied behind your back.
#823$#Then do it again with the other hand!|
62577|#823$#Do you think I'm deliberately trying to distract you while you are fighting?
#821$#Perhaps I am. You'll never know.|
62578|#821$#Serious? No, this is my contented expression.
#823$#I enjoy watching you continue to thrash helpless creatures. Keep it up.|
62579|#824$#(Yawn) This is getting boring. Where is the challenge here?
#821$#We should move on to a tougher zone.|
62580|#821$#I help if I must. It'd be a shame if you died and I had to find someone else to pester.
#823$#But it does make me glad you realize that you don't stand a chance without me.|
62581|Do I look cool when I'm fighting %s2?|
62582|What's up with %s2? They seem mysterious...|
62583|How did you feel when we beat %s2?|
62584|Do you think about prior battles often?|
62585|What do you think about our Combo Attack?|
62586|#821$#Eh... It's hard to look cool when you're fighting a namby-pamby like %s2.
#822$#You need to go after some tougher mobs to really impress people!|
62587|#822$#Huh. I wonder what sort of secrets %s2 could be hiding...
#822$#There has to be something going on. How else could they have gotten so powerful?|
62588|#822$#Heroic! You have to face down huge challenges in order to be called a hero.
#821$#The fight against %s2 was certainly that!|
62589|#821$#All the time!
#822$#Take the fight with %s2 for example. It was brilliant!
#824$#We executed perfectly. Even the slightest mistake would have cost us our lives!|
62590|#822$#Have you heard that phrase 'greater than the sum of its parts?'
#821$#When you put the two of us together, we can take on any challenge!|
62591|Do you think I'm good at battling %s2?|
62592|Let's go challenge %s2!|
62593|Do you think %s2 is tough?|
62594|Do you think about that battle against %s2 a lot?|
62595|Have any of our recent battles left you with a strong impression?|
62596|#821$#That fancy move you used to finish off %s2 was amazing!
#822$#I couldn't help but admire it.|
62597|#822$#Why? %s2 is not even a challenge to us.
#821$#Let's go hunt down some tougher enemies!|
62598|#823$#%s2? Bah! I could handle a hundred of them without breaking a sweat.|
62599|#822$#Yes, I think about that more often than I'd care to admit.
#821$#Hm... I suppose that's sort of admitting it, isn't it?  Oh well.|
62600|#821$#You bet! I remember our duel with %s2!
#823$#Action! Drama! Intrigue! It had everything!|
62601|Can we learn from our enemies?|
62602|Does %s2 have a weakness?|
62603|I feel like I've hit a bottleneck...|
62604|You seem different after the battle with %s2.|
62605|How do you get over your frustrations?|
62606|#823$#Of course! 'Know Thine Enemy,' is a common phrase in war.
#822$#By studying your enemy, you can easily understand how to defeat them.|
62607|#822$#You've already faced down %s2 and won... Shouldn't you already know its weakness?
#821$#Or did you do it the hard way?|
62608|#821$#Chin up! You're still alive and you're stronger than you once were.
#822$#Where would you be if you gave up at the very first setback?|
62609|#821$#Oh, %s2. I was certainly lucky that you had my back!
#823$#If I was with anyone else, I might not be around to have this conversation.|
62610|#822$#Frustrations are a part of life. We all deal with them.
#821$#Everyone is different, but you can try thinking of things that have gone well. The battle with %s2, for example.|
62611|Hey! Why are you laughing at me?|
62612|Do remember the time we fought %s2?|
62613|What do you feel like doing?|
62614|What's the secret to success?|
62615|Let's go take on %s2!|
62616|#821$#Ha! No, I wasn't laughing at you.
#823$#I was just remembering something funny from the other day...|
62617|#821$#I remember it vividly!
#823$#I was impressed that you were able to take on %s2 and win!|
62618|#822$#An excellent question! I have no idea!
#821$#The recent battle with %s2 was a thrill; let's go find an even more ambitious target!|
62619|#821$#Optimism is the key to success! You make your own luck in this world.
#822$#Of course, that luck then gets modified by a pseudorandom number generator...
#823$#...which, in general, follows more of a Gaussian distribution than anything truly random...
#821$#...huh? Nevermind, I'm just rambling.|
62620|#821$#Yes! Let's totally go after %s2... Right after my nap!
#822$#Zzzzzz...|
62621|What? Do I have something on my face?|
62622|I feel like I'm in a funk.|
62623|Something troubling you?|
62624|How can I be the best adventurer ever?|
62625|Are scared of %s2?|
62626|#823$#Huh? Ha, no. I wasn't really staring at you. Just spacing out...|
62627|#822$#It happens. Just keep in mind that a lot of people depend on you.
#821$#Even if it becomes a grind, you have to keep at it! Things will turn up eventually!|
62628|#822$#Not at all! When we took %s2 to school, I noticed a strange power coming from you.
#821$#I wonder if that's when you realized you could be a hero.|
62629|#821$#Success is being prepared!
#822$#An adventurer never knows what's going to come, so they have to be ready for anything!
|
62630|#821$#Scared isn't the right word. Fighting %s2 stresses me out.
#822$#It's always goes down to the wire; one wrong move and we're toast!|
62631|Woo! Wasn't that battle with %s2 exciting?|
62632|We should go challenge %s2.|
62633|Yes! We've defeated %s2!|
62634|Remember when we fought %s2?|
62635|Did you get hurt when we were fighting %s2?|
62636|#823$#Totes! When we put our heads together, nothing can stop us!
#821$#%s2 never stood a chance!|
62637|#821$#Really? %s2 is incredibly strong, and you want to challenge them?
#822$#Looks like you're starting to get ambitious! I like it!|
62638|#822$#Don't lose your head; it's only one battle.
#821$#We still have a long road ahead of us. Keep at it!|
62639|#823$#Oh yeah! The battle against %s2 is something I'll always remember.
#821$#Trading blows! Huge hits and near misses! Just when you think it's all wrapped up, out came something new! It was like a movie!|
62640|#822$#(Sigh) I guess I can't hide it from you, can I?
#824$#Yes, I was careless, and %s2 left me with quite a scar.|
62641|How did I look when I fought %s2?|
62642|Remember that time we battled %s2?|
62643|How are you feeling? Are you up to challenging %s2?|
62644|When was the last time you had this much fun?|
62645|Do you have any tricks for winning battles?|
62646|#821$#You were awesome against %s2!
#822$#I think I got distracted and missed my attack.|
62647|#824$#%s2? I was nervous in that fight. I think I slipped and fell at one point, but no one noticed.|
62648|#823$#Heck yeah! With the two of us together, we can take on anything!|
62649|#822$#It was just the other day!
#821$#We taught %s2 a lesson, remember? Those were good times.|
62650|#822$#Ha! As if I'm going to tell you ALL of my secrets...
#821$#I'm not that easy, you know.|
62651|Did you get hurt when we took on %s2?|
62652|What makes you feel good?|
62653|Do you remember the time we fought %s2?|
62654|So... Have any hobbies?|
62655|You're so strict! Can't we relax once in a while?|
62656|#822$#What? How dare you insinuate such a thing!
821$#How could a meager %s2 have any chance of hurting me?|
62657|#823$#What makes me feel good? Taking my enemies and crushing them into a fine powder.
#821$#If you've no better ideas, as I imagine you don't, I say we do more of that today!|
62658|#822$#Oh, that adorable little %s2 was trying sooo hard to attack me...
#823$#You finished it off too quickly! Let me have some fun with it next time.|
62659|#821$#Hobbies? You mean aside from destroying miserable monsters?
#822$#Oh, I suppose sometimes I like taking our prey and stuffing them.
#823$#I made an adorable doll out of %s2 to put on my mantle!|
62660|#824$#No! You still have so much to learn.
#822$#You face one puny %s2 and you're already panting like a dog!
#823$#I require my servants to be in tip-top condition at all times!|
62661|Whatcha thinking about?|
62662|You look lost in thought...|
62663|Do you remember the treasure we picked up after beating %s2?|
62664|Do you wish you had %s3?|
62665|#821$#%s1 must be really lucky to have gotten %s3 off of %s2.
#822$#I guess there really are rewards for hard work!|
62666|#821$#I'm feeling lucky today! I think we're sure to find %s3 if we challenge %s2!
#823$#Lets go as soon as possible!|
62667|#821$#Oh, that? Absolutely!
#823$#I was surprised that %s2 would be carrying something like %s3. I guess you can't judge a book by its cover!|
62668|#822$#Haha, you really recognize it.
#821$# I've always wanted to have %s3! %s1, when you finally got it, I was so happy!|
62669|Is there anything you'd like to ask me?|
62670|%s3 is nice... I wish I had more!|
62671|What do you think... Is it time to update my wardrobe?|
62672|What should we do today?|
62673|#824$#Hm? Oh, nothing important.
#822$#I was just curious what you planned to do with %s3.
#821$#It's so valuable, I can't imagine actually using it.|
62674|#821$#It is, isn't it? But we can't always be that lucky.
#822$#I guess if you've got nothing but free time, we could hunt down %s2 and see if we can get one.|
62675|#821$#Fashion is important, I suppose. But so is function!
#822$#Maybe you should check out some new gear, like the %s3 we picked up from %s2.|
62676|#821$#Ugh, I've been feeling lethargic lately. I need to get my blood moving!
#823$#I know! We should go challenge %s2 again! Good exercise and a shot at getting another %s3!|
62677|Do you know how I could get my hands on %s3?|
62678|I'm glad you're here! I couldn't have picked up %s3 without your help.|
62679|What's that book you're looking at?|
62680|How come you keep staring at %s3?|
62681|#821$#Your best bet at getting %s3 is to go after %s2.
#822$#It could take a while, so let's get to it!|
62682|#823$#Aww, you and your flattery...
#821$#No, but seriously... You had as much to do with it as I did. If not more...|
62683|#821$#Oh, this? I was just doing some research. I think a friend of yours just picked up a fancy brand-new %s3.
#822$#Apparently they got it from %s2; maybe we should challenge them as well?|
62684|#822$#This is %s3? I'd thought it would have been bigger and shinier.
#821$#I wouldn't have even thought this was valuable if you hadn't said so.|
62685|You seem upset. What's up?|
62686|What happened that made you so happy? Did you win the lottery or something?|
62687|How come you stare at %s2 whenever we come across them?|
62688|So, I take it you like that %s3...|
62689|#824$#(Sigh) It's been too long since we've found a truly awesome treasure.
#822$#Remember when we found %s3? What a day that was!|
62690|#821$#I just found out that the %s3 a friend of yours picked up is ridiculously valuable.
#822$#Now I want one! Let's track down %s2 and make them cough one up!|
62691|#821$#Oh, was I staring? Sorry! It's just weird to me that something like %s2 would be carrying a %s3...
#821$#Now I'm curious as to what else they have on them.|
62692|#823$#Yes! I'm totally jelly that everyone seems to have a %s3 now.
#821$#I want one of my own!|
62693|What's so special about %s2?|
62694|Do you know how I can get %s3?|
62695|Do you have any tips for going through dungeons?|
62696|Is there something you want?|
62697|#821$#You mean besides the metric ton of XP that %s2 doles out? I think they can also drop %s3!|
62698|#822$#%s2!
#821$#Everyone I know who's gotten %s3 has picked it up from %s2.|
62699|#822$#If you're having trouble getting deep into a tough dungeon, it can help to fortify your gear.
#821$#Of course, you'll find new gear in the dungeon, which then needs to be fortified for the NEXT dungeon, where you find even newer gear...
#824$#It's a neverending cycle!|
62700|#821$#Yes! That %s3 that you picked up recently.
#822$#I want like twenty of those things. They're incredible!|
62701|%s3 is awesome! I want another one!|
62702|Huh. What am I supposed to do with another %s3?|
62703|What's the quickest way to getting stronger?|
62704|Wow! A %s3? It must be our lucky day!|
62705|#821$#Go knock %s2 around again if you want %s3!
#822$#That's where we got it last time, right?|
62706|#822$#%s3 is a valuable piece of gear. If you don't want it, I'm sure a friend of yours can put it to good use.
#821$#If not, there's always the Auction House!|
62707|#824$#An excellent question! I just saw this AuraTube video about a piece of gear that raises your level automatically!
#821$#The comments section was full of people saying it was a scam, but what do they know?|
62708|#822$#Luck? You can call it luck if you want. I prefer to call it DESTINY. Yes, in all caps.
#821$#DESTINY is what brought %s3 to you. You should thank DESTINY.|
62709|Why are you laughing? Did something funny happen?|
62710|What's on the docket for today?|
62711|My gear is starting to get stale. Let's head to the shop!|
62712|I'm feeling generous today. Is there anything you want from the store?|
62713|#822$#Ha! I'm laughing because we keep getting tons of %s3 from %s2!
#821$#We're in the money big time!|
62714|#821$#I was going to suggest that we hunt down %s2.
#822$#I heard you can sometimes get a super-valuable %s3 from them! Ka-ching!|
62715|#821$#Buying better gear is important, but so is being thrifty.
#822$#A lot of good stuff can be found just lying about, like that %s3 you picked up recently.
#823$#And remember: every piece of gold saved is a piece of gold that can be spent spoiling your favorite Eidolon!
$822$#What? YES, OF COURSE I MEANT ME!|
62716|#823$#Aww, thanks hun!
#821$#That %s3 you picked up recently looks pretty snazzy. Can I have one of those?|
62717|Everything seems to have gotten more expensive lately...|
62718|Do you know how to get %s3?|
62719|Time to get rid of some old equipment!|
62720|Did you need something? I thought I heard you say my name...|
62721|#821$#Is that it? I thought you'd been scrimping on dinner lately!
#824$#Ugh! I can't stand being poor! Quick, go sell everything you own! I require filet mignon!|
62722|#824$#Yikes! You forgot already? Can you even remember your own name?
#821$#You get %s3 from %s2, remember? How many times must I remind you?|
62723|#824$#I didn't want to say anything, but they are starting to look pretty tattered...
#822$#Wait... What's that you're putting on? Where did that come from?
#821$#Did you find a rare piece of gear and not tell me about it? How dare you!|
62724|#822$#...yes, with the money I filch from this clueless Envoy, I can certainly buy a new...
#824$#Huh? You! How dare you eavesdrop on me! I'm busy scheming over here!
#823$#Scheming? No! I meant, um, screaming. Yes! I'm busy SCREAMING! EVERYTHING'S FINE! GO AWAY!|
62725|I don't remember anything after we encountered %s2. What happened?|
62726|Is there anything I should know about %s3?|
62727|#824$#You went down like a ton of bricks! I was worried...
#821$#Luckily %s2 lumbered off after that, and I was able to bring you to a doctor.|
62728|#821$#%s3 is a dangerous place because %s2 roams around. They got the better of you last time!|
62729|I can't believe I let %s2 get the better of me! This sucks...|
62730|I'm glad you were there to help last time...|
62731|#821$#Cheer up! It's not that big of a deal.
#822$#So what if %s2 rang your bell? You're still alive, and you can show them what's for next time!|
62732|#824$#You bit off more than you could chew, didn't you?
#821$#It's okay. We're here to watch one another's backs, right? So it's as much my fault as it is yours...|
62733|What's with all those bandages?|
62734|Oh, wow, I feel like a chump after what happened in %s3...|
62735|#821$#Oh these? It never hurts to be prepared!
#822$#Better to have and not need, than need and not have.|
62736|#822$#Don't let it get you down. %s3 was just a temporary setback.
#822$#Let's train up a bit, then challenge %s2 again!|
62737|Losing sucks! How can I make that happen less often?|
62738|What happened after I went down in %s3?|
62739|#821$#Remember that there is no shame in running from a battle you can't win.|
62740|#824$#You went face-first into the dirt!
#822$#I got so filthy carrying you back to town... That was humiliating!|
62741|Hey, thanks for being there to help out...|
62742|What happened to us at %s3? I can't seem to remember...|
62743|#821$#Sure! We are partners, right? We should have each other's backs.
#822$#Just try and be more careful next time. %s2 is no pushover.|
62744|#821$#What happened is that you got your head handed to you by %s2!
#824$#%s3 is a dangerous place. We should make sure we're prepared before we go back.|
62745|I'm a little down on myself after losing to %s2...|
62746|It's my fault we lost against %s2. I dragged us down...|
62747|#821$#Hey, it's cool. Can't win them all!
#822$#I'm sure you'll do much better against %s2 next time.|
62748|#822$#Don't feel bad; it's as much my fault as it is yours!
#824$#I should have been paying more attention, and I let an enemy get in behind you.|
62749|Let's go see what there is to find in %s3.|
62750|I'm glad you had my back last time!|
62751|#821$#Dude! You need to be careful when you're traipsing around %s3!
#822$#I'd hate to see you get knocked out... again...|
62752|#823$#You betcha! That's why I'm here, right?
#822$#Of course, it'd be nice if you didn't need me to bail you out so often...|
62753|What happened when we were in %s3? I don't remember anything...|
62754|I'm glad you were there last time...|
62755|#821$#Looks like you need to do a bit more training, wouldn't you say?
#824$#You let %s2 get right on top of you!|
62756|#821$#You have to keep your wits about you when you're wandering through %s3.
#824$#I don't want to have to find myself a new servant!|
62757|Bah! Taking out %s2 was childs play!|
62758|That was it? %s2 was kind of boring...|
62759|I know everything there is to know about %s2!|
62760|#821$#Yeah! I feel like I could take on a dozen of those guys by myself!|
62761|#823$#%s2 really isn't a challenge anymore... Should we go find some tougher enemies to fight?|
62762|#823$#Wow! You tore through them like a hot knife through butter!
#822$#Huh... That's a weird expression. Do some people actually keep their knives hot?
#824$#Conversely, does that mean that other people would chill their knives? Ahh! Why am I thinking about this?|
62763|That fight against %s2 was kind of rough.|
62764|Am I missing something? Is there a better way to deal with %s2?|
62765|Do you have any hints on how to take on %s2?|
62766|#823$#MOAR POWER, MOAR DAMAGE!
#821$#Sorry... I got carried away for a moment. Yeah... Um, it never hurts to upgrade your weapon!|
62767|#824$#You should hop over to the Secret Stone Merchant and do some inlaying! That could give you the boost you need to handle %s2.|
62768|#821$#When all else fails, there is always the long, slow grind for XP! It's a sure-fire way to level you up... eventually!|
62769|I know %s3 like the back of my hand!|
62770|Man... We mobbed through %s3 like it was nothing!|
62771|I feel like we combed through every nook and cranny of %s3.|
62772|#821$#Yup! I'd say we're pretty familiar with %s3 these days.
#823$#It's starting to feel like a second home to me...|
62773|#821$#Darn skippy! %s3 is nothing to fear.
#823$#I'm thinking of getting a summer home there.|
62774|#821$#All those baddies wandering around are no match for us!
#823$#Traveling across %s3 is like a walk in the park.|
62775|Do you have any tips on how to handle the dangers in %s3?|
62776|This jaunt through %s3 is starting to stress me out...|
62777|Am I missing something? Is there an easier way to handle %s3?|
62778|#822$#Maybe it's time to upgrade your gear.
#821$#You can look for some new stuff, or fortify what you've got.|
62779|#822$#You were almost there! I'm sure it'll be fine next time.|
62780|#821$#Have you given some thought to reallocating your skill points? Maybe a tweak in your setup is all you need.|
62781|Who'd win in a fight: me or %s2?|
62782|I feel really strong lately!|
62783|What do you think of %s2?|
62784|#821$#Pshaw! As if %s2 even stands a chance!
#823$#You'd mop the floor with them!|
62785|#822$#Funny, I was just thinking the same thing!
#823$#I think that fight against %s2 really boosted our confidence!|
62786|#822$#(Yawn) Bo-o-oring! Let's try and find an actual challenge!|
62787|That fight against %s2 was epic!|
62788|What do you say? Should we go train today?|
62789|What's the secret to beating %s2?|
62790|#822$#Yeah, if by 'epic' you mean 'took way longer than it should have.'
#821$#You need a bit of work if you want to win by more than the skin of your teeth!|
62791|#823$#Yes! Let's toughen up a bit so that next time we come across %s2 it'll be a breeze!|
62792|#822$#You're asking the right person! I'm full of advice that'd be mildly useful if it wasn't so vague!
#823$#Deal lots of damage while avoiding or deflecting %s2's big attacks. You see? No problem at all!|
62793|Should we keep fighting %s2?|
62794|%s3 seems like a nice place...|
62795|Fighting %s2 is fun!|
62796|#823$#If you really want to, I suppose...
#823$#But I could beat twenty of them in my sleep! Shouldn't we find some tougher enemies?|
62797|#822$#Really? You think so? To each their own, I guess...
#823$#Wait, was that sarcasm? Ha! I get it!|
62798|#823$#There is something really satisfying about beating up on %s2...|
62799|I'm having a tough time making my way through %s3...|
62800|No one else has trouble with %s2... What's wrong with me?|
62801|Is there an easier way through %s3?|
62802|#824$#You might be just having an off day.
#822$#Maybe give it a rest for a while, and then get back at it!|
62803|#822$#Don't get so down; %s2 has gotta have a weak spot.
#823$#Maybe you should ask one of those other adventurers for advice!|
62804|#824$#Hmm... not that I know of. You may just need to gain a level or two before you give it another go.|
62805|What's on your mind?|
62806|Ha! %s2 is no match for our mightiness!|
62807|I think I'm getting familiar with %s2's fighting style.|
62808|#822$#Oh, not much. Just thinking...
#821$#Actually, I'm curious as to why you're spending so much time fighting %s2. Do they drop some good loot or something?|
62809|#823$#No match whatsoever! Our mightiness is just so... mighty!|
62810|#821$#Familiar? More like omniscient!
#823$#It looks like you know what %s2 is about to do before even they do!|
62811|%s2 was really strong.|
62812|Is there a better way to deal with %s2?|
62813|Is there any hope of beating %s2?|
62814|#822$#Ugh. Yeah. That was tougher than I expected.
#821$#We'll have to brush up our skills if we want to face %s2 again.|
62815|#824$#There has to be! I'm just not sure what it is...|
62816|#822$#The Secret Stone Merchant in town should be able to help tune up your equipment. Support local businesses!|
62817|%s2 is no threat to me!|
62818|Do you think I've gotten stronger?|
62819|It was really easy to tear through %s3.|
62820|#821$#Get your head out of the clouds; it was just %s2!
#822$#It's time to move on to some bigger and badder opponents.|
62821|#821$#I'd say so! You're starting to live up to your potential.
#822$#It wasn't so long ago that you were just a whelp, and now look at you!|
62822|#821$#%s3 just isn't a challenge these days.
#822$#We should take on some tougher dungeons!|
62823|Do you have any tips for making our way through %s3?|
62824|What's up? Want to chat?|
62825|Is there an easier way to get through %s3?|
62826|#822$#You ran into a rough patch. So what? It's not a big deal.
#821$#You'll pull through next time, I'm sure of it!|
62827|#821$#Yeah. I want to ask you something...
#822$#It took you forever to deal with %s2! What's up? Are you feeling okay?|
62828|#821$#%s3 is a strange and dangerous place. Make sure %s2 doesn't back you into a corner!|
62829|Fighting %s2 seems a little too easy...|
62830|Are we being cruel by beating up on %s2?|
62831|I'm in the zone fighting one %s2 after another.|
62832|#821$#It doesn't just seem like it!
#823$#%s2 is so easy, it's a waste of time! Let's go fight tougher monsters!|
62833|#823$#Cruel? Not if %s2 has awesome loot that we need!|
62834|#822$#You could be in the zone, or you could be stuck in a rut.
#827$#You should switch it up and go after something other than %s2!|
62835|That battle against %s2 was a thrill!|
62836|That battle against %s2 was stressful!|
62837|%s2 was super-tough!|
62838|#824$#Um... really? I thought it was way too easy.|
62839|#824$#If %s2 is too much for you, try swapping out some Masteries. You might find a killer combination!|
62840|#822$#Don't get so down! It's only %s2.
#821$#Before you know it you'll have defeated a hundred of them like it's nothing!|
62841|Do you think I'm getting more skilled?|
62842|It seems like we've been doing the same thing over and over...|
62843|You and I are unstoppable!|
62844|#823$#More skilled? Perhaps. You are definitely learning to use the skills you already have very efficiently.|
62845|#821$#Yeah. We have. It's called %s3.
#822$#We should check out some other dungeons!|
62846|#821$#Dude I know!
#823$#Not even %s2 stood a chance against our collective awesomeness!|
62847|I barely made a dent in %s2!|
62848|Is there something I'm missing when it comes to %s2?|
62849|It's really tough to dodge %s2's special attacks...|
62850|#824$#I'll say! With that puny weapon, it's like attacking a tank with a toothpick!
#821$#Maybe you should pay a visit to the weapon shop.|
62851|#822$#Have you looked to see if %s2 has an elemental type? There might be a weakness you can target...|
62852|#824$#Jack be nimble, Jack be... not dead!|
62853|Do you think I'm getting stronger?|
62854|I've got %s2's moves down cold!|
62855|Anyone can do anything! It just takes practice, right?|
62856|#821$#You know, I had my doubts when I first met you.
#822$#You had potential, but you were soft. Now, you're tough enough that you can even beat %s2!|
62857|#822$#You had better, after fighting a million of them!
#823$#%s2 no challenge anymore. Let's find a new target!|
62858|#821$#I think that's what they tell children in school. But some people are certainly better at things than others.
#823$#Take me, for example. I'm terrible at physics!|
62859|%s2 is always a challenge for me. Am I doing something wrong?|
62860|We should be strong enough to beat %s2, right?|
62861|Is there a better way to take down %s2?|
62862|#821$#Baby steps! If you're having trouble with %s2, then you need to take it slow.
#822$#Get some experience, get some new gear, and then go back to it!|
62863|#821$#We should be, yes, but %s2 can be unpredictable.
#822$#Let's stock up on health potions before picking a fight.|
62864|#822$#Two words: fortification! No, crap, that's just one word...|
62865|Going through %s3 just doesn't feel the same anymore...|
62866|That was the easiest run yet through %s3!|
62867|What are you thinking about?|
62868|#823$#That's because you've gotten stronger! %s3 no longer poses a challenge. We should look for a new dungeon to crawl through!|
62869|#821$#It was a breeze! I almost fell asleep halfway through.
#823$#Let's take on something even tougher than %s3 next time!|
62870|#821$#Ponies!
#822$#No, I don't even really know what I was thinking about. I was spacing out.|
62871|Can you give me any tips on dealing with %s3.|
62872|Is there a way to defeat %s2 faster?|
62873|%s3 stresses me out a bit!|
62874|#821$#Simple: be prepared!
#822$#That means improving your gear and stocking up on health potions before setting foot inside %s3.|
62875|#822$#How did that old story go? The tortoise and the hare, and some guy named Zeno...
#821$#No, I'm getting my stories crossed up. The point is, have patience! Who cares if it takes a long time, so long as you win?|
62876|#821$#Maybe you should focus on something else for a while.
#822$#When you come back to %s3, it'll be a breeze!|
62877|This is getting easier. My skills must be improving!|
62878|What do you think about %s2?|
62879|How would you rate my performance?|
62880|#823$#You get better when you push yourself! Now that %s2 isn't challenging anymore, you should find some tougher enemies.|
62881|#823$#Weak! Pathetic! %s2 isn't even worth the time of day anymore!
#821$#I bet %s2 would keel over if you gave it a stern glare.|
62882|#821$#Super-rad! Yes, that is a technical term.
#823$#No, seriously. The way you took down %s2 was incredible!|
62883|(Yawn) I'm getting sleepy...|
62884|%s2 nearly got the better of us...|
62885|What can we do about %s2?|
62886|#822$#Oh, is it naptime already?|
62887|#822$#Taking a run at %s2 right now might have been ambitious.
#821$#Luckily we got through with our necks intact.|
62888|#821$#If something isn't working, change it up! With skills and Masteries and the Envoy's Path, you have like a billion ways to kit yourself out.|
62889|Do you have any tips for tackling %s3?|
62890|Over already? %s3 was barely a challenge.|
62891|What's the key to victory?|
62892|#822$#I think you're on the right track.
#821$#You might want to give your gear a once-over, maybe fortify some stuff, but I think you'll be fine.|
62893|#821$#True! I hardly broke a sweat.
#823$#We should test our mettle in a tougher dungeon!|
62894|#821$#Confidence! It's amazing what a little self-confidence can do.
#823$#You see how we took down %s2? They must have had no confidence whatsoever.|
62895|What's with all the staring?|
62896|Why does %s2 give me such trouble? No one else seems to have a problem...|
62897|That run through %s3 was tough!|
62898|#821$#Oh, sorry! I was spacing out.
#822$#I was actually reminiscing about that fight with %s2... That was crazy!|
62899|#822$#As I always say... When in doubt, just put your head down and charge forward blindly!
#823$#Ha ha! No, I'm kidding, please don't actually do that.|
62900|#821$#Getting through %s3 was one heck of a task!
#822$#We might want to prepare a bit better if we choose to tackle it again.|
62901|It's pretty easy to take out %s2.|
62902|Is there a place for me in your heart?|
62903|Thinking about beating %s2 gets me all revved up!|
62904|#821$# It was so cool when you defeated %s2.
#823$# That's the kind of think they should adapt into a play!|
62905|#822$# Whenever I look at you,
#823$# I really feel like I joined up with the right person.|
62906|#821$# Let's find ourselves some new opponents.
#824$# I'm totally bored with beating up %s2 all the time.|
62907|Woooooo...I'm feeling a little dizzy...|
62908|Why is this %s2 so obstinate?|
62909|Okay, show me how you'd defeat %s2!|
62910|#822$# What's up? Is there a lingering effect from %s2's attacks?
#821$# Come here and lie down; I'll take a look at you.|
62911|#821$# Did they become stronger, or are you slipping a bit?
#824$# Maybe we need to make sure you're getting a full night's sleep.|
62912|#821$# Fortifying equipment is a nice, direct way to rachet up your power.
#822$# If you invest now, it'll pay handsomely later on the battlefield.|
62913|I'm all too happy to raid %s3 with you.|
62914|It's so easy to conquer %s3.|
62915|Do you like me?|
62916|#823$# I hope you'll always remember how we busted up %s3!|
62917|#821$# You should teach a school course on "How to Raid %s3".
#823$# After all, everyone could use a few pointers.|
62918|#821$# Ever since you beat %s2, 
#823$# I've felt like I made out pretty well, picking you as my partner.|
62919|%s2's power is incredibly strong...|
62920|You seem to be in a bad mood. What's up?|
62921|Why the long face?|
62922|#822$# %s2 from %s3 is really unnerving...
#824$# I can't help but hesitate for a moment when I see them.|
62923|#821$# You should take me out to see the sights sometime, or maybe a night on the town.
#824$# I could use a change of scenery, after looking at %s3 for so long.|
62924|#821$# It's... it's because of me, to leave you trembling with fear in front of %s2...
#824$# I will work harder next time...|
62925|I looked rather dashing when we fought %s2, right?|
62926|The battle with %s2 got me all fired up!|
62927|%s2 is beneath my concern.|
62928|#821$# It feels cheesy saying it, but...
#823$# The way you defeated %s2 was really cool.|
62929|#821$# Not a bad showing!
#823$# When you bested %s2, I was shouting, "Finish them!"|
62930|#822$# Don't pick weak opponents just to look cool.
#821$# Pluck up your courage and fight enemies stronger than %s2!|
62931|Uh-oh, we've got a problem here...|
62932|I've noticed that %s2 isn't always easy to fight.|
62933|I got a real thrill when we battled %s2!|
62934|#821$# Oooof. That wasn't exactly your most graceful fight.
#824$# I almost feel bad for the %s2...|
62935|#824$# If you want to complain, first show your skill.|
62936|#822$# What about the progress from your daily training? Did you know that %s2 was sneering at you?|
62937|It feels fitting to fight alongside you.|
62938|What do you think of %s3?|
62939|%s3 seems too easy for us now!|
62940|#823$# You've made exceptional progress under me.|
62941|#821$# %s3 is a rather lovely place, don't you think?
#823$# Our dungeoneering strategy seems to be working wonders.|
62942|#822$# %s3 is no longer a problem for us.
#821$# Now, let's take on new challenges that cause us some pain!|
62943|Would you care for some guidance on how to improve your attacks?|
62944|How is it that other Eidolons seem to defeat %s2 more easily than me?|
62945|%s3 is giving me a pinch of trouble, admittedly.|
62946|#821$# Pour all of your skill points into DMG. Then, next time we face %s2, pulverize them. 
#822$# Now, don't say I never gave you expert advice!|
62947|#822$# I've explained to you how to conquer %s3. 
#821$# Just check your notes. You ARE writing this down, right?|
62948|#824$# Don't go to %s3 next time. I have tired of watching you struggle to stay alive there.|
62949|Do you think I have the right stuff to be a Guild Master?|
62950|#821$# I've been proud to see %s2 get stronger day by day.
#822$# There's a bright future out there, and with your Guild, you'll definitely find it.|
62951|Do you think I have the right stuff to be a Guild Master?|
62952|#821$# Under your leadership, %s2 has gained more and more renown.
#822$# If you play your cards right, you could take this operation and hit the big time!|
62953|Being a Guild Master really wears me out...|
62954|#821$# Leadership comes with the obligation to aim for the top, for the sake of everyone who relies on you.
#822$# The way will undoubtedly be tough, but I think your leadership will make a difference for %s2.|
62955|Am I qualified to be a Guild Master?|
62956|#821$# Ever since %s2 started following your lead, the atmosphere has become a lot more lively.
#822$# Work together with everyone, and you'll have a happy family you can rely on.|
62957|Do you think I've got the makings of a good Guild Master?|
62958|#821$# You run %s2 quite well.
#822$# If not for your leadership, %s2 might not be the noteworthy Guild that it is.|
62959|Do I make a good Guild Master?|
62960|#823$# Be proud! %s2 has become strong under your astute management.|
62961|Do you think I've got the makings of a great Guild Master?|
62962|#821$# Of course! Everyone looks up to you.
#822$# So, where do I send my application to join %s2?
#823$# Do you sell cookies to fund your raids?|
62963|Am I qualified to be a Guild Master?|
62964|#821$# You're doing as well as can be expected, but...
#823$# Your management style is too lax, I fear. You must consolidate power that none would dare challenge.|
62965|What do you think about the name "%s2?"|
62966|What's your impression of the %s2 Guild?|
62967|#822$# It seems like %s2 is a name that has some kind of special meaning.
#821$# Did you pick this Guild because you like the name?|
62968|#822$# %s2 has a really friendly atmosphere. It seems like a place where you can really grow.|
62969|What do you think about the name "%s2?"|
62970|A-are you crying?|
62971|#821$# Ah, %s2...that guild's name is as a rising star in these lands.
#822$# Are you getting along with your fellow guildmates?|
62972|#822$# P-perish the thought! It's just that, as I've watched you grow in strength with %s2...
#821$# My eyes began to mist up a little.|
62973|I'm trying to get along with everyone in the guild.|
62974|Why are you smiling? Did something good happen?|
62975|#821$# Oh? Did something happen?
#822$# Keep an open channel between you and your fellow guildmates. Communication always helps matters.|
62976|#821$# I just heard some gossip you'll appreciate.
#823$# %s2 is spoken of well in the spirit realm - and spirits are not an easy bunch to please.|
62977|Do you think %s2 is cool?|
62978|What are your impressions of the %s2 Guild?|
62979|#822$# %s2 has a nice atmosphere.
#821$# You've been with %s2 for quite a while - you must feel like you fit in there.|
62980|#822$# You can't expect an accurate assessment from me, as I'm not privy to the guild's daily goings-on.
#821$# But I know that whenever you mention %s2, you're in good spirits. That's a good sign, right?|
62981|I'm boooored. Got any ideas of what to do?|
62982|Maybe I should take up a hobby...|
62983|#822$# Why not try raiding some dungeons with your friends in %s2?
#821$# Friends add color to your life, and that'll keep you from feeling bored.|
62984|#822$# You should get in touch with some of your Guildmates.
#821$# I'm sure they know of some interesting things you could try.|
62985|How do I get along with my guildmates?|
62986|What are your impressions of the %s2 Guild?|
62987|#821$# Have you tried...talking with them? Talking generally helps develop relationships.
#822$# Even Envoys can't read minds, so get out there and get to know others.|
62988|#821$# %s2 is more than simply a guild - it seems to have an element of 'family' about it.
#822$# I believe its other members think likewise.|
62989|Hey, are you upset with me? What did I do?|
62990|You always seem concerned when I talk with my %s2 Guildmates...|
62991|#824$# I feel like lately, you're always chatting with your friends in %s2. When will you make some time for me?|
62992|#824$# I'm always worrying that your guildmates in %s2 will take advantage of your kindness.
#821$# It looks like everything is fine now, but if anyone ever bullies you, you let me know!|
62993|What are your impressions of the %s2 Guild?|
62994|Have you ever talked to anyone from %s2?|
62995|#821$# I must admit, %s2 is not as boring as I expected it to be.
#822$# However, I have yet to determine whether I "like" %s2.|
62996|#823$# The people of %s2 are not bad folk.
#821$# They would make fine soldiers in an army of darkness!|
62997|What's up with our rotten luck lately?|
62998|What's your most prized possession?|
62999|There's some personal stuff going on, and I don't really know who I can talk to about it...|
63000|You've been talkative lately. What's up?|
63001|What should we do today?|
63002|#821$#It seems like %s1 has all the luck! Do they have a better drop rate or something?
#822$#Maybe we should join their party and see if their luck rubs off...|
63003|#821$#Oh, this is going to sound corny, but my most prized 'possessions' are my friends!
#822$#It's one thing to travel around with someone, but it's something else entirely to have someone who understands you.|
63004|#822$#You can talk to your friends! That's why we call them 'friends,' isn't it?
#821$#%s1 seems like the sort who would be there for you when you need it.|
63005|#821$#I've been trying to be more outgoing and talkative. It seems to come so naturally to others...
#822$#Whenever I meet new people, I either clam up entirely or stammer like a lunatic.|
63006|#821$#You've been going at it alone for a while. Maybe today you should call up some friends and team up!|
63007|I always seem to pick up junk that I don't need... Where are all the rare drops?|
63008|Is it lunchtime? What's up with the chopsticks?|
63009|Do you think %s1 is a good friend?|
63010|The weather is pretty crummy today...|
63011|Do you make friends easily?|
63012|#821$#Duh, they're called 'rare drops' for a reason!
#822$#Don't worry so much; you can always hock the stuff you don't need for some extra cash.|
63013|#822$#I was just practicing the secret and forbidden and super-powerful martial art of Chop-Fu!
#821$#No, I'm kidding, I was just hungry.|
63014|#822$#%s1 seems to be loyal and generous. Good qualities to have in a friend!
#821$#But... Oh, this is going to sound rude, but they might need to level up a bit.|
63015|#821$#Well, then let's go indoors! To the dungeons!
#822$#Why don't you invite along %s1?|
63016|#822$#I just speak what's on my mind, but people seem to think that's rude for some reason.|
63017|What's so great about having lots of friends?|
63018|Sometimes I think I should just relax with a good book.|
63019|Slim pickings at the Auction House today...|
63020|I think I'm getting better at diving through dungeons.|
63021|Do you play any sports?|
63022|#823$#Well, the more friends you have...
#821$#The more likely one of them will be online when you need a hand in a tough dungeon!|
63023|#822$#Reading is a great way to spend your spare time.
#821$#And if you're a Sorcerer, you can also toast baddies while you read!|
63024|#821$#Well, not everyone puts their best equipment up for sale.
#823$#Maybe if you do some brown-nosing, your pal %s1 will share some of their top-notch gear!|
63025|#821$#Practice makes perfect, or so they say.
#822$#I noticed that your buddy %s1 was struggling with a dungeon a while back... Maybe you should offer up some tips?|
63026|#823$#Yeah! I was totally playing, um, Roundsportzball the other day...
#822$#And winning! Of course I was winning! Duh!|
63027|I always seem to get lost...|
63028|Are you in a bad mood or something?|
63029|How do I cultivate a sense of humor?|
63030|What's your opinion of %s1?|
63031|I'm famished! Will you make me dinner?|
63032|#821$# If you get lost, go ask %s1.
#823$# Why? They look like they're very good at getting lost, haha.|
63033|#824$#No! Well, maybe... You keep making all sorts of new friends, like %s1...
#822$#How come I don't have any friends? Am I annoying or something?|
63034|#821$#First tip: stop using words like 'cultivate.' There is no humor there whatsoever.
#823$#Once you've excised boring words from your vocabulary... Yeesh! Like 'excise!' What's wrong with me?|
63035|#821$#%s1? They're okay, I guess. I don't have much of an opinion.
#823$#Maybe you should team up for a while so I can psycho-analyze them and give you a full report.|
63036|#821$#What? Why am I the one in charge of making dinner?
#823$#I'm a spiritual being invoked by your connection to Gaia! Why would I know anything about food?|
63037|My Friends List is looking a bit sparse these days...|
63038|How should I allocate these Skill Points?|
63039|Whoa! A letter showed up for you!|
63040|Why doesn't anyone understand me?|
63041|How do I stock up on Loyalty Points?|
63042|#821$#You gotta put yourself out there to meet new people! It can seem scary at times, but it's really not that bad.|
63043|#821$#Maybe you should discuss it with your friends!
#822$#%s1 looks like their Skill Points are pretty well distributed.|
63044|#823$#Look at this! It says I'm the last living relative of a Navean diplomat, making me the sole benefactor of their fortune!
#824$#Dude, I'm gonna be rich! No more instant ramen noodles for me!
#823$#What? You think it's a scam? No way! LAAAAAAME.|
63045|#822$#Awww, chin up!
#821$#You've gotta turn that frown upside-down, y'know? Even %s1 is getting depressed, and they put up with almost anything!|
63046|#821$#Make sure you say 'what up' to your friends when you log in. That'll earn you some Loyalty Points!
#823$#Plus it's a great way to stay in touch with your buddies.|
63047|Do you have many friends?|
63048|Ugh, I keep getting my butt handed to me on the Battlefield...|
63049|You seem pretty sturdy. How can I up my DEF?|
63050|Do you play with dolls?|
63051|How do you sort out an argument?|
63052|#821$#Of course! I'm far more popular than you!
#822$#Like, um... Well, it doesn't really matter who they are, does it?|
63053|#821$#I noticed. And I keep noticing every time it happens.
#822$#Maybe you should team up with someone who complements your skill set. %s1 would be down for a skirmish.|
63054|#823$#Well, my armor is the corporeal manifestation of Gaia's power.
#821$#It's a bit more robust than what you've got on now.
#822$#Maybe it's time to see if the armor shop has anything that'll give you a boost.|
63055|#821$#... Dolls? Where did that come from?
#822$#I'm just going to walk away and pretend you didn't say anything.|
63056|#821$#Unless you lock yourself in the cellar, you're going to come across people you don't always agree with.
#822$#That doesn't make them bad people, though. Just talk to them! Most of the time you can work out your differences.|
63057|Do you think %s1 is a good friend?|
63058|Do you want to make new friends?|
63059|Have you ever lied to me?|
63060|Let's go hit up a dungeon!|
63061|I think I'm getting popular!|
63062|#821$#What do you mean? A good friend to you, or a good friend to me?
#822$#%s1 seems alright, I guess. They're not really my style, but then again I have high standards.|
63063|#821$#Hey! Are you trying to pawn me off on one of your friends?
#824$#That's not cool! Even if %s1 is kinda cute... but that's not the point!|
63064|#824$#No. Nope. Never. Nuh-uh.
#821$#...
#822$#Crap! I can't say it with a straight face!|
63065|#821$#Yeah! Let's go! I'm ready to dive into your dungeon!
#822$#Wait. That came out wrong... Um... Oh nevermind, let's just go.|
63066|#821$#It does seem like you have to scroll your Friends List for a loooong time.
#824$#Just don't ignore me because you're all famous now, okay?|
63067|How do I make more friends?|
63068|I know it seems like I can swim forever with zero effort, but I'm actually really afraid of drowning.|
63069|Are you bored? Let's chat!|
63070|Do you like to sing?|
63071|I look good in this outfit, right?|
63072|#822$#What you need to do is find some really popular people and then stick to them like glue.
#821$#Yeah, just like a remora! Attach your sucker-like jaws to %s1's leg; you'll be popular in no time.|
63073|#821$#Don't worry. If you started to sink, I'd call up %s1 to come save you.
#823$#I would do it myself, but I don't really want to get my outfit wet.|
63074|#824$#Why? You want to talk about nothing again, don't you? Ugh! So needy...
#821$#If you want to have a pointless conversation, go talk to your friend %s1.|
63075|#824$#Of course! I sing all the time! You want me to sing a song for you?
#823$#Hold on, let me get out my glitter microphone... Hey, where are you going?|
63076|#824$#(Sigh) You look, um... unique. Yeaaaah, let's put it like that.
#822$#Take some tips from %s1; they're a pretty sharp dresser!|
63077|What do you think of %s2?|
63078|#823$#With %s2 supporting you, you feel happier and more cheerful every day!
#821$#Don't forget that I'm always supporting you!|
63079|I always feel that you care a lot about me and %s2.|
63080|#823$#I don't know what love is, but to see you and %s2 loving each other makes me feel a bit envious.
#821$#Hahaha! No need to be shy! %s2 is your soulmate, and one to be proud of at that.|
63081|Been with %s2 for a long time...|
63082|#823$#%s1 days have passed, seeing the relationship between you and %s2 getting stronger every day makes me feel a bit envious...
#821$#Of course, it's not just %s2 who protects you. I protect you as well!|
63083|It's like this: %s2 and I...|
63084|#824$#Don't, don't, don't, don't... Please don't just bring up anything regarding %s2, alright?
#821$# I've heard that so often that my head is going to explode.|
63085|Are you looking at %s2? What's on your mind?|
63086|#823$#The way you and %s2 are always there to support eachother... Well, it makes me a little jealous, to be honest.
#821$#I'm a bit embarrassed to always be following you.
#824$#Should I give you two some space from time to time?|
63087|I heard that you have something to tell me and %s2?|
63088|#821$#Among all of the %s1 days that you've been with %s2, which day was the most memorable for you both?
#823$#Hahaha! Shouldn't every day be memorable?|
63089|Why are you always worried whenever I talk to %s2?|
63090|#824$#Humph! You never take notice of me when you're talking to %s2.
#823$#Don't just devote all of your time to %s2. When you've got time, you should talk to me too.|
63091|Why do you always want to follow %s2 and me?|
63092|#822$#I mean, don't get me wrong. It's not like I envy you and %s2's relationship.
#821$#I just... I just wanted to see if you're saying bad things about me behind my back!|

63285|What attacks work best in dungeons?|
63286|How can I improve my win rate on the battlefield?|
63287|Lately, my memory's been kinda fuzzy.|
63288|Level with me here - do you think I'm good-looking?|
63289|How does one become a hero?|
63290|Do you think Zeal is a useful Mastery?|
63291|#821$# Try to use Advanced Masteries.
#822$# For example, the %s2 that you learned is a skill with useful applications in dangerous dungeons.|
63292|#821$# Try different Mastery combinations.
#822$# For example, you've learned %s2 - it's a very practical skill in battlefield matches.|
63293|#824$# Are you going amnesiac on me? This isn't the kind of RPG to go with such a hackneyed plot development!|
63294|#821$# Good looking, bad looking...it's all just a surface distinction. What lies in the heart is more important.
#823$# It's the same with masteries - it's not about how you look when you're using them, but how your skill has allowed you to learn them.|
63295|#821$# No matter what kind of person you want to become, you have to start with self-understanding.
#822$# Reaching out to learn more Masteries and Envoy's Path talents are good ways to shape yourself.|
63296|#821$# Zeal can stir up a person's fighting spirit and make one's blood boil in anticipation of action.
#822$# You'll have a chance of increasing your DMG when attacking, and badly weakening the enemy's fighting power.|
63297|What do you know about the Iron Wall Mastery?|
63298|How can I use %s2 most effectively?|
63299|Will mastering %s2 give me some breathing room in a fight?|
63300|It's weird to say, but I'm really proud of how strong you are!|
63301|How can our fights together be more stylish and cool?|
63302|It seems like lately, I've been achieving new Masteries all over the place.|
63303|#821$# Iron Wall is a Mastery than anyone can find a use for.
#822$# After all, if you crumple like a tissue in the rain, what can you really accomplish?|
63304|#821$# %s2 is a shockingly powerful Mastery.
#823$# The best way to use it is without hesistation, striking down all foes before you.|
63305|#821$# I can see that %s2 has been of great help to you with your life of adventure.
#822$# Teach me about it next time we have a free moment. Close partners share their knowledge, right?|
63306|#821$# I'm glad you know strength when you see it!
#823$# When you become as strong as I am, skills like %s2 become superfluous.|
63307|#821$# You ought to lay hold of some Advanced Masteries.
#823$# Advanced Masteries like %s2, with its power and beauty, will mark you as a rising star of the battlefield.|
63308|#822$# You have to continue practicing skills even after you learn them.
#821$# One has to develop intimate familiarity with their skills to truly be called a master.|
63309|I still don't seem able to understand the nuances of %s2...|
63310|When I run up against a difficult foe, how can I face them?|
63311|%s2 is a Mastery I'm really impressed with.|
63312|What strategies should I follow to stay alive in a dungeon?|
63313|At times, I just feel so ordinary, y'know?|
63314|Do you know much about the Focus Mastery? I've been curious about it.|
63315|#823$# Let's drop the pretenses of humility.
#822$# Your fighting abilities have clearly improved since you learned to use %s2.
#821$# Don't let your pace falter; then you'll be able to use it to even greater effect!|
63316|#822$# When you aren't confident of winning, don't rush your opponent head-on in the battle.
#821$# Try to use %s2 to attack enemies in a roundabout way.|
63317|#823$# You seem to like using %s2 a lot.
#822$# Ever since you mastered %s2, I've seen you use it frequently.
#821$# Any special reason for that?|
63318|#821$# Every dungeon has its own unique monster deployment and mechanisms.
#822$# Try to find the combination of Masteries best suited to the task at hand; that'll make your battle easier.|
63319|#823$# %s1, when you mastered %s2, I saw your body flash with a blinding light.
#821$# Could an ordinary person do that? Would an ordinary person make contracts with spirits? I doubt it.|
63320|#821$# Focus allows the user to concentrate intently, turning all the body's power toward one end.
#822$# In a focused state like that, a fighter is capable of greater-than-normal agility and can hit enemies from unbelievable angles.|
63321|Wooo! I'm just too good sometimes!|
63322|What do I do if I get into a conflict with people?|
63323|How can I best tap my latent potential?|
63324|I think my capabilities have really surged since I started learning more Masteries.|
63325|What happened? Why do you keep shaking your head at me?|
63326|What kind of Mastery do you think Murderous Intent is?|
63327|#822$# It must be because you've mastered %s2.
#821$# Perhaps you've leveraged its strong offensive to become bolder in battle!|
63328|#823$# It's simple. Just use %s2 to bash your opponent so hard that they'll be picking their teeth up off the ground.
#821$# Hahaha, just kidding. Don't go around making unnecessary enemies. The ones you have will be trouble enough.|
63329|#821$# Haven't you mastered %s2, %s1?
#822$# Just follow the impluse %s2 gives you to grow as a fighter.|
63330|#822$# You may use Masteries, but I am a master. How can a skill compare to the assistance I provide?|
63331|#824$# Even though you've mastered %s2, I don't see you using it much.
#821$# If you don't put to use what you've learned, what good is it?|
63332|#822$# Murderous Intent will, of course, increase the flames of fury within you; just aim at the vulnerability of your enemies and attack.
#821$# If you come across opponents you must defeat quickly, put this Mastery to use.|
63333|How do I get a high score on the battlefield?|
63334|What should I do when I'm surrounded by enemies?|
63335|How do I gain the upper hand in battle?|
63336|Have you heard any interesting rumors?|
63337|What do you know about the Divine Power Mastery?|
63338|Creating a personalized combat style is harder than it looks...|
63339|#821$# You can gain the upper hand on the battlefield by utilizing your powerful Masteries.
#822$# You should use %s2 to gradually stack up damage - that'll increase your score.|
63340|#822$# %s2 is a very good skill to use when you're surrounded by enemies.
#821$# Massive destructive power tends to clear an area pretty quickly.|
63341|#822$# As long as you keep one step ahead of your enemy, you'll be able to gain the upper hand in combat.
#821$# Use %s2 more often, %s1; it will help you leverage your natural advantage.|
63342|#823$# You know, it's said that the %s2 Mastery wasn't originally developed for battle.
#821$# The hero who created %s2 apparently invented it mainly to win in competitions.
#822$# Now I'm curious what kind of competition it was...|
63343|#821$# Legends say that ancient heroes who made use of Divine Power were unrivaled in battle.
#822$# They could deal traumatic damage that their enemies seldom recovered from.|
63344|#821$# Mmm... It definitely isn't easy creating a unique combat style...
#822$# Try out different Masteries. Eventually you'll find a combo that just clicks for you.|
63345|Welp, I got owned by that dungeon again.|
63346|What should I do if a battle turns desperate?|
63347|Let's join some battlefield matches later.|
63348|Have you been learning a new Mastery in secret?|
63349|I've picked up a few new Masteries lately, and I'm feelin' proud of myself!|
63350|What do you know about the Break Defense Mastery?|
63351|#824$# Well, you can't say I've held back in giving you tips and tricks.
#821$# Next time, use destructive Masteries to blow them out of the water.
#822$# As long as your strength is far greater than that of your enemies, you'll emerge victorious.|
63352|#822$# When retreat isn't an option, you have to fight your way out!
#821$# If you have a powerful Mastery like %s2, it can save your life at a crucial moment!|
63353|#822$# Maybe we ought to swap notes.
#821$# Remember to use %s2 later - utilize your strength to the fullest!|
63354|#822$# I don't need to learn human Masteries.
#821$# Flailing my arms around would be enough to beat most mortals.|
63355|#821$# You need to fully understand your Masteries. Don't underestimate such potent abilities.|
63356|#822$# When you come across enemies that are very resilient, use the Break Defense Mastery to your advantage.
#823$# The more damage that goes through, the faster the fight will end.|
63357|What happened? Why are you sighing?|
63358|If I'm defeated one day...|
63359|How do I learn an Advanced Mastery?|
63360|What are you doing with that Mastery book for %s2?|
63361|Let's go take a walk in the forest, shall we?|
63362|What kind of Mastery is Vigor?|
63363|#824$# Well, you've become much stronger after learning %s2...
#824$# What if you attract the attention of other Eidolons?|
63364|#821$# You're joking, right?
#822$# As long as you master %s2, no one should be able to strike you down.|
63365|#822$# Some powerful enemies carry Advanced Mastery Books with them.
#821$# If you want to, we can go challenge them!|
63366|#822$# W-wait, it's not what it looks like!
#821$# Maybe we should talk about some of the things YOU read when you think no one is looking¡K|
63367|#822$# That sounds good. It's been a while since we took a walk together.
#821$# You've been polishing your skills so much lately that we haven't had much time to talk.|
63368|#822$# Vigor can energize a person, allowing them to withstand more attacks.
#821$# If you use this Mastery, you'll be able to slug it out with fewer worries!|
63369|How can I become rich?|
63370|I want to leave my mark on the battlefield.|
63371|Is it just me, or have I been kind of a genius lately?|
63372|Whoa! Why'd you suddenly hit me?|
63373|They say that enough practice can smooth out one's flaws.|
63374|Have you ever heard of a Mastery called Organized Sabotage?|
63375|#823$# Ah, the inevitable tug of lucre!
#821$# If you defeat strong enemies while using %s2, you'll be swimming in cash in no time, %s1.|
63376|#824$# You think you're ready for the battlefield with skills like THAT? Learn more Masteries, then we'll see.|
63377|#821$# Hmm... After you learned %s2, your performance did improve.
#824$# I wonder if there's any connection¡K|
63378|#824$# Have you heard of the %s2 Mastery?
#821$# If you'd studied it, you could have dodged that attack easily.|
63379|#822$# You do put forth considerable effort.
#821$# I was surprised that you were able to learn %s2; maybe you're more flexible than I took you for.
#823$# I hope your mind is always open to learning.|
63380|#821$# Organized Sabotage can effectively decrease enemies' offensive power.
#822$# Use this Mastery properly in battle to weaken foes, making them easier to contend with.|
63381|You know, about those potions...|
63382|Sometimes, I'm confused by everything going on in battle...|
63383|What do you think about food?|
63384|What kind of living conditions do you prefer?|
63385|How do I become attractive to the opposite sex?|
63386|I just had a sudden craving for %s2...|
63387|#821$# A small bottle of potion can gradually heal even severe bodily injury
#822$# %s2 is particularly effective; well worth the money.|
63388|#822$# In battle, if you use %s2 in advance, you won't lose your control, even when things get hectic.|
63389|#821$# Delicious food is one of the fringe benefits of travel.
#822$# You can't say your life is well-lived unless you take time to savor your meals.|
63390|#821$# A clean environment and friendly neightbors are important!
#823$# It would be great if there were shops nearby that sold gourmet food like %s2.|
63391|#821$# You must first realize your own value to become attractive to others.
#822$# Try learning to cook! Everyone loves a talented chef, and they're often invited to parties.|
63392|#821$# It looks like we're thinking on the same wavelength!
#823$# Actually, I'd just like to have some %s2!|
63393|Relying on potions to outlast enemies seems kiiiinda cheap...|
63394|You know, about those health potions...|
63395|Why are you coughing all the time?|
63396|What do you think about food?|
63397|I don't have any strength anymore...|
63398|How do you have so much stamina all the time?|
63399|#823$# Haha, don't be shy. Using potions well is its own kind of tactic.|
63400|#821$# I've actually never tried a %s2. Do I really need to?|
63401|#821$# Uh...well... I was eating too fast...
#824$# Can't believe I almost died from a %s2...|
63402|#821$# The martial arts and cooking are both fine skills worth cultivating.
#823$# You never know when you'll be a contestant on "Mithril Chef"!|
63403|#822$# Are you hungry?
#821$# Let's get some food in you. I know %s2 is your favorite.|
63404|#823$# It's because I have a good regimen.
#821$# A human must exercise, and eat heartily of %s2.
#822$# For humans, good food is fuel for all your deeds and actions.|
63405|Looks like I finally have to sort out my inventory...|
63406|Say, about those potions...|
63407|I'm in a good mood today. Let's make a big meal!|
63408|How can I become a super awesome cook?|
63409|What's it like in the realm of spirits?|
63410|A friend's birthday is coming up, but I don't know what to get them.|
63411|#821$# Well, whatever you clean out, be sure you keep some potions on you.
#822$# It'd be embarassing to die to an injury that a simple potion could've cured.|
63412|#822$# Potions restore your HP gradually, so don't wait until you're at critical health to use them.|
63413|#823$# Oh? What's with the sudden interest?
#822$# Might I suggest %s2?
#821$# Fine food can elevate a good day to a great day.|
63414|#823$# Oh, but we must prepare for it first.
#821$# It is very important for becoming a professional chef to collect fresh materials.|
63415|#822$# It is a vast realm, far wider than a world.
#821$# It would be interesting to see your reaction, if you were to go there.|
63416|#823$# It really depends on the relationship you have with your friend.
#821$# The best gifts often relate to the connection between giver and receiver.|
63417|How do I deal with enemies stronger than me?|
63418|You know those potions I've got, right?|
63419|What do you want most right now?|
63420|Did you have a nightmare last night?|
63421|Heard any interesting rumors about %s2?|
63422|What do you think about cooking?|
63423|#821$# If you face a strong enemy, draw out the fight a bit.
#823$# If your healing and potions can cover the damage you take from a foe, you can win even against a stronger opponent.|
63424|#821$# I know all about %s2 - do you? It would be shameful to be defeated knowing you could have just used that to recover.|
63425|#821$# To be on the winning side of battle, of course.
#822$# You won't let me down, will you %s1?|
63426|#824$# It was an unpleasant dream.
#821$# Emptiness was encroaching all around; an insatiable nothingness.
#822$# I woke up just before all hope had been lost...|
63427|#821$# I've heard that two old kingdoms once fought over the recipe for %s2.
#824$# How many lives were lost in such a vain pursuit?
#822$# What mere meal could be worth the price of a life?|
63428|#821$# Cooking is a wonderful kind of magic you humans possess.
#824$# And just like magic, if you're really awful, you can hurt someone with it!|
63429|So, about those potions...|
63430|Potions are so expensive! I feel like I have to take out a loan to keep myself stocked up.|
63431|%s2 tastes so good!|
63432|I feel like I've lost my appetite lately.|
63433|How can I become better at something I'm not that good at?|
63434|What do you think about humans?|
63435|#821$# If you don't have any %s2 with you, you can at least sit down and rest to recover before moving onward.|
63436|#821$# Allies can support you in battle. The more you rely on them, the more money it saves you on potions.
#822$# It seems all would benefit from that arrangement.|
63437|#823$# If you follow the recipe, chances are, you'll arrive at a tasty dish.
#822$# But beware of deviating if you don't know what you're doing.
#821$# On the other hand, humans seem to love experimentation...|
63438|#821$# Perhaps you ought to eat some %s2.
#822$# I've heard that its taste will appeal to most any palate.|
63439|#823$# Well, practice makes perfect, as the saying goes.
#822$# But you have to keep in mind, sloppy practice will not help you improve.
#821$# Only perfect practice makes perfect. Take it at your own pace to make sure you learn.|
63440|#821$# The history of human civilization is fascinating. It seems the conflicts never cease...
#822$# But long histories also contribute to the richness of a culture.|
63441|I've felt kinda lonely lately...|
63442|Hey, about those health potions...|
63443|I'm really craving the taste of %s2.|
63444|Have you developed any new interests lately?|
63445|What do you think of Port Skandia?|
63446|There's a nice, clear sky today!|
63447|The strong often walk alone. Others do not understand what it is to be them, or to bear the burdens that often accompany strength.|
63448|#823$# Remember to buy potions while you're in town. You don't want to be in a dungeon and suddenly run out.|
63449|#822$# Hmm... Does %s2 really taste that good?
#821$# I didn't expect you to have the mountain-man appetite to eat it.|
63450|#821$# I find your world's "theatre" quite fascinating.
#822$# Sometimes, I remember the incidents on which the old tales portrayed are based.|
63451|#824$# Skandia is a rather backwater town, isn't it?
#821$# It's surprising someone as competent as you was raised there!|
63452|#821$# If you look up, there's a cloud that looks sort of like...
#822$# Well...it's kind of indecent; forget I mentioned it.|
63453|Hey, about those health potions...|
63454|I'm not a fan of how potions taste.|
63455|Hey, how would you feel about going on a picnic sometime?|
63456|How do you think I've been doing lately?|
63457|All this fighting has really worked up my appetite!|
63458|Do Eidolons ever sleep?|
63459|#823$# Have you tried %s2? I saw some other warriors using it, and it really brought them back from the brink!|
63460|#821$# It's said that the more bitter the medicine, the more effective it is.
#822$# What were you expecting it to taste like? Cocktails?|
63461|#823$# It sounds like a grand idea, %s1. Be sure to choose a good place.|
63462|#822$# Your fighting form has been good, but...
#823$# It wouldn't kill you to work with others a bit more, you know.|
63463|#821$# Seriously? Last time you practically inhaled your %s2.
#822$# Gluttony might be a virtue in Pandemonium, but not here.|
63464|#822$# We do. It's different from your sleep, though.
#821$# We don't really need beds. But on the other hand, we don't have comfortable pajamas like you.|
63465|You know those health potions?|
63466|What's the best way to use potions?|
63467|What do you think of cooking?|
63468|You seem like you're in a good mood. Should I be worried?|
63469|Why don't I ever see you eat anything?|
63470|When you connect to Gaia, do you ever get anything really weird?|
63471|#821$# I suppose for one like you, a crutch like potions is a necessity. Let's wean you off them, shall we?|
63472|#821$# It's a little-known fact that potion imbibed through the nostrils is absorbed faster by the body.
#824$# Wait, don't actually try it!|
63473|#821$# Cooking is a mundane chore, best left to servants.
#824$# I'm not sure what you find so fascinating about it.|
63474|#823$# Oh, it's quite delightful! I just received an invitation to a grand ball in Pandemonium.
#822$# What do you say? Care to be my consort in hell?|
63475|#822$# Your human food is...less than appealing.
#1020$# It needs to be more exotic. More raw.|
63476|#822$# From time to time,  yes.
#824$# One week, I received a diamond spork. Gaia's will is as capricious as it is mysterious.|

65001|#821$#Hey, it looks like there's a town near here.
#822$#Is it Helonia? I think it is! Let's check it out!|
65002|#822$#It smells delicious over here! Look at all the tasty fruit growing on all these trees... You think Bella will mind if I eat one?|
65003|#824$#Whoa, hold up! This place is swarming with pirates.
#821$#No wonder the townsfolk stay away. You'd better keep on your toes around here!|
65004|#821$#Hey, see those boats out there? Think they're with the Catseye pirates?
#822$#Where? Way out there in the water! Those dinghies going back and forth!
#824$#Oh, I guess you can't see it without the majestic vision of an Eidolon! Nyah!|
65005|#821$#Hm? No, it's nothing... Just... You don't want to end up like that kid Brian, right?
#824$#Well, I don't want you to end up like that either. If that means we must go our separate ways, so be it.|
65006|#822$#Whoa! Is that the Queen Arachnid that they call the Shadow of Helonia?
#821$#She's huuuuuuge! I hope you brought plenty of health potions!
#824$#I mean... I'm not trying to say that I don't think you can win. Just that it's good to be prepared.|
65007|#821$#I love talking a stroll through flower fields.
#821$#Something about the scent... lifts away all... of your worries... zzzzz...|
65008|#822$#Gnomes, huh. They're not the smartest bunch, so they make up for it by being overly aggressive.
#821$#Keep on your toes. They won't let us just strut into their camp like we own the place.|
65009|#821$#Did you see that? Rosie was totally checking me out!|
65010|#822$#Can you feel that? There's a weird energy in the air.
#822$#I wonder what's locked up in that temple over there?|
65011|#821$#That Templar has given us some curiously specific tasks.
#821$#Do you think she's come across other Envoys?|
65012|#821$#I heard that Lunarin's border used to stretch all the way out here.
#824$#Now it's just a breeding ground for ugly bugs! Ugly buglies!|
65013|#822$#Navea! This is the biggest human city, right?
#822$#Let's explore! Whoa, lookit that floating thing! Oh, and there are the shops!|
65014|#821$#Hey, look up there! It's the Cube of Gaia!
#821$#Ha ha, no, it's just a replica. But it's still pretty cool, isn't it?|
65015|#824$#Hm. The Military Zone. Lots of serious business going on here.
#821$#Look at them all standing in rows as that guy barks out orders! It's so regimented, I don't think I'd last a day...|
65016|#821$#Um, so, fair warning... You might want to give those Waterlight Mushrooms to Montero as soon as possible.
#824$#Beebis is staring at them and drooling. He looks pretty hungry.|
65017|#824$#This is it? This is the disguise?
#821$#I hope that Vhell is really, really dumb, 'cause this isn't gonna work if he's got half a brain.|
65018|#821$#You look ridiculous.|
65019|#821$#Huh. You can barely tell there's a human underneath all those twigs.
#821$#Just remember to take it off once we're done with this. You'll scare the children if you go back to town like that.
#824$#Wait... Do Dwarves even have children? Or do they just... always look like that?|
65020|#823$#Ha ha! Ha! Oh geez... sorry... ha hahah... ha...
#821$#No, I'm not laughing AT you, I'm... just... Okay, I'm lying, I am laughing at you.|
65021|#824$#Oh, wow! That Woodbeast Disguise is really, um, interesting.
#821$#No, no! It doesn't look bad... It's just, I don't know, I think maybe it just isn't your color.|
65022|#824$#Do you really think this is going to work?|
65023|#824$#That's a really good look for you.
#821$#...
#823$#Dangit! I can't keep a straight face!|
65024|#824$#Hm? Where did you go? All I see now is a weird monster.
#821$#Oh well, I suppose I'll just have to destroy it like all the other ones.|
65025|#824$#Aaaah! Ants ants ants ants ants ants ants ants...
#821$#Beebis! That dopey ostrich kicked over an ant nest! Oh, gross, they're everywhere!|
65026|#821$#Once we do a quick patrol, we can join the ROBOT FIGHTING COMPETITION!
#822$#I really think it should be capitalized, don't you? It gives it some, I dunno, some more oomph.|
65027|#821$#Those poor Butterfly Fairies... They're only aggressive because their water source has been contaminated.|
65028|#824$#It's weird. Caroline hates her Eidolon, yet it still sticks around.
#821$#You don't hate me like that, do you? We're, um... We're, like, a team, yeah?|
65029|#821$#All right! You're getting stronger!
#822$#I need to beef up as well.|
65030|#821$#Do you know about Masteries? They can really add some oomph to your lineup of skills.
#821$#You should do some research - they'll be a great aid in battle!|
65031|#821$#Yeah! Level up!
#821$#How's your gear doing? It might be time to see if you can equip some new stuff!|
65032|#821$#Level level level! And it even comes with a point for the Envoy's Path!
#822$#Whatcha gonna spend it on? Might I suggest Greediness? That'll help you find more XP Crystals to give me!|
65033|#822$#Dude! You just keep leveling up and up and up...
#821$#Now that you've hit 20, maybe you should start up a guild.|
65034|#823$#That level got you another point for the Envoy's Path!
#824$#I'm not trying to be "greedy," but you should put that point into Greediness!|
65035|#824$#You just keep raking in the levels... I can barely keep up!|
65036|#821$#Have I told you that I'm plugged into the All-Eidolon Radio?
#822$#Well, not really. I just can hear their voices sometimes... It sounds like they're impressed by how strong you've gotten!|
65037|#823$#Hey there leveler, you ever think about using your newfound beefiness to help others?
#821$#It might be time to head over to Mirabelle's Bulletin Board to see if anyone needs a hand!|
65038|#821$#Hey rockstar, you're now part of the 27 Club!
#821$#What? You mean the 27 Club isn't just for people who are level 27? Oh...|
65039|#823$#Another day, another level!
#821$#Another opportunity to show just awesome we are!|
65040|#823$#Level 30! Now we can get into Cactakara Forest!
#822$#We should chat with some of the Dwarves there... They know everything there is to know about machines.|
65041|#821$#Bigger, tougher, stronger, level-upper!
#822$#Let's go take on some elite baddies!|
65042|#821$#Keep shootin' for the stars! That's the way to succeed.
#821$#Huh? I learned that by watching you!|
65043|#821$#Yes! Another hard-earned level!
#824$#Bow-chikka-bow-wow!|
65044|#823$#Congrats! 38 is my favorite number for reasons I can't quite explain...
#824$#I wonder... When is Beebis going to start leveling up?|
65045|#821$#All-Eidolon Radio is buzzing again!
#821$#Some other Eidolons have been talking you up. I wouldn't be surprised if they try and get ahold of you soon.|
65046|#821$#YES! Level 40 is where all kinds of awesome stuff happens!
#822$#Survival Mode, Secondary Weapons, General Awesomeness!|
65047|#821$#How are you liking your secondary weapon?
#823$#You've picked it up really quickly... You must be a natural!|
65048|#822$#High Five! Why? Because you just leveled up!
#824$#And your new level is divisible by three, which means you get an Envoy's Path point!
#823$#Didja know? You can tell if a number is divisible by three by seeing if the sum of its digits is also divisible by three. Try it!|
65049|#823$#Groovy! You just learned a new skill for your backup weapon. Let's go try it out!|
65050|#821$#It always makes me happy to see you improve.
#822$#Oh, geez, now you're even tougher than me! I gotta go hit the gym!|
65051|#823$#LEVEL UUUPPPPPP! Wahoo!
#822$#What? So I got a little excited...|
65052|#821$#Ah yes, you have another Mastery available! Why can't you equip all of them at once?
#824$#Maybe I'm just greedy, but I'd want to stack them all on and just go berserk.|
65053|#823$#You've been levelized to 48! Now you can get even better gear from the shops!
#821$#Or are you too cool for store-bought gear these days?|
65054|#824$#All that hard work has paid off! You've been leveling up like mad!
#821$#But, ya know... It's also not a bad idea to take a break once in a while.|
65055|#821$#Fifty? FIFTY! Now things are really starting to open up!
#824$#We should pay a visit to the Grand Bishop... I'm sure he needs plenty of help.|
65056|#822$#Oh, don't mind me. I just get a little choked up when I see how far you've come!
#821$#It seems like just the other day you were barely in single digits, and now look at you!|
65057|#821$#Tons of levels and adventures. We've been through a lot together!
#823$#I don't think there's anyone else who could have accomplished what we have, do you?|
65058|#821$#That's another skill for your secondary weapon!
#822$#I think you've got a good combination going.|
65059|#821$#Have you chatted with the townspeople about the kidnapping?
#822$#Just call it a hunch, but I think that girl Bonita isn't telling us everything...|
65060|#824$#Huh. I wonder why there are so many Slimelings around here.
#821$#It seems like a strange place for them. Did they wander over from Demarech Pool?|
65061|#821$#Can you feel it? This whole place is buzzing with Gaia's energy!
#821$#But these designs aren't anything you'd find in Navea; it seems like there are groups other than the Church that believe in Gaia.|
65062|#822$#Is this the source of the weird energy in the air?
#821$#It seems like it's causing the nearby creatures to behave strangely.|
65063|#821$#Harvey used to be the Templars' top blacksmith, like Analisa is now.
#822$#I wonder why he retired...|
65064|#823$#A weapon forged from Miracle Crystal? Neat!|
65065|#821$#Looks like the sitch in the Hunter's Village is getting complicated.
#824$#No one can agree on what to do! What do you say we go give them a hand?|
65066|#824$#G-g-g-ghosts? What? No, I'm not scared! Not at all!
#822$#It's just... kinda weird, that's all. Maybe a bit creepy. We should be careful.|
65067|#822$#Hello? Is anyone else getting a sketchy vibe from this Maya girl?
#824$#I know... She's the only one who can disable the barrier, so we have to go along with her. I just don't trust her.|
65068|#824$#So, the barrier keeping us out of Deep's Cavern is gone now? Really?
#821$#Let's check it out. I wonder if Maya actually kept her end of the bargain.|
65069|#821$#This must be the spot where Lucas was found...
#821$#Let's take a look around and see if we can find any evidence.|
65070|#822$#I wonder why Mia wants us to bring back the Totem. Won't it be useless after we bust it up?
#821$#What, aren't you at all curious?|
65071|#821$#So Will was a spy all along? What would cause him to do such a thing?
#822$#What could the Corpsers have possibly offered him?|
65072|#821$#Will was really a Corpser spy? That's awful!
#824$#Well, looks like he will be getting what he deserves. Anya won't cut him any slack.|
65073|#821$#This is where the research team has set up shop, right?
#821$#The Church has a Scholar somewhere around here that we're supposed to meet up with...|
65074|#822$#This spring seems lively, like there's more to it than just water.
#821$#I wonder if this is due to the influence of the Cube of Gaia.|
65075|#822$#Ugh! How rude! Is it really too much for them to listen for just a few minutes?
#821$#Do we really want to form an alliance with those arrogant cats?|
65076|#824$#Who do the Makar think they are? Oooh, I'm riled up!
#821$#Let's go find some monsters to beat up on; I need to work off this anger!|
65077|#821$#Oh... This Makar is gravely wounded. I don't know how much we can do for him, but we at least have to try!|
65078|#821$#Woo! Beebis can really stretch his legs in these open plains!
#824$#Just don't let him become lunch for the beasts around here.|
65079|#822$#Lookin in this Makar's eyes; the pain he feels isn't normal. This is no everyday poison. 
#821$#I suspect something more foul, like a curse. Perhaps the Gnomes and their cruel tricks are to blame.|
65080|#823$#Isn't it funny? Not too long ago, you and Para were rivals in the arena.
#821$#Now the two of you are banding together to solve the mysteries in the Wrathborne Temple!|
65081|#821$#Whoa! Hey! Slow down! STOP!
#824$#You didn't even notice that gigantic spider dangling right above your head, did you? Geez, you can be so thick sometimes...|
65082|#821$#Zachary complains a lot about taking care of all the children.
#822$#But did you notice that he was smiling? I don't think he actually minds it all that much.|
65083|#824$#Would you look at this dreary place? It's hard to believe the Oblitus Wood was once known for it's lush greenery.
#822$#Even Beebis won't touch the plants here! And we're talking about an ostrich that once ate your shoe...|
65084|#824$#Everything here seems dead, and I'm not just talking about all the zombies!
#821$#Something is definitely wrong in this forest. Are the Dwarves really to blame for all this?|
65085|#821$#Remember what Camilla said; the Sand Owl Bandits poison their weapons.
#822$#We should keep on our toes out there.|
65086|#824$#Seriously? We get to scout the camp on our own while the mercenaries hang around doing nothing?
#822$#How is it we always get roped into doing all the work?|
65087|#822$#Caroline! Who would have thought that she was the one behind all of this?|
65088|#821$#Wh-what's that? Is that an earthquake?
#824$#No, it's something else. Something below the sands is stirring, like it's just waking up after a long sleep.|
65089|#821$#Were these monsters really once human? That's awful!
#821$#I wonder... Are we doing them a favor by destroying them?|
65090|#821$#Once every now and then we come across an Envoy who is brave enough to take on Survival Mode!
#822$#One slipup in that mode and you're done for, kaput, finito!|
65091|#822$#  There's just no reasoning with the Avian Patrol. They attack us without warning. Perhaps they're under some sort of spell... You must proceed with caution!|

65144|Nero: Too many of those darned pirates... We'd better get outta hear!|
65145|Nero: This is the Silverash Shore... I've made a decision! I shall go out to see and become a brave king!|
65146|An angry woman from afar: "Nero! You brat! Get back home this instant!"|

65166|There are people on the path to the west. I think they're the ones that Harrod mentioned.|
65167|The Tribal Chief is up ahead. Defeat the guards ahead and talk to him!|
65168|The Village Chief had indeed hidden some information, just as Alex had said. Go back and discuss the plan with him.|
65169|You quickly stuff the bandit mouse into a bag and take it to the Sages.|
65170| |
65171|You sense a powerful magic radiating from the nearby altar and decide to investigate.|
65172|It's over for now. You return the ceremonial vessel to the Tocha before going back to Candetonn Village.|
65173|You apply some medication on the soldier's injury. The soldier nods at you weakly to show his appreciation.|
65174|East of the pit|
65175|West of the pit|
65176|North of the pit|
65177|You leave the future of Gelu Village in the hands of Freddy and Barton, and return to the Hunter Village.|
65178|Head west from the northern exit of Hunter Village and you will reach Gelu Village.|
65179|After the defeat of the Infernal Shaman, the Hell Rift disappears.|
65180|This matter has been settled. Go back and report to Maya.|
65181|You stop in your tracks, sensing danger. You're not sure why you have an ominous feeling.|
65182|A group of hostile centaurs tries to block your path. Looks like you'll have to deal with them.|
65183|Not bad. A good fight. That's some agility!|
65184|Hunter Village North exit|
65185|Hunter Village East exit|
65186|Hunter Village quarantine zone|
65187|Victoria is handling things at the Temporary Camp in the South. Inform her that he has come round.|
65188|Victoria hands you some medicine. Go help the wounded team members heal.|
65189|You skillfully repair the barricade, making it even firmer.|
65190|Go to the airship to learn the current situation from Eddie, then find out about the Hellfire.|
65191|You find a wounded centaur soldier lying on the side of the road. It seems an injury has rendered the soldier unable to move.|
65192|Slanos puts the pendant around your neck and blesses you. Go and look for Emmie the scout now.|
65193|Emmie the centaur scout is somewhere in the vicinity, but it's a dangerous area to be out alone.|
65194|Animals hate the repellent smell of mustard grass, Pluck some leaves to deal with the Hellcats.|
65195|The prophecy stated that the disaster would happen somewhere in the south. Go to the excavation site to investigate.|
65196|There's an unfamiliar shape at the excavation site. It appears to be... a female centaur.|
65197|You might encounter demons whilst pursuing the Lavalord. Should any demon dare to attack you, don't hesitate to teach them a lesson!|
65198|There's a centaur soldier standing nearby. Looks like he is helping us. Go ask if he has any news.|
65199|The forest is not just dark and scary, it's also full of evil energy!|
65200|Go to the east gate of the Hunter Village to provide support!|
65201|The person hiding up ahead might be the elder that the little Goblin mentioned. You should go and check it out.|
65202|Barton seems to be in great pain. Go try the amulet on him!|
65203|Master, there are some ominous traces on the ground. They were probably left there by powerful demons. The Holy Sword Guardian power should not be that weak. I'm not sure what happened.|
65204|Use the Transparent Demon Core to get through the barrier.|
65205|Thanks to the power of the core, you manage to pass through the barrier. Now use the key to unlock the mechanism.|
65206|The most important thing to do right now is to get to the holy sword. Go and look for Arliss!|
65207|A centaur with a look of dignity and influence looks at you with his sharp eyes.|
65208|Nathaniel throws the letter that you have sent on the ground without even looking at it.|
65209|The elder is trying to attack you!|
65210|The Nebular Cliff Demon that was transformed by minerals is in a blind rage!|
65211|The village that used to be here has been razed to the ground. Traces of demonic devastation are the only thing that's left.|
65212|Up ahead -- isn't that the teenage boy that appeared in the memory of the Great Land? Try to talk to him.|
65213|Oland Village is located to the northeast of the Hunter Village. Go there to meet Mia and the others.|
65214|The tree valley that the Holy Sword Guardian mentioned is located to the west. Go there and see what the situation is.|
65215|Go further west and you will find the Barren Well. Go there and have a look.|
65216|As you move closer to have a look, you feel a power emanating from the minerals.|
65217|You look over the minerals, and suddenly feel a vaguely ominous sensation wash over you.|
65218|Master, do you still remember the minerals at the Demarech Mines? These minerals are full of power... We mustn't let them fall into the wrong hands!|
65219|The smell of the mustard plant is unbearable for the Hellcats.|
65220|A group of Hellcats slowly approach you and ready themselves for an attack. Just as the Hellcats are ready to spring, you ignite the mustard plant.|
65221|Thank you for healing me. You are a good man.|
65222|Ahh... I already feel much better. Thanks!|
65223|Now I don't feel like I'm in pain... Thanks for your help! I don't know what I would have done without you!|
65224|The minerals in the pendant react to the Power of Gaia. shining a little.|
65225|Entering the forest makes you feel uneasy...|
65226|Go to the north, and you might spot the demons controlling the Hammersaurus that is causing the monsters to attack.|
65227|You have spotted a group of demons casting spells. Go and stop them from controlling the Hammersaurus!|
65228|I'm fine. Let's go find Freddy.|
65229|As you approach the demon who is casting a spell on the tablet, a strong wave of evil energy washes over you.|
65230|You can feel magic core power entering your body. You might be able to pass through the barrier once the magic takes effect.|
65231|Looks like this powerful centaur is the elder. Give him the letter.|
65232|You defeat the elder, then bring him to Slanos.|
65233|The caravan members have disguised themselves as demons to attack you!|
65234|You've caught Bloodshot Eye Talusha. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Kelvin!|
65235|You've caught Ferocious Giant Ant Ribbitt. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Kelvin!|
65236|You've caught Charging Horn Damian. Go pick up the crate and give it to Guard Kelvin!|
65237|You've caught Blueblood Paroyagi. Go pick up the urn and give it to Guard Kelvin!|
65238|You've caught Ironcrusher Stalteri. Go pick up the crate and give it to Guard Malachai!|
65239|You've caught Crystal Horn Roalbarn. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Malachai!|
65240|You've caught Cyclops Ghost Roche. Go pick up the urn and give it to Guard Malachai!|
65241|You've caught Primal Curse Luigi. Go pick up the urn and give it to Guard Malachai!|
65242|The earth suddenly shakes, sending cracks rippling through the ground. You look up to see Bloodshot Eye Talusha rushing towards you!|
65243|You have awoken Crystal Horn Roalbarn. He's furiously rushing towards you!|
65244|Outside the camp, a fierce battle rages between a unit of soldiers and a pack of centaurs. Looks like neither side is giving in.|
65245|You are still worried about the centaurs, so you go there and have a look.|
65246|Aren't they the same centaurs who were just fighting with us over there? Don't tell me that he's trying to attack us! Let's stay away from him, Master. Just ignore him.|
65247|You just defeated the Nebular Cliff Demon and took back the glittering stone pendant, but you now realize that the pendant's been broken in the fight.|
65248|You are worried about Victoria, so you go back to the Temporary Camp to have a look at her.|
65249|You release the Power of Gaia that protects you from the impact of the crash, but you pass out due to the force.|
65250|You and Maya examine the tablet and then meet with Isai and Mia to discuss its purification.|
65251|Master, there's someone lying on the ground at the foot of the mountain to the southwest. Let's go there and take a look!|
65252|As you put the wrong ingredient into the pot, Stephen starts shouting: "Oh no! "That's the wrong ingredient! What are you doing?"|
65253|You put the correct ingredient into the pot. Stephen praises you, saying: "Nicely done. That's exactly right!"|
65254|Oh, no! What just happened? What is this strange magic? Well, gotta go! I've got a bus to catch. See ya round!|
65255|Ahahaha! That's a bingo! What should I do?|
65256|Allow me to bestow my blessings upon you. By the gods and by the frogs, by the sun and by the moon, Shine, shine down upon this warrior with luck's golden brilliance! Forever, til the end of time!|
65257|Too delicious! What will I do if I can never eat this again?!|
65258|This must be some amazing food, if the princess is so crazy about it.|
65259|This dumpling is glowing with some kind of mysterious light! Could it be the famous meat dumpling of legend?|
65260|"Hey! Human!"|
65261|A dwarf standing on the bridge is calling you. Go over and see what's going on.|
65262|The man to the side starts roaring at you for some reason.|
65263|"Hey, you! What are you doing over there?"|
65264|Water source|
65265|As you pass through, the pendant seems to glow with energy.|
65266|The pendant emits rays of light and starts swaying violently. The air rushing past your face is clearly being drawn somewhere.|
65267|Beep, system booting...|
65268|After you've set up the disruptor, it starts humming with the whir of machinery.|
65269|The soldier weakly nods his head in thanks.|
65270|Once you've treated him, he begins to get his color back.|
65271|But he continues to groan and still seems to be in some pain.|
65272|You sense an aura of divine kindness as you turn the book's pages.|
65273|Where the Holy Light touches the barrier column, a strange anomaly appears.|
65274|It then shatters...|
65275|The bright crystal absorbs the evil essence, then shatters into a million fragments.|
65276|Looks like it failed, we must tell Simmond at once.|
65277|Lordot: " Good, now click the triangle button!"|
65278|Lordot: "Alright! Now, click the square button to remove stand-by status."|
65279|Lordot: "Alright! Now, wait just a moment..."|
65280|Lordot: "And now click the round button!"|
65281|Lordot: "Here come the analysis results!"|
65282|Magur: "Head southwest, following the pool where the Primitive Parrot lives, and you'll see Akali."|
65283|Magur is fighting the Hanba tribe. Hurry and find him!|
65284|After leaving the tribe's territory, go right and head northwest to Battleland.|
65285|Follow the bridge further in and you'll see the team up ahead.|
65286|Barrier column marked location|
65287|Great! Glory be, we're saved!|
65288|There are demons up ahead! Be careful!|
65289|Don't be afraid! Keep moving forward!|
65290|Watch out!|
65291|Yes sir!|
65292|You're finally here! Hurry over!|
65293|Gawain: "After leaving the village, head directly north and you'll see a farm."|
65294|Conayn: "Return to the forest, and at the entrance you'll find a fork in the path. Keep left and it'll take you back to the village."|
65295|Simmond has gone ahead to the swamp. Hurry through the graveyard and meet up with him.|
65296|Simmond should be at the entrance to the swamp. Hurry back and give me the badge!|
65297|Crystal Forest|
65298|Sarpa Swamp|
65299|Tanglevine Village|
65300|Tanglevine Farm|
65301|Paradise Passage|
65302|Use the pendant around the forest.|
65303|There's no response from the pendant. This area looks clear, let's look somewhere else.|
65304|Find the barrier column based on Simmond's marker location and destroy it.|
65305|"I'll kill you!"|
65306|There's no time to lose. I need to deal with the blaze. Stand back!|
65307|Brother Isai!|
65308|With the guards defeated, the Church's forces beat back the enemy.|
65309|Kasheezy has run away. Chase after him and reunite him with Pooka.|
65310|Kasheezy has eaten all of Pooka's food and run away!|
65311|Kasheezy has appeared, attracted by the food.|
65312|Kasheezy is safely back with Pooka.|
65313|Paco: Who's summoning me with food?|
65314|Paco: If you want to know where Kasheezy is, use this corn.|
65315|Paco: Tanuki can't resist the taste of corn.|
65316|There is a sudden violent swaying. The demons must be attacking again!|
65317|There is another fierce vibration and the demons launch their frenzied attack.|
65318|You reach the depths of the Wrathborne Temple. The floor is littered with demon corpses. This looks like it must have been the site of many a fierce battle.|
65319|Andre shows you the way to Hell Rift.|
65320|You're about to step forward when suddenly you sense a wicked aura.|
65321|Belenus and Andre stride over to greet you.|
65322|As soon as you've left the dimension, the Magic Barrier blocking the dam disappears.|
65323|Now's your chance! Enter the dam and foil the Sarpa plan.|
65324|Discovering the Truth|
65325|You hear a child calling you from beneath a street light, and you go over to investigate.|
65326|Rose tells you that she and Jack often meet under the apple tree by the waterfall.|
65327|This must be the island. Look around and see if you can see any strange creatures.|
65328|A soldier calls over to you: "So you're here. Let me take you to the Battlefront."|
65329|The soldier shows you the way to the Battlefront, where you wait to see Victoria.|
65330|You've caught Crazed Tail Skirr. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Hurdur!|
65331|You've caught Striped Reaper Marco. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Hurdur!|

65337|You've caught Armor of Sin Iniquitus. Go pick up the crate and give it to Guard Haggum!|
65338|Oh no! The effects of the drug have worn off and your body is now returning to its original weight. You are going to fall down!|
65339|The fall leaves you seeing stars. Your rapid descent seems to have shocked an old woman. You hurry over to her and apologize.|
65340|Using the Special Floating Potion|
65341|As soon as you drink the potion, you feel yourself becoming lighter and lighter. Soon, you start to float up into the air, and the ground begins to spread out beneath you like a giant tapestry.|
65342|Pass Complete|
65343|Understanding the Target|
65344|Water Purification|
65345|Relaxing Fragrance|
65346|You swim to the base of the waterfall and cleanse yourself in its powerful spray.|
65347|Your whole body feels refreshed and relaxed.|
65348|You ignite the altar wood that Lorelei gave you and the aroma relaxes your whole being.|
65349|You feel completely at ease.|
65350|You take out a Wish List. On it is written: "Like points of starlight in the night, fortune's spell will bring you light."|
65351|Lorelei: This Wish List means that good luck is coming your way.|
65352|You take out a Wish List. On it is written: "No great hero, no elite, tastes success without defeat."|
65353|Lorelei: This is excellent, it means that hitting rock-bottom will only strengthen your will to succeed.|
65354|You take out a Wish List. On it is written: "No regrets, no stepping back, Stride straight forward and attack."|
65355|Lorelei: This is very auspicious. It means that no amount of hardship can stop you!|
65356|Set up the Fireworks at Clark Farm.|
65357|Set up the Fireworks at Lunarin.|
65358|Clark Farm's setup point is on the roof of the windmill up ahead. You should be able to get there without any problems.|
65359|Looks like Lunarin Village is right here at the house behind Peddler Percy.|
65360|The waterfall up ahead should work for the Water Purification rite that Lorelei mentioned.|
65361|After you've put the clues together, go and find the seven legendary Soul Stones.|
65362|You found the three remaining Soul Stones. Hurry and give them to Barbosa!|
65363|Rudi's wounds are worsening. He's lying on the ground, unable to move.|
65364|Rudi's gotten better.|
65365|Get the green maple leaf and hurry back to help Rudi heal.|
65366|Find the tree mentioned by Santa Claus and use the Fairy Knife.|
65367|According to Ametie's instructions, you should go to the Crescent Forest Depths to look for Imps.|
65368|You've collected 10 beautiful flowers! Send them to Ametie.|
65369|Frankenstein is following you disguised as a human. Take him to find his lover.|
65370|You've received Pandora's love letter. Don't open it! Just deliver it.|
65371|You opened the letter! You should apologize to Pandora.|
65372|As the shell melts, you can clearly see the internal structure.|
65373|You have started a fire and send the Smoke Signal.|
65374|The Giant Ant must be the target. Take it out!|
65375|You, Victoria and Caresha go further into the forest...|
65376|You wonder if you can find the Butterfly Fairy Leader. Or something else...|
65377|As you are contemplating on your way back to Ring of the Old Seal, you can hear a constant wail...|
65378|You trip over something strange by mistake...|
65379|Putting the gloves on, you can feel that your hands are full of heat energy.|
65380|The Energy Diffuser reacts to the Power of Gaia. Try again.|
65381|Marden: Looks like the diffuser is absorbing the Power of Gaia! Keep going!|
65382|Marden: Oh, it's full. That should do it!|
65383|What are you doing?!|
65384|Target area|
65385|Penny: Passing through the cave by the bay, we'll soon arrive at the Forsaken Wasteland.|
65386|Coleman: The cave at the cliff up ahead will lead you to the battleground. The soldiers are all there.|
65387|Anya: Go up and pass through the habitat of the Hammertails and you will see the village.|
65388|Odum: Go northwest, Anya was going in this direction.|
65389|You follow Penny' instructions and reach the deepest reaches of the battleground.|
65390|The Evil Energy Swirl disperses as if it were blasted. You feel somehow fishy...|
65391|A giant stone guard suddenly appears and comes at you! Take it out!|
65392|You can barely break up the angry debate between the two.|
65393|The demons that suddenly appeared were unexpected. You have to eliminate them.|
65394|Er... I mean... What's going on?|
65395|Huh?!|
65396|You...|
65397|After you have defeated the demons, you can sense a strong wave of dark energy closeby.|
65398|The stone guard drops a glowing Crystal Bottle as it falls.|
65399|Grrrr! Demons that don't even fight us head-to-head are no big deal!|
65400|Odum: I shall stop you!|
65401|What?!|
65402|As the evil energy explodes, a demon appears. It looks dangerous.|
65403|No need to take care of the Skeleton Soldiers, kill the demon in the lead!|
65404|Damn! I'm gonna kill you all!|
65405|Get the Energy Amplifier from Marden and install it in front of the wind cave.|
65406|The first device was successfully installed!|
65407|The Energy Amplifier attracts monsters. Protect the device.|
65408|The device's direction sensor does not work. Adjust it youself.|
65409|The second one is done as well.|
65410|Two more to go. Things go swimmingly.|
65411|You hear Marden's voice from in the distance.|
65412|Avoid that wind cave, it will weaken the effect of the device.|
65413|Finally you've taken out all the demons. Go back to see if Penny is alright.|
65414|Watch out! Monsters coming at you again.|
65415|You've activated all three of the amplifiers. Now go back and turn on the Energy Diffuser.|
65416|Remember to activate the device after installation.|
65417|It should be the other wind cave then.|
65418|Charge.|
65419|You've caught <Fiery Branch> Ignis. Go pick up the crate and give it to Guard Audery!|
65420|You've caught <Alluring Dancer> Blooma. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Audery!|
65421|You've caught <Don't Get Devoured> Floda. Go pick up the urn and give it to Guard Audery!|
65422|You've caught <Angry Jelly Chick> Buchon. Go pick up the egg and give it to Guard Audery!|

65427|Northern Patrol point of Forsaken Wasteland|
65428|Northeastern Patrol point of Forsaken Wasteland|
65429|That's gross! How dare you take those pictures of those girls?|
65430|Northwestern Patrol point of Forsaken Wasteland|
65431|Go east after leaving Magic Division and you arrive at the lake where it usually goes.|
65432|Forsaken Wasteland|
65433|Expedition Camp|
65434|Hill Road|
65435|The Energy Amplifier has to be installed close enough to the wind cave.|
65436|You've adjusted the direction. Try to activate it.|
65437|It's done. Go to the next place.|
65438|Activate the device!|
65439|Lightning Baroness appears suddenly and attacks the device.|
65440|Although Alex failed to stop you, nothing is happening to the device.|
65441|Lightning Baroness retreats, knowing that she is about to be defeated.|
65442|Here stands the trap that has tripped you up...|
65443|Your traces still remain...|
65444|Desecrated Ground|
65445|Deep Maw|
65446|Tempest Village|
65447|A magic wall appears suddenly and blocks your way.|
65448|You can feel a strong and evil energy nearby. The caster should be around here.|
65449|You've found the hidden crystal. It comes at you as if it were alive.|
65450|As you break the crystal, the barrier disappears.|
65451|Grand Bishop is ambushed! We gotta hurry!|
65452|Oh! The reinforcements have arrived!|
65453|And Brother Isai will arrive soon too!|
65454|Kill these demons as soon as possible. Everybody charge!|
65455|Andre... how could it be...|
65456|Here we come!|
65457|Brother Isai!|
65458|Keres: Looks like the major forces of the Church are all here.|
65459|That voice...!|
65460|Grand Bishop, please stay back! |
65461|Demons...|
65462|Oh! It¡¦s great to see you!|
65463|I didn't wasn't expecting the ambush. It was surprising.|
65464|Hold on!|
65465|Obviously their target is the temporary seal!|
65466|Victoria is not here. We should protect it.|
65467|But... I'm afraid we are not strong enough to...|
65468|I mean, I don't think we can do anything...|
65469|What is this nonsense?|
65470|The saviour has come already!|
65471|... Alright, take the path behind me and you can go farther.|
65472|Wait... are you kidding?|
65473|There are traps everywhere!|
65474|The fighting forces are all here. That means the village is vulnerable now.|
65475|Gosh! The villagers are in danger!|
65476|Go and chase after them!|
65477|Alex, Anya and Odum go back to the village. The others keep on moving.|
65478|Now the major forces have to be split in half...|
65479|Don't listen to him. The right path is indeed the safe path.|
65480|Nonsense! There are demons lurking about!|
65481|Don't tell me you're a demon impersonator...|
65482|What did you say! You're bored with life already huh?|
65483|???: "Hahaha! You really have bad luck...|
65484|Envoy of Gaia...|
65485|Today will be your last day! Hahaha!|
65486|Your ignorance and regret shall accompany you to hell!|
65487|In the midst of the Purple Aura, a groups of Skeleton Soldiers appear and surround you.|
65488|Odum and Victoria lead their troops to fight the demons. The place suddenly turns into a bloody battleground.|
65489|Escorted by the guards, Imma manages to board the airship and leave.|
65490|Andre is in the tent up ahead. Ask him about the state of the war.|
65491|And you take the next airship and fly to Tempest Desert.|
65492|Huh? There's one left...|
65493|Well, he can't be any threat by himself. Hahaha!|
65494|After them!|
65495|Buzz off! Small fry!|
65496|It takes you some time to set yourself free from the sticky trap...|
65497|and return to the entrance to prepare to try again...|
65498|Magic Division|
65499|Starseer's Valley|
65500|Butterfly Thicket|
65501|Prehistoric Ruins|
65502|Ring of the Old Seal|
65503|Chronowood|
65504|This path looks safe...|
65505|Oh? You came?|
65506|It's funny to watch you play with your traps.|
65507|I almost killed myself, hahaha!|
65508|How can this be?|
65509|The green bubbles... These are sticky traps...|
65510|Why are they scattered all over the place...|
65511|What happened!?|
65512|???: Don't worry about it.|
65513|You just have to know that this will be your graveyard!|
65514|Small Butterfly Fairy! Run!|
65515|I'll take care of them! Two paths to choose from!|
65516|You go inside first to check the condition of the seal!|
65517|Beware of the traps that are scattered all over!|
65518|This path looks complex. Give it a go?|
65519|And now, I'll take care of you one by one.|
65520|Are you all prepared to die?!|
65521|Shut up, demon!|
65522|I'll make you pay!|
65523|Hmph! How? Show me, will you?|
65524|Dagon: Don't think you've made it! That's just my clone...|
65525|Dagon: You'd better think better about how to thwart the queen's plan.|
65526|Dagon: Otherwise, I won't hold back next time! Hahaha!|
65527|Four Portals..... You've got to find them yourself.|
65528|Remaining Will: Before I complete, you should defeat the monster for me first...|
65529|Small Butterfly Fairy, are you alright?|
65530|You, Victoria and the others lead the remaining soldiers that can still fight to Chronowood Cavern.|
65531|This time we must stop the demons...|
65532|That's Chronowood Cavern... Hurry up!|
65533|Bidding farewell to Victoria and Caresha, you return to Magic Division...|
65534|The Amulet Isai gave you before resonates with the Crystal Bottle and glows.|
65535|The strong light covers everything around you, you can see from the gap in the light that something in front of you is changing.|
65536|As if the time had flown backwards, the girl that appears seems to be Delfonia who has not yet become a demon....|
65537|Ah... you're... finally... back...|
65538|To... stop the demons...|
65539|We're going to set the traps we made.... to stop them....|
65540|and... there will be... a number of portals...|
65541|There is... only ony correct procedure... to the seal...|
65542|I'll... tell you... now|
65543|The correct.... procedure is...|
65544|...|
65545|The mage dies before he can finish speaking.|
65546|The sticky traps here are somehow different from the others.|
65547|Hey, wait!|
65548|Great! Finally someone has come!|
65549|I am here to guard the way to the seal's exit.|
65550|And it is at the other side of the fire wall...|
65551|I've enchanted the traps in that region,|
65552|and only I can shift the traps so as to make a path free to pass through.|
65553|But because of the explosion, my leg is injured.|
65554|I can't go to the other side, and can only hide here...|
65555|I'll cast a spell on you,|
65556|as you get closer to the traps, the spell will activate automatically...|
65557|I'll leave it up to you. Please protect the seal!|
65558|The spell is activated! The trap is removed.|
65559|It smells fishy here...|
65560|Remaining Will: Thank you for bringing me here. I'll finish my last mission...|
65561|Hohoho... Reckless fool...|
65562|You will all die anyway once the queen obtains the Force of Time...|
65563|At least let me fight to my heart's content!|
65564|A mage lying dead... huh? There is something glowing near the corpse... try to touch it.|
65565|Ahhh! You're imbued with some kind of weird power...|
65566|A voice echoes in you mind... seems to be telling you something...|
65567|Stepping into the Chronowood Cavern, you feel the energy throughout your body is constantly changing...|
65568|Eonus: "He who steps into this land is responsible for his own death."|
65569|You sense the presence of the enemy and the energy of the Stream of Time summons the Phantom!|
65570|You feel the darkness from the statue disappear along with the thorns.|
65571|Dagon, "You again! Challenging my limit over and over again? "|
65572|Dagon, "Stop wasting my mercy, you ungrateful ant!"|
65573|Dagon, "Damn, damn!"|
65574|Dagon runs to the deep when a soldier catches him from the back.|
65575|Angus is talking to Victoria. Go to confirm the status.|
65576|Angus rushes into the deep.|
65577|Angus, "I'm going to find Simmond! Follow me!"|
65578|Lightning Baroness, "Damn, damn, we're cornered!"|
65579|Lightning Baroness, "Let's retreat!"|
65580|Lightning Baroness, "The final chapter of lightning is going to be buried with lost souls."|
65581|Simmond, "Damn!"|
65582|Simmond's voice comes from the front! Go and have a look.|
65583|Both paths lead you to the seal. Which one should you take?|
65584|Remaining Will: I've fulfilled my mission...|
65585|Help him, hurry up!|
65586|You inspired the power of Gaia, Mia and Maya and stopped the final blow of the Lightning Baroness.|
65587|Demon Queen, "The power of Excalibur... It breaks the cage instantly. However..."|
65588|Demon Queen: "Leaving without a goodbye?"|
65589|Voices come from the rear of the thorn.|
65590|Dagon, " General, General..."|
65591|Winston: "Dagon... you betrayed our trust ..."|
65592|Dagon, "... Please give me another chance, I will..."|
65593|Winston: "No. You have been working very hard. Please return the 'Token of the Queen'..."|
65594|Dagon, "Please, please don't... If you it's all yours back..."|
65595|Dagon, "... Ah..."|
65596|Winston, "Rest well."|
65597|Thorns created by dark magic disappeared.|
65598|Kinsley rushed out with his troop.|
65599|Defeat Kinsley and catch up with Isai.|
65600|Hurry, catch up with Isai!|
65601|Eonus, "... Souls who have given up your lives, wake from your ancient slumber!"|
65602|More stone guards have appeared!|
65603|Something in the water is moving.|
65604|An unknown figure jumped out of the water!|
65605|There is a ceaseless flow of energy.|
65606|The Goddess vanished from the water.|
65607|Dagon, "Very brave!" I thought the redhead was scared? "|
65608|Dagon, "Dealing with you," a little trick is enough! Ha ha ha! "|
65609|The evil aura seems to have thinned.|
65610|You threw Brynne's Lucky Rice Dumplings into the lake.|
65611|That's the Spell Caster! Take it out!|
65612|The imprint with which the flow of time converges suddenly changes. You obtain a different status.|
65613|The Stonearmored Dragon cannot stand the stench and runs away.|
65614|The ancient slate resonanated with the stone up ahead...|
65615|"It's the story of a girl..." Speaks a lonely voice in your mind.|
65616|"The kind girl adopted me... a Demon Wolf that was thrown to the Terra because of the Space-Time Crack," speaks the lonely voice in your mind.|
65617|"This is my sin. I killed my only family ...." The voice echoes in your mind making a lonely sound.|
65618|???: "Demon Wolf..."|
65619|???: "Whose clothes.... are these? "|
65620|???: "I see. You come back here because here is where you met her"|
65621|???: "In this case, are you willing to sacrifice your life for a chance to be able to guard this place forever? "|
65622|???: "To protect this place where you met, forever. "|
65623|"I do. I shall guard and protect this place of us. " The voice echoes in you mind.|
65624|Andre and Isai will take care of the demons flooding from the Gates of Hell Defeat the queen.|
65625|You tossed the Lucky Rice Dumplings in the water. Go back and report to Brynne.|
65626|Using the mask, you can see that Ashe's next move will be "Rock."|
65627|You've beat Ashe three times! Now you can challenge him for the championship belt.|
65628|The mask is malfunctioning! You're on your own!|
65629|This cow seems to be very fond of you. Maybe you can take it with you.|
65630|The lost cow is right next to you. Go back and report to Tardus.|
65631|These fabrics have been discarded. Anyone could take them.|
65632|Shuang Shuang: "Hey! Stop, thief!"|
65633|"Blast! You'd better not forget this!" said the Cloth Thief.|
65634|The thief escaped across the bridge, but it looks like he dropped something.|
65635|Town Guard: "We've been looking for you for a long time."|
65636|The thief was arrested by the guard.|
65637|Olsen took away your feminine clothes.|

65641|A frosty chill goes down your spine, making you dizzy and giving you shivers.|
65642|You stand before the energy's focal point. Start the Eight-Wail Sword ritual.|
65643|You suddenly hear a series of cries!|
65644|???: "Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!"|
65645|"I though 'Eight-Wail' meant the enemies would wail eight times..." said Ten Swell.|
65646|"It just cried 'Wow' eight times instead. And now it's broken? No wonder it's a legendary sword, I bet no one who used it lived to tell the tale."|

65847|You exit the camp and start moving south. Rather quickly, you reach the Forest Lake Path.|
65848|After you're done fumigating all of the camps, go back and tell the Village Chief.|
65849|Uncover some of those monsters waiting to ambush you!|
65850|The hidden Magic Barrier Stone appears before you.|
65851|The Barrier Stone has already been broken. It no longer has enough power to carry on.|
65852|The incantation activates, repairing the Magic Barrier.|
65853|Investigation Point 1|
65854|Investigation Point 2|
65855|Investigation Point 3|
65856|According to Bhuka's instructions, you found a hidden path in Helonia Mountain Cavern.|
65857|The Stone Man that Bhuka mentioned is just up ahead.|
65858|In the camp, you find clues that indicate someone has slept there recently.|
65859|You find dwarven footprints in the mud. The prints are leading north from the camp.|
65860|The footprints stretch all the way to the Guardian Village.|
65861|We've discovered their hidden traps! Destroy all the cannons!|
65862|There are a lot of Magic Barriers protecting Div, please try to break them and attack him.|
65863|They used to be friends and comrades, but Loki's corrosive power turned them into mortal enemies.|
65864|You tell the Village Chief's Wife everything you saw on your journey.|
65865|You explain that you only made it back here with lots of help from lots of different people.|
65866|You also tell her about Isai and the evil Loki, as well as the Gaia Gate.|
65867|Perhaps the Gaia Gate fragments are the key to rescuing Isai.|

65886|If you want to save Isai, a battle with him is unavoidable.|
65887|Put aside your feelings, stop hesitating and let your weapons talk to Isai for you!|
65888|He is the first fallen Envoy of Gaia. His story taught me about the dark side of humanity.|
65889|Even you may eventually fall if you allow your dark side to take over.|
65890|You must face the darkness in your heart and recognize it for what it is. That's the only way you'll be able to overcome yourself and break free of your limits.|
65891|Loki, "You really have disappointed me...Avidas."|
65892|Loki, "The power I gave you isn't allowing you to win, so I'll just have to take that power back, I guess..."|
65893|Awaydas, "Master...please...please give me another chance. If he hadn't unleashed that spiritual power, I definitely would have beaten him...."|
65894|Loki, "There are no excuses for failure..."|
65895|Loki, "The next time we meet, you shall meet your maker, Envoy of Gaia..."|
65896|Loki raises his staff and uses its power to stop you in your tracks.|
65897|The Cube of Gaia will send you back to the mortal coil.|
65898|What? Are you planning on giving up?|
65899|Such a tempting scent... The Fragrant Flowers are just up ahead!|
65900|Are you really not hungry? If you don't eat now, there won't be another chance... |
65901|The travelers who are delivering lucky packs seem to be eating something...|
65902|What? Aren't those mooncakes... Are people really eating them? That means I can too, right? |
65903|You took the salty recipe, make sure you get the Magic Egg Holder from MiuMiu!|
65904|You took the sweet recipe, make sure you get the empty bottles from MiuMiu!|
65905|You went to the location and set off the fireworks!|
65906|The fireworks caught the attention of the Heavy Guardian!|
65907|If you want it, you'll have to defeat it first! Fight!|
65908|The Legendary Fireworks Cannon's power is growing, it will go off after 3 minutes!|
65909|The Legendary Fireworks Cannon's power is growing, it will go off after 2 minutes!|
65910|The Legendary Fireworks Cannon's power is growing, it will go off after 1 minute!|
65911|Round up all your friends from around the world to watch the beautiful fireworks together!|
65912|There's so many Pumpkin Monsters here! Use the Ghost Box to catch them.|
65913|Here's the East Tablet, see if the Key Fragment is here.|
65914|Here's the West Tablet, see if the Key Fragment is here.|
65915|Here's the South Tablet, see if the Key Fragment is here.|
65916|Is this the Pumpkin Monster Gate? There's a stone tablet. Go over and take a look!|
65917|It's strange, why are Pumpkin Monsters appearing?|
65918|Heehee... Teeheeheehee... Heeheeheeheehee!|

65928|This type of plant grows in abundance here. Pick one to get a closer look.|
65929|Sarpa once again begin to swarm toward the altar. They must not reach it!|
65930|Be careful! A fresh horde of demon beasts approaches! Do not let them near the altar.|
65931|The ritual worked. All of the monsters have dispersed.|
65932|Loki, "Where do you think you're going, Keres?"|
65933|Place the Vacuo Barrier Stone here.|
65934|Loki, "Do you think that beast is of any help at all?"|
65935|Place the Terra Barrier Stone here.|
65936|Loki, "Lowly creatures aren't the least bit tasty."|
65937|Place the Aecor Barrier Stone here.|
65938|Loki, "Don't worry, I'll reunite you both soon enough."|

65945|Loki, "No? Must be just another Envoy of Gaia like the Shadow Knight."|
65946|Loki, "Do you really believe the Power of Gaia is enough to defeat me?"|
65947|Loki, "Hmpf, looks like you're not as weak as the Shadow Knight after all."|
65948|Loki, "Perhaps you should join me to replace that traitor."|
65949|Loki, "Oh yes! Keres, look who's dropped by to wish you a final farewell."|
65950|You're forced to fall back due to the Stinky Whiff.|
65951|Loki, "It's time for your reunion. Play with him even though he's but an empty shell now."|
65952|Loki, "If you survive this, Envoys of Gaia, come look for me in Diabulus."|
65953|Loki, "Heheheh..."|
65954|Defeat all of Loki's monsters.|
65955|Defeat Manticore.|
65956|You're stuck here. Ask Keres what she knows.|
65957|Stinky Whiff suddenly spreads from the plant you just plucked.|

65965|What a lovely little pumpkin!
This candy is for you!|
65966|Hey... Are you here for candy?
I've got a piece right here. Now hold out your hand.|
65967|Oh wow! So scary!
Maybe you can try incorporating pumpkin somehow...?
To thank you, I want you to have this.|
65968|Halloween Party Venue|
65969|Get over here, quick! The yummy barbecue is ready!|
65970|It seems that someone has fallen in front. Hurry over and take a look.|
65971|Amid the noise of the crowd, you slowly open your eyes.|
65972|You, disguised as a centaur, are standing at the village altar.|
65973|The Centaur Princess is tied to the criminal rack.|
65974|The Centaur Princess shook her head weakly, and the centaurs began to make noise.|
65975|With the order of Hippocrates, the tribe started blazing.|
65976|You and the villagers are driven out of the village by Hippocrates.|
65977|We must save Alcippe.|
65978|The tribe is in a sea of fire...Don't touch the flames of flame.|
65979|It's Alcippe! There's no time. Get up and jump!|
65980|You saved the princess and helped her to a corner of the tribe.|
65981|Speak with Alcippe to confirm her situation.|
65982|Defeat the centaurs and protect Alcippe.|
65983|After passing through Keres' teleportation barrier, you arrive at the secure camp.|
65984|The Warlock in front of you lets out a pained wail that constantly releases magic power.|
65985|A horde of monsters appear from beyond the barrier!|
65986|A powerful force paralyzes you!|
65987|Radboud: "All troops must obey me! We must never allow the contamination to expand again!"|
65988|Centaur Warriors loudly respond to the commander's orders.|
65989|Radboud: "Here we go! All troops, heed my call and attack!"|
65990|Defeat the monsters.|
65991|Radboud: "The next wave is coming. Don't let up! Forward!"|
65992|A giant demon is attacking. Defeat the demon and defend your position to the death.|
65993|It looks like the monsters' attack has finally stopped. Report to Commander Radboud.|
65994|A magical aura descends, and you are slowly lost in a fog.|
65995|A strange smell spreads around you.|
65996|"...Please forgive me, Alcippe."|
65997|The last moment before you lost consciousness, you heard|
65998|Radboud cries out, but mutters an unwavering resolve.|
65999|You just woke up, trapped in a sea of fire, as if your dream had returned.|
66000|At this critical moment, Keres rescue you from the fire.|
66001|After Mr. Alcippe became the leader, the purge began|
66002|The faction under the rules of Hippocrates was executed without exception.|
66003|Alcippe, who made the prophecy true, became the new leader of the Centaurs.|

66025|Yeben is seriously wounded. Get him some Topical Ointment!|
66026|The low pressure covers the entire Crystal Forest, where you hear the roar of a Hornbeast in the distance...|
66027|When you're still feeling dizzy, you suddenly hear the voice of a woman nearby...|
66028|Parffy: You two need to keep your voices down. There are dangerous creatures about... don't alert them.|
66029|Eliana: Mom...This place is so scary...Can we get out of here?|
66030|Eliana: Mom, when are we gonna get out of here?|
66031|Marceline: Didn't I tell you not to make a sound?|
66032|Parffy: Please... no more talk or they'll hear you...|
66033|Parffy: Okay... It should be fine here...|
66034|Parffy: Let's wait here. Wait for Dad to find the patrol...|
66035|Cong, please help defeat the nearby Hornbeasts!|
66036|Eliana doesn't seem alert... I've been having trouble on the road...|
66037|Parffy: Eliana, there are beasts around here. We can't make a sound...|
66038|Parffy: Don't worry, try to stay calm, Daddy will take you out of here...|
66039|Let's get out of here!|
66040|Suddenly, a strange voice rings out...|
66041|Parffy: No...It's the voice of Merrisan...Everybody quiet!|

66061|Well...Really? But you always say that...|
66062|Besides this...Did you hear anything else?|
66063|You! Are you trying to change the subject again?|
66064|Hayden looks completely lost in the making of mine. How should I call him?|
66065|Hayden...? Miss Hayden...? Hayden! !|
66066|No! No!|
66067|Miss Hayden... Excuse me... My doll...|
66068|No? What...? Ah! Doll!|
66069|Okay...For now, I trust you...!|
66070|Why do you sound like you don't believe it?|
66071|You look very suspicious...|
66072|What?! I'm very sincere!|
66073|Please! That's a life!|
66074|Save him! Your kindness will pay off...|
66075|Please! Save him! Save him!|
66076|A life awaits your salvation!|
66077|Do you feel your conscience?|
66078|You'll go to hell after death! You don't have a soft heart!|
66079|You aren't really turning him into fertilizer... Are you?|
66080|What's in your head?|
66081|Boohoo...I know.|
66082|¡K¡K¡K¡K¡K¡K¡K|
66083|Excuse me, what hardwork did you just mention?|
66084|Eek eek eek!|
66085|Hmm... How are you, Younger Brother?|
66086|Who is the Younger Brother?|
66087|Hello, Captain Kant.|
66088|Ah, hello, Envoy of Gaia... Is there anything I can help you with?|
66089|Captain Kant, can we go out to the base?|
66090|What? Safes, is it you? How can you incite an Envoy of Gaia?|
66091|You still have a whole family to look after! How can you spend time crying?|
66092|Boohoo! You're right! But I can't help myself!|
66093|Don't cry. Your teacher is waiting for you to show off your skills!|
66094|Yes, yes... I'll fulfill the teacher's expectations...|
66095|Come on... Are you looking for me?|
66096|We should have met sooner...|
66097|And you're too late...|
66098|Come on...|
66099|We've made a deal...|

66118|As you enter the dimension, everything is dark...|
66119|When you get back to vision... But the scene startles you...|
66120|Your rage has triggered the Power of Gaia within you.|
66121|Then, you discover that the Power of Gaia has broken through the vines!|
66122|You have become a friend of the Forbidden Treant. The Power of Gaia inside you seems to be trapped by Seals...|
66123|Think of a way to stop the Forbidden Treant from following you...|
66124|It's very ventilating here... If I could use this place to spread the scent...|
66125|Perhaps it will attract the attention of Forbidden Treants.|
66126|A breeze stirs, releasing the fragrance of the fruit...|
66127|Maybe Lavender Tribe blood runs through your veins...|
66128|The Magic Barrier gives you a familiar feeling...|
66129|The Power of Gaia within you seems to resonate with it.|
66130|The altar seems to be calling for you...|
66131|Light all the Resonance Mushrooms... Perhaps the answer you've been searching for is just ahead.|
66132|Ruth suddenly looks at you...and smiles at you maliciously.|
66133|Ruth: "Ha! Don't smug... Envoy of Gaia..."|
66134|Ruth: "Did you think having an Eidolon is great?"|
66135|Ruth: "This is just the beginning of your nightmare!"|
66136|Ruth: "Remember my words, little messenger!"|
66137|As the potion disappears, Ruth's words echo in your mind.|
66138|I can't get rid of the anxiety...|
66139|You rushed to the fox's residence as quickly as you could.|
66140|Huh? Where's the bell?|

91050|#824$#I haven't been able to breathe fire since I ate those weird things!
#822$#Hmm... maybe I need a little something to increase my firepower?|
91051|#823$#Ra-haha! My dragon fire's back!|
91052|Little Grimm in Slumberland|
91053|#821$#A few days ago, I dreamed about a mysterious warrior.
#822$#I made some notes about what he was carrying. I wonder - has Master seen any of these things?|
91054|#823$#Ra-haha! Just like in my dreams, and Master made it come true!|
91055|Alessa's Chore Chart|
91056|#821$#Beyond the battlefield, I hold myself to a high standard when it comes to cooking.
#821$#If only Master could help me get some suitable tools!|
91057|#821$#Thank you! What was that? You need a hand? No problem! I am Alessa, after all.|
91058|Stress to Impress I|
91059|#824$#Grimm's room is awfully dirty... I can't just leave it like this!
#821$#Can you get me some cleaning tools? I have to tidy up this Eidolon Menu!|
91060|#823$#With these, we can at least make things a little better. Master must agree with me on this!|
91061|Stress to Impress II|
91062|#824$#Oh no! I swept up Serif's collectibles while I was cleaning.
#822$#I need your help getting them back - you're my only hope, Master!|
91063|#823$#That's great! Now to arrange the items before Serif returns... Perfect!|
91064|Alessa's Do-Good Diary I|
91065|#821$#In this world, there are lots of people in need. We can't just sit around and do nothing!
#822$#Let's see... today we will take action. I hope Master had a chance to prepare the gifts!|
91066|#823$#I'll never forget the gratitude I get in return for handing out those gifts!|
91067|Alessa's Do-Good Diary II|
91068|#821$#Have you heard of the Mirabelle Association, Master? It's an organization that helps people.
#822$#To show our appreciation for their work, let's help them fulfill a few requests.|
91069|#823$#Ha! Master must feel overjoyed after helping those in need, yes?|
91070|Alessa's Do-Good Diary III|
91071|#822$#Master, have you heard?
#821$#There are monsters invading! Let's go get 'em!|
91072|#823$#Oh, my! I can't imagine dealing with this all by myself. Thankfully Master is here to help!|
91073|Gigas Gears Up I|
91074|#821$#Hear that? The singing contest is about to start. There's no time to lose!
#822$#Quickly, find these items. I must practice my vocals!|
91075|#823$#That's right, these are the items. I have to take care of my vocal cords, so I can sing well!|
91076|Gigas Gears Up II|
91077|#821$#If I don't eat a full meal, I can't sing well!
#821$#It's simply impossible to produce my usual melodious vocals on an empty stomach.|
91078|#823$#Ha! You really do understand me best.|
91079|Gigas' Gig|
91080|#821$#Proper training, done! Now I have to look the part.
#824$#I can't go on stage like this... Please, help me get a few items.|
91081|#823$#This contest'll be a piece of cake! I can do anything with your support.|
91082|Gigas Goes the Distance I|
91083|#822$#Alas, I neglected my battle training to prepare for the singing competition...
#821$#That's not good at all. Get me a boost potion - we must train quickly!|
91084|#823$#Excellent! With a hefty stock of potions, we'll have the advantage on the battlefield.|
91085|Gigas Goes the Distance II|
91086|#821$#A strong defense is crucial to gaining the upper hand on the battlefield.
#822$#We've talked long enough - it's time to prepare!|
91087|#823$#Exactly! A strong defense can make even the most powerful attack ineffective.|
91088|Gigas Goes Gaia|
91089|#822$#My inspiration comes from the Cube of Gaia, as does my power!
#821$#If you want to be stronger, you'll need materials for the Power of Gaia.|
91090|#822$#Ha! These items are all we need to make the key?
#823$#They've become part of me, haha!|
91091|Wolfgang Aelius Mozart I|
91092|#822$#Music is the most powerful thing in the world, don't you agree?
#821$#Would you like to listen to my performance? Then perhaps you can help me acquire a few items.|
91093|#823$#Thanks! Now I can take good care of my instrument.|
91094|Wolfgang Aelius Mozart II|
91095|#822$#The most beautiful melodies come from great composers... and naturally I compose my own music.
#821$#But I could really use some inspiration right about now. Perhaps you can suggest a muse?|
91096|#823$#Ooh, perfect! I've never felt so inspired!|
91097|Welcome to the Dollhouse|
91098|#824$#It's been so rainy recently, and I've been feeling gloomy.
#821$#But Ms. Shirayuki gave me a doll that fills the days with sunshine!|
91099|#823$#Isn't this called a Sunshine Monk Doll in the north?|
91100|Amped-Up Aelius I|
91101|#821$#I was hoping you could help me... er, I mean, help my friend... get a few things to conquer his weakness.|
91102|#823$#Aha! Thank you! I certainly... I mean, I'm sure my friend will appreciate these!|
91103|Amped-Up Aelius II|
91104|#822$#Do you know what those of us with powers of fire fear the most?
#821$#These items would be a big help... I must be more courageous! I'm counting on you!|
91105|#823$#Thank you so much! I wonder if that sister of mine is collecting the same things...|
91106|Heart of the Sun|
91107|#821$#Keys of Gaia are the source of power for all Eidolons; the more we evolve, the greater our strengths become.
#822$#Perhaps with sufficient materials I can increase my strength...|
91108|#823$#So this is what it looks like before a key is formed? The Power of Gaia is indeed profound...|
91109|Abraxas' Heel I|
91110|#821$#A weakness? Me? Haha, that's rich!
#822$#What, you've heard I have a weakness? All right, then - let's see some evidence!|
91111|#822$#Huh? How dare you! I certainly don't believe in ghosts!|
91112|Abraxas' Heel II|
91113|#821$#You still don't believe I'm perfect? Ha!
#822$#In fact, I'm so perfect I'll accept any challenge you bring me! Also, while we're on the topic... who told you this?|
91114|#822$#Whoa! They look a bit... wet. Nonetheless, I'm happy to accept them!|
91115|Abraxas' Heel III|
91116|#822$#Still trying to figure out my weakness, are you? You've got a lot of spirit! Haha!
#821$#If you can't find anything this time, I'll be the undisputed winner!|
91117|#824$#Aah! It had to be Tsubaki who told you! Get away from me... you can't make me eat this stuff!|
91118|Pumping Iron I|
91119|#821$#You can't just learn exquisite fighting moves like mine - you have to be born with them!
#822$#Well, maybe with lots of practice... Here, you can start by getting these items!|
91120|#823$#Ha! Don't worry about not being as good as me - at least you'll look nice trying!|
91121|Pumping Iron II|
91122|#821$#Good! Now collect these items and bring them to me. I'll be testing you on what you've learned!
#822$#What? Why do I need these things? Don't ask, just get them! Chop, chop!|
91123|#823$#Ah! Nothing like a few sports drinks to replenish your electrolytes after a workout, eh? Haha!|
91124|Abraxas Ascending|
91125|#821$#What, I need this? This?
#822$#You summoned me here just for this? What am I, your lowly servant?|
91126|#823$#Ah! Thank you so much! To sense my own soul in this fragment... It's magical!|
91127|The Imperial Diaries I|
91128|#821$#I think you have a lot of potential. So, how about it - want to learn how to be a ruler?
#822$#First things first: bring me these items!|
91129|#823$#Nicely done! You've learned the first step of being a king: learning how to serve! Haha!|
91130|The Imperial Diaries II|
91131|#821$#The next step to becoming a ruler is taking on powerful enemies to prove your skills.
#822$#Go ahead, take out some baddies. And bring back some loot to prove it!|
91132|#823$#Aha, nicely done! I knew you wouldn't prove me wrong!|
91133|The Imperial Diaries III|
91134|#821$#All right, final lesson! To truly reign, you must give what matters most: your heart and soul!
#822$#Are you willing to give me these things unquestioningly? This will be your last test.|
91135|#823$#Wonderful! You're perfectly suited to be my servant! What? I said I'd teach you to be a ruler? Nonsense!|
91136|Errands for Eligos I|
91137|#821$#As you may already know, I'm a world-renowned collector.
#822$#However, there's something missing from my treasure room... I have a feeling you know what I mean.|
91138|#823$#Ah! You are indeed the most loyal of my subjects!|
91139|Errands for Eligos II|
91140|#821$#You've certainly shown some exceptional abilities. But just to be sure, I need you to get a few more things.
#822$#Okay, fine - it's more than a few. Now, get to it! That's an order!|
91141|#823$#Very good, very good indeed! I knew you wouldn't disappoint me!|
91142|Eligos' Endgame|
91143|#821$#Now, then... The reason I summoned you in the first place...
#822$#After all is said and done, there's no one in the world who reminds me more of myself than you do.|
91144|#823$#Ah, but now I see - it is this power that has brought me to you!|
91145|Sigrun Kicks It Up a Notch I|
91146|#821$#Your dietary habits are rather worrisome... But I have an idea!
#822$#I can prepare meals for you. All I need are these tools.|
91147|#823$#That's fantastic. I had, erm, no idea how to MAKE these dishes. Ahaha, hrm, yes...|
91148|Sigrun Kicks It Up a Notch II|
91149|#822$#I've compiled a few healthy recipes, and now you can help me gather the ingredients.
#821$#This is going to be great!|
91150|#823$#Voila! Here, try some of this. Hey, are you okay?|
91151|Sensei Sigrun I|
91152|#821$#You need a good weapon for battle, preferably one with a human attribute bonus.
#822$#Those wild creatures are nothin' - greedy humans are the worst enemies!|
91153|#823$#Haha! You're my trusted friend, and thus you'll never feel the steel of my blade.|
91154|Sensei Sigrun II|
91155|#821$#It goes without saying that only a real battle can truly hone your skills.
#822$#But these enemies are a piece of cake for you!|
91156|#823$#Haha! Looks like I've got nothing left to teach you! |
91157|Sensei Sigrun III|
91158|#821$#There's a vital piece of equipment that every hero is destined to have...
#822$#If I could get my hands on it, my powers would be even stronger!|
91159|#823$#Yes, that's it! This brings me back to the days when my comrades and I fought valiantly, side by side...|
91160|Sigrun's Solemn Swear|
91161|#821$#I'm completely loyal to my master, but I am bound by an oath.
#822$#Sometimes I wonder if my master will uphold this oath...|
91162|#823$#You upheld the oath! I knew I was right to trust you.|
91163|Bosom Buddies I|
91164|#821$#Tsubaki is my friend, but recently I haven't seen her much.
#821$#Here, this is Tsubaki's most favorite most precious thing ever!|
91165|#821$#Thanks so much!|
91166|Bosom Buddies II|
91167|#821$#The Dragon Tyrant came by to say hello, and we had a great time chatting.
#821$#This is a token of appreciation for my friend.|
91168|#821$#Thanks so much!|
91169|Nalani's Night Terrors|
91170|#821$#I take my dreams very seriously. Dreams might not be real, but they can be extremely insightful.
#821$#I'm worried about the items I saw in my dreams.|
91171|#821$#Dreams are fantasy, but they seem so real...|
91172|Nalani's Curb Appeal I|
91173|#821$#I've got a passion for renovating things.
#821$#Could you collect these tools for me?|
91174|#821$#After collecting the tools... I need...|
91175|Nalani's Curb Appeal II|
91176|#821$#As for finding the materials... I'm going to need your help.|
91177|#821$#Are you ready to behold a masterpiece?|
91178|Nalani's Deep Thoughts|
91179|#821$#I came from the Cube of Gaia... Then I met you.
#821$#What could have created this bond?|
91180|#821$#Kindred spirits fit together like pieces of a puzzle, don't you think? You truly are my soulmate.|
91181|Training Montage I|
91182|#821$#My training is tough!
#822$#Make sure you eat a full meal, or you won't be able to keep up.|
91183|#823$#Master sets a bad example. Eating a full meal doesn't mean eating too much!|
91184|Training Montage II|
91185|#822$#Okay, let's aim for the targets on the list.
#821$#They're the easiest, but still give it your best shot!|
91186|#823$#Impressive. How was it? You're sweating like a pig... But you should be proud of yourself!|
91187|Uzuriel's Killer Instinct I|
91188|#821$#Remember the training from last time? Let's put it to the test!
#822$#The target is wary this time around... we'll need to lure him out with something.|
91189|#823$#You never know... you might be a better killer than I am... Heh, just forget I said that.|
91190|Uzuriel's Killer Instinct II|
91191|#821$#The trap is set, but we must proceed with caution.
#824$#I can't shake this feeling that something bad is about to happen...|
91192|#824$#Was the target hit? It looks like I was worried for nothing.|
91193|Uzuriel's Killer Instinct III|
91194|#822$#The target has been eliminated, but our mission isn't over...
#821$#The looted items are nowhere to be found, and we have to get them back.|
91195|#824$#I can't imagine how things would be if the organization was in charge...|
91196|Uzuriel Uncovered|
91197|#821$#I've been away from the organization for a long time... I wonder what my comrades are up to?
#824$#If only there were pieces of the Key of Gaia...|
91198|#822$#This... wow, I'm speechless. Thank you so much. Next up, it's...|
91199|Bel-Chandra's Beauty Bar I|
91200|#822$#Want to know the secret to my beautiful figure? Why, exercise and dancing, of course!
#821$#However, to get REALLY great results, I use a special beauty cream. It requires very particular ingredients...|
91201|#823$#Wonderful! With these ingredients, even a Cyclops could have a body like mine! Haha!|
91202|Bel-Chandra's Beauty Bar II|
91203|#822$#Dancing can help keep you in shape, but if you really want to be perfect...
#821$#You need to watch what you eat! And I have just the recipes...|
91204|#823$#And the last step is to eat it ALL! What, why aren't you eating? Aren't you hungry?|
91205|Bel-Chandra's Beauty Bar III|
91206|#822$#To be a truly elegant dancer, you need to accessorize!
#821$#Here, get me all of these items! I'll need time to pick out the perfect one...|
91207|#823$#Haha! Gorgeous! I thought you wanted to be beautiful? Don't be bothered by these little things! |
91208|Bel-Chandra Breaks the Ice|
91209|#822$#Shirayuki and I want to organize a dinner dance, but I can't show up empty-handed.
#821$#Help me collect these items, so I can bring a special beverage to share.|
91210|#823$#Excellent! Look at those delicious purple bubbles... Of course, you can have some too!|
91211|Bel-Chandra Blisses Out|
91212|#822$#Meditation and mental focus is the only way to become stronger.
#821$#Let's see what you're made of!|
91213|#823$#Ha, that's pretty impressive! It looks like your training methods work, too.|
91214|Bel-Chandra's Bond|
91215|#822$#I knew it... you received a piece of my spirit from the Cube of Gaia.
#821$#We're not strangers anymore - let me see the secret item!|
91216|#823$#Haha! See how my lightning makes these fragments shimmer!|
91217|Soaking Up the Rays I|
91218|#822$#Master, it's so nice out: a perfect day for sunbathing.
#821$#You've never heard of sunbathing? Ha! In that case, I'd like to ask you to prepare a few items.|
91219|#823$#Ha! That's great. Now we just need to mix these into a paste and apply it to the skin...|
91220|Soaking Up the Rays II|
91221|#822$#A sunburn? Impossible! Didn't you use my special... Oh!
#821$#I nearly forgot that you're a human. Hmm, I'll need to adjust the formula a bit.|
91222|#823$#I think I've got it! Try this new formula - now you should be able to enjoy the sun!|
91223|Vayu's Forbidden Scales|
91224|#823$#I'm furious right now - don't even try to touch my...
#824$#Just forget it! I can't force you to apologize.|
91225|#821$#So... I admit, I may have overreacted.|
91226|Didactic Dragon I|
91227|#822$#After last time, it's safe to say I should teach you some basic dragon manners.
#821$#These are some of a dragon's favorite things. If you don't mind, please collect them.|
91228|#823$#My kind is also keenly interested in treasure...|
91229|Didactic Dragon II|
91230|#822$#Dragons have a very different diet than humans...
#821$#Here are a few simple recipes - they're yours to keep.|
91231|#823$#Delicious! That hits the spot!|
91232|Vayu's Ultimate Sacrifice|
91233|#822$#Master, I'm absolutely loyal to you. I'll always be by your side.
#821$#I shall ask the Cube of Gaia to give you half my soul, as a pledge of my loyalty.|
91234|#823$#I was destined to find a Master like you...|
91235|Tea Time with Nazrudin I|
91236|#821$#This is such a lovely day. I wonder...
#822$#Would Master like to help me collect materials for making tea?|
91237|#823$#These might not seem useful, but they're very precious indeed.|
91238|Tea Time with Nazrudin II|
91239|#821$#This tea would be perfect with some delicious snacks.
#822$#Master, would you mind collecting a few tasty things to go with our tea?|
91240|#823$#Master, you must be exhausted by all these preparations. Let's sit down and enjoy this lovely tea.|
91241|Gnarly Nazrudin|
91242|#821$#Is Master interested in surfing? I'd really like to try.
#822$#Hey, master, let's go surfing together! What do you say?|
91243|#823$#The water is very deep. If Master is afraid, just hold on to me.|
91244|Building a Better Butler I|
91245|#821$#Does Master want to know what it takes to be an excellent butler?
#822$#First and foremost, you must have a refined sense of taste. Shall we try this first?|
91246|#823$#Ooh! You've chosen the best of all the items. Truly, Master has excellent taste.|
91247|Building a Better Butler II|
91248|#821$#Next, you need the best possible equipment. As a butler, your foremost duty is protecting your master.
#822$#You can't defend your master without the proper equipment. And of course, appearance is important too!|
91249|#823$#Not bad at all. You're a pretty good butler, Master. But you've got some work to do to be at my level.|
91250|An Arctic Appeal|
91251|#821$#I've been traveling with Master for quite a while, and I'd like to make a small request...
#822$#I'd like to obtain a few items that can hold my power, such as fragments from the Key of Gaia.|
91252|#823$#Now that's what I call being a true friend. Thanks so much, Master!|
91253|Yarnaros Takes Flight I|
91254|#823$#Does my extraordinary flying technique scare you? Ha!
#824$#Want to see it again? It's really not that hard. Just hand over your entry tickets! |
91255|#823$#I've wanted this for a long time! You're welcome to watch the show anytime you want.|
91256|Yarnaros Takes Flight II|
91257|#822$#The last performance got pretty good reviews... It's just...
#824$#It could be so much better. Perhaps you can help me get a few decorations so I can add some flair.|
91258|#823$#Not bad! I had no idea we had such similar taste!|
91259|Dieting Dragons I|
91260|#821$#Quickly! Empty your pockets!
#822$#You can't? Then give me these items, they'll do the trick. Hurry!|
91261|#823$#Ha! With these, I can set a bunch of traps and catch more food!|
91262|Dieting Dragons II|
91263|#821$#Of course I realize I can't just eat meat...
#822$#But just eating vegetables won't do either. Bring on the meat!|
91264|#824$#What's the point of eating at all if I can't have a nutritious meal?|
91265|Dieting Dragons III|
91266|#821$#Where does this newfound interest in nutrition come from? Well...
#824$#It all started when Bel-Chandra said I was too fat to fly. Maybe a balanced diet can help me slim down.|
91267|#823$#I haven't gotten any slimmer, but I certainly feel stronger...|
91268|A Tempered Tantrum|
91269|#822$#This isn't fair! Give me back my spirit fragments.
#821$#With help from the Power of Gaia, I can fly to the sun!|
91270|#823$#Excellent! Watch me fly to the sun with my stunning golden wings!|
91271|Quelkulan's Cauldron I|
91272|#821$#You've arrived at the perfect time. Can you help me?
#822$#I'm researching a potion, and it just so happens that I need something...|
91273|#823$#Thanks so much! I'll let you know what my research uncovers.|
91274|Quelkulan's Cauldron II|
91275|#824$#This biological experiment is proving to be troublesome...
#821$#You're here just in time. Help me find something that can neutralize the toxins!|
91276|#823$#My vaccine didn't work, but thanks to you the day is saved!|
91277|Quelkulan's Cauldron III|
91278|#821$#There's a problem with the formula... Here, and here...
#822$#There, I've revised it! I need your help acquiring the materials.|
91279|#823$#I'm absolutely confident it'll work this time. Do you want to try it? Hey wait, where are you going?|

91281|#824$#When I'm emotional, I can't stop myself from spitting poison...
#821$#I feel awful, and I'd like to apologize to the innocents who died because of me...|
91282|#822$#Perhaps I can use these items as an offering to those who died.|
91283|Quelkulan Makes Amends II|
91284|#821$#Hm... Once I accidentally poisoned an entire lake...
#824$#Though it's been neutralized, the lake's ecosystem is still very fragile...|
91285|#822$#These fish hatchlings will go a long way toward restoring the lake.|
91286|Quelled Experiment|
91287|#822$#I can tell I'm not at my full potential.
#821$#There must be something I can do to maximize my strength...|
91288|#823$#Isn't this my soul fragment? Won't it poison you if you keep it?|
91289|Zaahir Plays with Fire I|
91290|#823$#Wow, I haven't breathed this much fire in ages.
#821$#Hey, kid! You better get your gear ready, or you'll be burnt to a crisp!|
91291|#823$#Excellent! This should be ready to go.|
91292|Zaahir Plays with Fire II|
91293|#821$#I can't breathe fire under these conditions! I must have some refreshments first.
#823$#Don't just stand there, kid - go get some of my favorite food!|
91294|#824$#Haha! Good food is bliss. Hmm, a fire test? Yes, yes, after my nap.|
91295|Ramen with the Devil I|
91296|#821$#Speaking of food, would you like to try my hometown delicacy?
#824$#You'll have to bring your own tools and ingredients, though. I can't afford all that!|
91297|#823$#Haha! I can see in your eyes how much you want to try it!|
91298|Ramen with the Devil II|
91299|#821$#This ramen can't be eaten without the special seasoning!
#822$#It is, after all, a delicacy from the inferno...|
91300|#823$#Let's eat! Haha, the expression on your face is priceless!|
91301|Zaahir Lets Loose|
91302|#821$#Kid, did you know that my attribute is the wild flame?
#824$#If only I could enhance it... I'd be stronger than ever!|
91303|#823$#Bwahaha! Behold the incredible power of my fire!|
91304|Zaahir's On Fire|
91305|#823$#Hey, kid! What were you just holding?
#821$#Is that... it couldn't be... the item my core is destined to possess... |
91306|#823$#Amazing, that's actually it! Thank you!|
91307|Cyril Balances the Scales I|
91308|#822$#Justice is often defined as helping those in need...
#821$#If justice is important to you, complete the task I have given you.|
91309|#823$#Very good. This is a great start.|
91310|Cyril Balances the Scales II|
91311|#821$#Next is the selection of weapons. Though anyone can wield a weapon, its effect is not always the same...
#822$#Each fighter has a unique style and advantage, and each weapon can be modified in a special way.|
91312|#823$#You must master the modification process. This will allow you to enhance your weapons and equipment.|
91313|Cyril Balances the Scales III|
91314|#822$#The outcome of a fair fight depends on the experience of the fighters.
#821$#You must prove that you truly understand the importance of battle experience.|
91315|#823$#That's correct. I imagine you have carefully developed your own advantage on the battefield.|
91316|Cyril's Swordplay I|
91317|#821$#Does Master know the best way to improve swordsmanship?
#822$#By hunting as much as possible! Let's stop standing around and chase down some prey! |
91318|#823$#You are indeed my Master. Such flawless attacks... Your skills are impressive.|
91319|Cyril's Swordplay II|
91320|#822$#Another training session? Ha! Then it's time to get some proper equipment.
#821$#Done! Now for the proper auxiliary equipment...|
91321|#823$#Perfect! An ideal option for a fighter like you.|
91322|Chivalrous Cyril|
91323|#824$#May I be so bold as to ask a favor?
#822$#I had hoped that Master would give me some soul fragments, with which I can increase my power...|
91324|#823$#The Cube of Gaia has tasked me with accompanying Master forever.|
91325|Kotonoha's Fan Club I|
91326|#821$#A fan club? For me? Heehee!
#822$#Maybe we should distribute gifts to thank everyone?|
91327|#823$#It's true... I like Master most of all!|
91328|Kotonoha's Fan Club II|
91329|#821$#Ha! Is Master concerned about my fan club? Don't worry - you're the only one with a place in my heart.
#822$#What about this... if you're willing to help me find something, Master would be handsomely rewarded.|
91330|#823$#Heehee! I'll disband the fan club, just to prove that you mean the most to me.|
91331|Kotonoha's Little Secret|
91332|#821$#Master, I have a teeny little request...
#822$#My collection is missing something, and I'd like to ask for your help.|
91333|#823$#Heehee! This collection is my little secret. Please, don't tell anyone!|
91334|Kotonoha's Silky Skin I|
91335|#821$#The weather's been so arid lately... could Master do me a small favor?
#822$#This is the formula for my skincare cream. Perhaps you could help me gather the ingredients?|
91336|#823$#Heehee! Master is welcome to touch my skin.|
91337|Kotonoha's Silky Skin II|
91338|#821$#Exercise is key if you want smooth, supple skin.
#822$#If I could get these treasures, I might consider exercising with you...|
91339|#823$#Heehee! You're so amazing, Master. I bet everyone loves you!|
91340|You Can't Handle the True Form|
91341|#821$#You'd like to see my true form? Well, of course...
#822$#But only if Master gives me what I want!|
91342|#823$#Heehee! Master is so nice. What's that, my true form? But Master, didn't you know that I'm always in my true form?|
91343|Eye of the Tiger I|
91344|#821$#If you can't win a battle, don't bother discussing tactics. As for the easiest way to win...
#822$#Never turn your back on the enemy! Now do you understand?|
91345|#821$#Exactly! Preparation is key.|
91346|Eye of the Tiger II|
91347|#821$#Proper tactics are also important for winning battles. Setting traps is often necessary.
#822$#If you can, get the materials and start trapping prey!|
91348|#823$#Not too shabby. Clearly you've taken my lessons to heart.|
91349|Go Get 'Em, Tiger|
91350|#821$#Impressing ladies? Ha! You've come to the right place.
#822$#If you prepare these items, you'll be breaking hearts left and right!|
91351|#823$#Useless, you say? You must be doing something wrong!|
91352|Tigerius Got Talent I|
91353|#822$#Gigas is so talented. It'd be a pity if he didn't work for me.
#821$#Let's do something to convince him to join!|
91354|#823$#Ha! We can still be friends, even if Gigas isn't interested.|
91355|Tigerius Got Talent II|
91356|#822$#Cleopawtra's quite a beauty, eh? What, you think I have ulterior motives? No way!
#821$#It's just, she has such a nice figure... Anyway, let's get her some of her favorite things!|
91357|#823$#Wonderful! This should make my feelings - I mean, OUR feelings - abundantly clear!|
91358|The Age of Tigerius|
91359|#821$#My thirst for knowledge about the Key of Gaia knows no bounds. Its structure, its origin...
#822$#There are few subjects I find so fascinating...|
91360|#823$#Aha! So the fragments were assembled into the key that brought me here? Incredible!|
91361|Bahadur, Bahadur, Blacksmith I|
91362|#821$#If you want to survive on the battlefield, you'd better be sure your weapon is in tip-top shape!
#822$#Of course, the materials you use to maintain your weapon should be of the finest quality. Now, go get them!|
91363|#823$#Haha! Perfect! In order to become a true ruler, you must pay attention to the finest details...|
91364|Bahadur, Bahadur, Blacksmith II|
91365|#821$#The care and cleaning of guns is an entirely new branch of knowledge. Of course, it requires entirely different materials...
#822$#Going somewhere? Then I assume I can count on you to bring back these materials, yes? Haha!|
91366|#823$#I knew I could count on you! That wasn't so bad, was it? Haha!|
91367|Bahadur, Bahadur, Blacksmith III|
91368|#824$#What, you think we're finished? Nonsense! A weapon's maintenance isn't finished until it's been tested in battle!
#821$Since we'll be doing some fighting, you may as well help me collect these items!|
91369|#823$#Not only do we vanquish our foes, but the spoils of war make us stronger. It's like killing two birds with one stone! Haha!|
91370|Love Your Labyrinth I|
91371|#821$#I think the time has come to renovate my command post. But the workers need food! Quickly!
#822$#|
91372|#824$#That took far too long! Ah, but it appears to be high-quality stuff... perhaps there's hope for you after all!|
91373|Love Your Labyrinth II|
91374|#822$#The major renovations are complete... now this place needs some decoration.
#821$#Unfortunately, I'm too busy commanding my troops. I'll leave the decorating up to you!|
91375|#823$#Ah, perfect! I'll have the most beautiful labyrinth on the block! Haha!|
91376|The Key to My Gaia|
91377|#821$#I've always felt that the Key of Gaia contained part of my spirit.
#823$#The power of the Cube of Gaia is truly phenomenal!|
91378|#824$#Ah, incredible - that such a tiny thing could contain the power of one such as I! Haha!|
91379|Neglectful Ninja I|
91380|#822$#A true ninja can take a thousand forms! Now behold... Smoke Stance! Haha!
#821$#Oh! It appears Tsubaki has used all her smoke bombs. How can this be? Please, Master, help Tsubaki! |
91381|#823$#Yes, perfect! Just add this, a pinch of this, and... BOOM! Tsubaki is amazing, is she not?|
91382|Neglectful Ninja II|
91383|#822$#Tsubaki has other tricks up her sleeve besides smoke bombs. For example: throwing kunai!
#821$#Tsubaki makes them herself! Behold! HI-YA! Oh... I seem to have run out...|
91384|#823$#Ah, Master! Tsubaki will be with you forever!|
91385|Iron Chef Tsubaki I|
91386|#821$#You think Tsubaki should practice cooking? But why? She's already so good at it!
#822$#I can prove it! I just need a few ingredients, Master. Tsubaki will surely surprise you with her cooking skills!|
91387|#823$#Feeling hungry? Good! Just a slice of this... and a pinch of this... then mix it all together...|
91388|Iron Chef Tsubaki II|
91389|#821$#Ah, Master! It's terrible! Please, I need more ingredients...
#822$#It's for Zaahir - he ate some of the food I made, and somehow he got food poisoning!|
91390|#823$#Ah, wonderful! With these ingredients, I shall create Tsubaki's famous food-poisoning antidote!|
91391|Tsubaki's Truest Friend|
91392|#821$#The anniversary of when I first met Nalani is approaching. I have to prepare something!
#822$#Hmm... I have an idea... With Master's help, I'm sure I can pull it off!|
91393|#823$#Thank you, Master! Tsubaki loves you most of all!|
91394|Tsubaki in the Rough|
91395|#821$#Tsubaki knows that only those favored by the Eidolons can get Eidolon Keys.
#822$#Do... do you think Tsubaki has an Eidolon Key of her own?|
91396|#823$#Ah, it's beautiful! And so shiny! Thank you, Master, thank you!|
91397|Serena's Picture Book I|
91398|#822$#Serena is envious of Master's ability to decorate weapons so beautifully.
#821$#Perhaps Serena could try decorating her picture book as well...|
91399|#823$#Ah! Master is the best! Serena will get started right away...|
91400|Serena's Picture Book II|
91401|#821$#Serena's illustrations are coming along nicely. But more colors would certainly be nice...
#822$#What do you say, Master? Can you get Serena some more colors?|
91402|#823$#Thank, you, Master! With Kaiser Zeta's help, Serena will be able to turn these into such beautiful colors of paint!|
91403|Serena's Shine|
91404|#822$#Serena has heard tales of fabulous treasures buried underground...
#821$#Go, Master! Get some treasures for Serena! Yes!|
91405|#823$#Wow! Serena isn't sure what all of these things are... but she knows they look pretty!|
91406|Moon Mechanic I|
91407|#822$#Serena's moon looks a bit... shaky these days.
#824$#You don't think Serena got too fat, do you? Ah, no, it probably just needs some maintenance. Think of a solution, Master!|
91408|#823$#Ah, Master is a genius! Serena knew she could count on you!|
91409|Moon Mechanic II|
91410|#821$#Ever since Master's skillful repairs, Serena's moon is much more stable!
#822$#But it could still use a bit more work, could it not?|
91411|#823$#Master's forging skills can even be used on Serena's moon! Master, you're the best!|
91412|Desperately Seeking Serena|
91413|#821$#Master! I heard... I heard you gave Serena's key fragments to someone else!
#824$#How... how could you do such a thing?|
91414|#823$#Ah! So it was all a misunderstanding? Forgive me, Master! Serena likes you best of all!|
91415|Been There, Dune That I|
91416|#822$#Would you like to hear a story about the kingdom?
#823$#Stories aren't free, you know! All I ask is a small token in exchange for my tale...|
91417|#821$#Ha! I never imagined you'd be interested in my homeland.|
91418|Been There, Dune That II|
91419|#821$#My kingdom evolved in this endless desert, beneath the scorching sun.
#823$#Just thinking about it makes me parched... Why are you still standing there?|
91420|#822$#Hmm... The refreshments here aren't bad!|
91421|Been There, Dune That III|
91422|#822$#So... My kingdom is very similar to the Star Sand Desert. Beautiful and vast...
#821$#This reminds me, can you bring me something indigenous to the desert for my collection?|
91423|#823$#Ha! These items certainly do have a desert feel to them...|
91424|Cleopawtra's Top Servant|
91425|#821$#I'm positive you'll be able to get these things.
#823$I'll wait for you. Go now!|
91426|#821$#You are my most trustworthy companion.|
91427|Cleopawtra's Treasure|
91428|#822$#You're still young, so you couldn't possibly know that this land holds many precious items.
#821$#Can you help me find this treasure?|
91429|#823$#Aren't these things beautiful? So much antiquity...|
91430|By Order of Cleopawtra|
91431|#821$#Give me the key fragments! That's an order!|
91432|#823$#Ha! You really are infatuated with me. Well anyway, thanks!|
91433|Endora's Charms I|
91434|#821$#It's so nice out today. What a perfect day to meet Serif!
#823$#All I need is my good looks and perhaps a few flowers... please, Master!|
91435|#822$#Haha! Serif won't be able to resist me!|
91436|Endora's Charms II|
91437|#822$#Listen to this, Master... Last time I saw Serif, he had this awful pink hair!
#824$#This is infuriating. Bring me snacks! I'm going to eat my way through this frustration!|
91438|#822$#Mmmm... Master and snacks are my truest friends. But I refuse to give up!|
91439|Endora's Box I|
91440|#821$#Tomorrow is Grimm's birthday... which means it's time to play a few pranks!
#822$#Master shall be in charge of the materials. Hmm? But there aren't any other options to choose!|
91441|#823$#Haha! This gift will scare the pants off of Grimm!|
91442|Endora's Box II|
91443|#823$#Hmm... Perhaps if we set off some fireworks right behind Nazrudin...
#821$#Pardon me, Master, but I'll need your help again. We're in the same boat, after all!|
91444|#822$#Haha! That old geezer will be scared to death!|
91445|Endora's Box III|
91446|#823$#Last but not least, a prank for that awful pink-haired Serif! Let me think...
#821$#Ha! That'll do the trick. Get ready, Master! This must be perfectly executed.|
91447|#822$#Ha! This should scare the daylights out of that candy-haired fool!|
91448|True Romance|
91449|#822$#Haha, I know what to give Serif!
#821$#I'll give him the best gift of all: ME! Please help me get ready, Master.|
91450|#823$#Heehee, Serif won't be able to resist!|
91451|Vermilion's Vexation I|
91452|#824$#Master hasn't eaten much recently...
#821$#Vermilion made these, and Master might like to try them...|
91453|#822$#Stupid fool! Why did you make fish?!|
91454|Vermilion's Vexation II|
91455|#824$#Master still looks lethargic...
#821$#Vermilion is thinking of offering these... They will give Master newfound energy!|
91456|#822$#Stupid fool! Why a hat? Is it supposed to boost self-confidence?|
91457|Vermilion's Vexation III|
91458|#823$#Master looks more energetic! Perhaps because Master is meeting a certain special someone?
#821$#Is there anything that can be done to help?|
91459|#822$#Ridiculous humans! Stupid fool! Ah well, thanks anyway.|
91460|Vermilion See, Vermilion Do I|
91461|#824$#How do you cope with such a difficult battle?
#821$#Vermilion wants to be like you... Wearing such impressive armor!|
91462|#822$#Stupid fool! How are you supposed to move around in this outfit?|
91463|Vermilion See, Vermilion Do II|
91464|#821$#How is Master so good at fishing?
#823$#Vermilion wants to be a fishing expert too!|
91465|#822$#Stupid fool! Whose idea was it to learn how to fish?|
91466|Vermilion's Victory|
91467|#824$#Why is Vermilion here?
#822$#Ridiculous humans, showing this to such a stupid fool!|
91468|#823$#Isn't this... Vermilion's? This is fantastic! Vermilion has been blessed by the Power of Gaia!|
91469|Shirayuki's Pet Patrol I|
91470|#822$#Sigh... Willow seems so listless...
#821$#If only I had a few simple ingredients, I could make some pet food...|
91471|#823$#Thanks so much! Master must also be worried about Willow.|
91472|Shirayuki's Pet Patrol II|
91473|#821$#Willow is looking better now, all thanks to Master!
#822$#Now if only there were a few pet toys to cheer up Willow...|
91474|#823$#For me? Wonderful! Willow will be delighted.|
91475|Shirayuki's Snow Song|
91476|#822$#My singing always brings the snow and wind...
#821$#Master, I hope you can stay warm while I sing for you.|
91477|#823$#Haha! Such kind words, Master. I shall heed your advice...|
91478|Dining and Dancing I|
91479|#821$#Don't laugh, Master, but Bel-Chandra and I are organizing a dinner dance!
#822$#Can you assist with the preparations? I'm hoping to get these things ready first...|
91480|#823$#You're so reliable, Master!|
91481|Dining and Dancing II|
91482|#822$#The preparations are nearly complete! Now for the food...
#821$#Bel-Chandra and I can take care of most of it, but I need your help with the fish.|
91483|#823$#Haha! This event will be fantastic!|
91484|Sincerely, Shirayuki|
91485|#821$#I've been at Master's side for so long... I wonder, what does Master think of me?
#822$#I'll never forget how I was brought to you by this special item...|
91486|#823$#I really believe the Cube of Gaia wants to see me at your side. I feel so lucky!|
91487|Mecha-Maintenance I|
91488|#821$#Expert repair is the key to staying in tip-top form!
#822$#I need a few things to finish these repairs... I don't suppose you could help me out, could you?|
91489|#823$#If this metal body didn't always need fixing, it'd be pretty convenient! Haha!|
91490|Mecha-Maintenance II|
91491|#821$#Regular maintenance is just as important as repairs - it's never good to look old and worn-out!
#822$#You wouldn't want me breaking down, would you? No? Then help me out!|
91492|#823$#Haha! Whatever the task, I can always count on you!|
91493|Mecha-Maintenance III|
91494|#822$#Now that we're done with repairs and maintenance, all that's left is...
#821$#Energy replenishment! Get me these items, quickly!|
91495|#823$#Haha! Don't look at me like that - I still know how to enjoy a nice meal!|
91496|Works Well with Others|
91497|#822$#Dad said I should try to recall old memories by interacting more with humans.
#821$#I've always wanted to try fishing - do you think you could teach me?|
91498|#823$#Excellent! If things continue like this, I may someday get my memories back!|
91499|Heartstrings Activated|
91500|#821$#Beep! Key words detected. Switching to Automatic Mode.
#823$#I hope I can someday help Master's dreams come true. As such, I have the following request...|
91501|#821$#Ah, perfect! How did you know these were just the things I wanted?|
91502|Mecha-Memories|
91503|#824$#Since changing to this form, I sometimes fear I'll never get my memories back.
#822$#But don't these key fragments contain part of my soul? Perhaps if I could get that part back, it might help...|
91504|#823$#Well, my memories haven't returned... but I do feel stronger and more powerful! Haha!|
91505|Hoarding with Hel I|
91506|#821$#Lately, I've been keeping an eye out for some shiny, gleaming treasure.
#824$#But however hard I look, I just can't seem to find any...|
91507|#823$#Amazing! Thank you! I've been looking for so long...|
91508|Hoarding with Hel II|
91509|#821$#I have a few items that I cherish above all others.
#824$#But I haven't seen them for several days... do you think they could have been stolen?|
91510|#823$#Ah, thank you! I'm so happy!|
91511|Handmade by Hel I|
91512|#822$#My brother's birthday is coming up, and I'd like to make him something special...
#821$#Perhaps you could give me something to get me inspired?|
91513|#823$#Perfect! Now I know just what to make...|
91514|Handmade by Hel II|
91515|#824$#Hmm... I don't think there's quite enough material...
#821$#Can you help me find a bit more?|
91516|#823$#Thank you so much! I'll be sure to tell my brother we made this together...|

91518|#821$#The food's all ready! And with this beautiful dress, I'm nearly ready!
#822$#But I'm still missing just a few things... Can you help me out one more time?|
91519|#823$#Ah, perfect! My brother will be so happy! Haha!|
91520|Hel on Earth|
91521|#821$#What's this thing you used to summon me? Ooh, shiny!|
91522|#823$#Wow! It's so mysterious... Does this mean we're destined to be together?|
91523|Bealdor to the Bone I|
91524|#824$#What? "Bealdor doesn't look so invincible to me"? Who would dare write such a thing!
#821$#Quick, I need help getting a few things! I'm going to teach this loudmouth a lesson!|
91525|#822$#Ah, thank you! What? Did I just want these things for myself? Nonsense! I need them for... reasons!|
91526|Bealdor to the Bone II|
91527|#821$#Next, you'll have to help me prepare some food!
#822$#What? Hungry? Of course not... I... I just need it to prepare for battle!|
91528|#823$#What?! Where did you get this? It looks amazing! This will certainly taste - I mean, help with my training! Yes!|
91529|Lost and Found|
91530|#821$#Whew! Alucard and I had a pretty big fight...
#824$#Now he's looking for something, and he forgot where he put it. Can you help him find it?|
91531|#821$#What? Is this what he was looking for? Aha! Thank you!|
91532|Bealdor's Remorse|
91533|#824$#Hel, Hel... are you still mad at me? I wish I could give you something, but Terra is so big...
#821$#Hey, can you help me out? I made a list of things Hel might like - can you help me find them?|
91534|#821$#Ah, good! Now she's sure to forgive me! What? Of course I'll put your name on the card too!|
91535|Bealdor to the Bone III|
91536|#821$#What? Where'd the letter go? I don't know, I guess I lost it...
#824$#Anyway, who cares? I think you should help me beat whoever wrote it!|
91537|#821$#Huh? Why you... Oh, I'm just kidding. You always know how to cheer me up!|
91538|Bet on Bealdor|
91539|#822$#Traveling with you is pure bliss - well, maybe not PURE bliss, but it's pretty good!
#821$#When I first joined you, I remember feeling like a mysterious power was trailing me...|
91540|#821$#This fragment - it has the same energy I have! So it was the Power of Gaia that brought us together after all.|
91541|Alucard Takes Terra I|
91542|#822$#I've heard of a mysterious skill practiced in Terra... I believe it's referred to as alchemy.
#821$#Could you give me a demonstration?|
91543|#823$#Very mysterious, indeed! And you're mysterious too, if you have skills like that...|
91544|Alucard Takes Terra II|
91545|#821$#Your world is just chock-full of items!
#822$#I find the archaeological ones especially fascinating... Think you could get your hands on some for me?|
91546|#823$#These are the treasures of your realm! Don't worry, I'll keep them safe...|
91547|Alucard Takes Terra III|
91548|#821$#I'm not picky when it comes to eating... but I am very curious about cooking.
#822$#Do you think you could cook something for me?|
91549|#823$#Ah, incredible! You truly are a culinary master!|
91550|All About Azuria|
91551|#822$#My realm seems so different from yours...
#821$#Do you think you could get me some items from your world, for my personal collection? |
91552|#823$#Incredible! You live in a truly abundant realm.|
91553|Alucard, Armed|
91554|#821$#I've heard of legendary battle equipment that can be obtained in Terra...
#822$#I must admit, I find the stories very intriguing!|
91555|#823$#Haha! I wonder whether, someday, someone will name a piece of equipment after me...|
91556|All About Alucard|
91557|#822$#I must say, I've always felt drawn to you by some mysterious power.
#821$#What manner of thing could be causing this...?|
91558|#823$#Aha! Fragments from the Cube of Gaia itself... How fortunate I am to have met you!|
91559|Killer Kusanagi I|
91560|#824$#These demons that claim to be some sort of elite beings...
#821$#I hate the very sight of them! Why wait? Kill them! Kill them now!|
91561|#823$#Wonderful, thank you! Ah, it's so nice and quiet now...|
91562|Killer Kusanagi II|
91563|#821$#You know the key to doing well in battle? Food! The more we eat, the bigger our advantage!
#822$#Hey! What are you waiting for? Get us some food, quickly!|
91564|#823$#Mmm, not bad! Clearly, I was right to entrust you with this task. Haha!|
91565|Killer Kusanagi III|
91566|#824$#How could I forget? It must be because I'm a divine sword... sometimes I forget how important equipment is.
#821$#Come, let's put the equipment into the bag!|
91567|#823$#Haha! Now I'm truly invincible!|
91568|See Reverse for Care I|
91569|#821$#As the world's foremost sword, I must always pay close attention to maintenance.
#822$#In regards to these items, I'm certain you know Terra better than I do. I'll let you take care of this!|
91570|#823$#Perhaps this is what you call "skincare"? No? Well, thank you anyway!|
91571|See Reverse for Care II|
91572|#822$#Haha! Kotonoha explained my mistake from before.
#821$#I won't mess it up this time. These are the items I need - I'm counting on you!|
91573|#821$#So this is applied... where? Can you help?|
91574|A Request from the Best|
91575|#824$#I'm here because you are the chosen one, but there's something else...
#821$#Some mysterious power that draws me to you. What could it be?|
91576|#821$#The Key of Gaia! You truly are the chosen one.|
91577|The Game Is On I|
91578|#827$#Gretel's snacks have been stolen! Somebody here is a thief!
#821$#If my hunch is right, those items should have left traces we can use as evidence.|
91579|#821$#Master, you're a wonderful assistant. Let's see, the evidence shows...|
91580|The Game Is On II|
91581|#822$#We're getting closer to the truth! Who could the thief be?
#821$#The evidence must be carefully assessed...|
91582|#824$#The evidence all leads to one conclusion. The thief is... ME! Oh no, I should apologize to Gretel immediately!|
91583|Gretel's Goodies|
91584|#822$#Brother ate all of Gretel's snacks...
#825$#Every last one. Those were Gretel's favorites...|
91585|#822$#Master, you're the best! But I don't think I'm ready to forgive my brother...|
91586|Sisterly Love|
91587|#825$#Brother's birthday is coming soon! I want to get him something special... especially since I was such a brat last time we spoke...
#822$#Brother's been obsessed with fishing lately, so perhaps some fishing gear? You'll help me, right?|
91588|#822$#You're the best! Brother will love it.|
91589|Brotherly Love|
91590|#824$#Gretel's birthday is coming up, but I think she's still angry with me... What should I do?
#826$#These are Gretel's favorites, but I can't get them by myself...|
91591|#826$#Thanks! She has to forgive me now!|
91592|Gib, Gab, Gossip|
91593|#822$#Ooh, Gretel has some news! Perhaps it can be exchanged for something valuable...
#821$#Let me think... there's always the key that summons my brother and me...|
91594|#822$#The key is fragmented? How ironic. The news is that my brother and I are joining a band!|
91595|Astraea's Life Lessons I|
91596|#821$#I often see gatherings beside the lake... What happens there?
#822$#Fishing? Sounds like fun! Can I try it, too?|
91597|#823$#Haha! If the catch is good, I can cook it up!|
91598|Astraea's Life Lessons II|
91599|#821$#Digging like crazy... for treasure?
#822$#Archaeology... I've heard of it before... Can I try it?|
91600|#823$#Haha! How about you do all the digging? I'd rather not get my hands dirty!|
91601|Astraea's Life Lessons III|
91602|#822$#This weapon and I share a birthdate.
#821$#I've heard that humans are experts at forging things. Perhaps those skills can improve my weapon...|
91603|#823$#That's very helpful. Maybe now I can enhance my Lance and Shield.|
91604|The Finicky Gourmet|
91605|#822$#I'm a picky eater, and I don't really enjoy food all that much.
#821$#That said, would you like to try my cooking?|
91606|#823$#These tools and ingredients don't seem too bad. I'll see how it goes!|
91607|Astraea Suits Up|
91608|#821$#Battle skills? The most important thing is preparation!
#822$#So how about it? Can you get me the proper equipment?|
91609|#823$#Excellent! This equipment is top-notch. It seems you have an eye for quality gear!|
91610|Lead Me Astraea|
91611|#821$#Only those who are true to themselves can understanding the meaning of victory.
#822$#I will demonstrate, if there are fragments of the Key of Gaia.|
91612|#823$#Okay, everything's ready to go! Now, allow me to demonstrate.|
91613|The New Sound I|
91614|#821$#What's wrong? If Master wants to see Cesela's concert,
#822$#simply trade something for tickets!|
91615|#823$#Haha! Thanks, Master! Hmm, tickets? We haven't organized them yet.|
91616|The New Sound II|
91617|#822$#I've got to get Aelius in to see the band!
#821$#Can you help me get these items, Master?|
91618|#823$#Haha! This should be enough to set the traps... Oh! Pretend you didn't hear that, Master!|
91619|The New Sound III|
91620|#821$#Can you help me and my band prepare lunch?
#822$#Haha! This band is really on the road to success!|
91621|#823$#Thanks! You should come see our performance later!|
91622|Material Girl I|
91623|#821$#Master, today Cesela would like a new outfit!
#822$#Preferably with matching accessories. Here's the list...|
91624|#823$#Excellent! You're the best, Master!|
91625|Material Girl II|
91626|#821$#The accessories are great, but Cesela wants a few more items...
#822$#That's it! Let's defeat the monsters and loot this stuff from them!|
91627|#823$#Haha! They're all mine, mine, MINE!|
91628|One in a Million|
91629|#821$#But what does Master think of me?
#824$#Sometimes I fear that Cesela is becoming a carbon copy of Serena...|
91630|#823$#Does Master mean to say that I'm unique? Then give me the whole key, haha!|
91631|Diao Chan's Sudden Idea I|
91632|#822$#Say... since you're such a seasoned world traveler, what do you think is the best material for making a new outfit?
#821$#I'm in the mood for some new jewelry...|
91633|#823$#Eureka! Once refined, this material will make some amazing jewelry!|
91634|Diao Chan's Sudden Idea II|
91635|#2$#I've got the odd feeling that something's missing... Can't you feel it too?
#822$#Yes! Fish scales! I heard that some special scales make amazing jewelry... Do you know anything about them?|
91636|#823$#Wow...! You sure do know what you're doing! If I use these to make some new jewelry... You'd like that, right?|
91637|Diao Chan's Sudden Idea III|
91638|#821$#Next up... these two items! Haha, have you thought of any special combinations?
#822$#Maybe you and I have similar thoughts... I'm counting on you!|
91639|#823$#All dressed up on a sultry night like tonight... Wanna go out, master?|
91640|Diao Chan's Defensive Measures|
91641|#821$#Unlike Astraea, I don't have a shield to protect myself...
#822$#Could you help me find some suitable protective gear, please?|
91642|#823$#Thanks! You're the best! I hope you'll still protect me, though...|
91643|Diao Chan's Divination|
91644|#821$#Hmm... what's the relationship between Alucard and Bealdor? Does Uriel stand a chance of becoming...
#822$#Haha! I'm blessed with the powers of divination, didn't I ever tell you? Say, could you help me find some items?|
91645|#823$#Wow, that was fast! You really wanted to know more about it, huh?|
91646|Diao Chan's Riddle|
91647|#821$#Here's my riddle: There's a special something that not only enhances your abilities, but also makes you catch the eye of other women.
#822$#It could help break the ice between you and me, master. What am I referring to?|
91648|#823$#Ha, you're pretty smart! So, do you want me to give this gift back to you? It's a pretty useful item...|
91649|Big Brother|
91650|Big Sister|
91651|Tanith's Fresh Off the Boat|
91652|#822$#Hmm... Isn't this Terra? Doesn't look too bad...
#824$#You! Give me some food. I'm starvin'!|
91653|#823$#This is what you call a delicacy? It's barely edible! Haha... hahahahaha!!
#821$#This isn't quite up to par with that I'm used to! I guess it's better than nothing...|
91654|Tanith's Vanity I|
91655|#824$#This Diao Chan sure is popular... Everyone's always giving her things!
#823$#Hmm! So... Why are you still here? Go get something for me!|
91656|#822$#That's not bad... But it's smaller than I had been expecting.
#823$#And it took you too long!|
91657|Tanith's Vanity II|
91658|#821$#Sigrun's weapon sure is nice, isn't it? Hey! You!
#823$#Get me these items. I want to create a weapon more powerful than that sword and shield!|
91659|#823$#Hahaha! With these items, I will definitely be able to make an even more powerful weapon!
#821$#Hmm? What's with that expression? Reward? I never said anything about a reward! You impertinent little troll!|
91660|Tanith's Sulking|
91661|#822$#What? Is something the matter? Do I look like someone who gets bothered by trivial matters?
#821$#Although, not being able to find this one particular item does bother me a bit...|
91662|#823$#Huzzah! My beautiful item! Wow, you found a way!
#821$#Skincare is a must for me - I need to have tender, smooth skin.|
91663|Tanith's Curse|
91664|#821$#Darn that Aelius! How dare he try to stop me from attending his stupid band's concert...
#822$#All right then, he can have it his way. I'll show him not to ruffle my feathers! You! Get me these items!|
91665|#821$#Took your sweet time, didn't you! I'm missing prime cursing-time!
#824$#Hmm? You don't 'approve' of my 'actions'? What are you talking about?
#822$#I'll have you know that I am EXTREMELY good-natured!|
91666|Tanith's Great Expectations|
91667|#821$#You know what? I actually see some potential in you... And I also hope that you could use my power.
#823$#To acquire greater power... I do have high expectations for you!|
91668|#823$#Your loyalty to me will pay off in the future!
#821$#So if anyone dares try to bully you, just tell them my name and Tanith will take care of them.|
91669|Maja's Gourmet Experience|
91670|#822$#It's been a long time since I've last stepped foot in Terra.
#821$#I wonder if they food has gotten any better...
#822$#Go fetch me some specialities to try out, but remember - no seafood!|
91671|#821$#That's not bad... Do you know how to fish?
#822$#Looks like I don't have to worry about good food in the future.|
91672|Maja's Backup Materials I|
91673|#824$#I can't repair anything without the proper materials...
#821$#You're closer to Terra than I am.
#822$#You wouldn't mind helping me get these items, would you?|
91674|#822$#Mmm, not bad! Clearly, I was right to entrust you with this task. Haha!
#821$#Now I can continue working.|
91675|Maja's Backup Materials II|
91676|#824$#This is definitely not enough...
#821$#What am I doing right now? What's it to ya? Well...
#822$#Maybe I'll tell ya, but you gotta get me these items on the list first.|
91677|#822$#Very good, I have everything here. Now we can talk about whatever you wanted to talk about.
#821$#So what do you want? Ah, about the mummy sewing skills. Of course! Astraea is coming too.
#822$...Why didn't we get you before finishing the discussion? Wait, where are you going?|
91678|Maja's Witchcraft Experiment|
91679|#822$#Kusanagi has an interesting idea.
#821$#If we applied Healing Wind on the equipment, would it save us on having to repair the equipment in the future?
#823$#Definitely not?! How would you know?! You haven't even tried it! Help me get a piece of equipment! Go on, go get it!|
91680|#821$#All right. Now let's check out the result... WHAT?! It failed!
#824$#It can be done to Kusanagi, so why can't it be done to the equipment?
#823$#What? So Kusanagi isn't considered a piece of equipment?|
91681|Maja's Strategic Teachings|
91682|#821$# Hey kid... You may be good at many things, but cunning is not one of them.
#822$#Get me these items, and I will teach you how to deal with cunning enemies.|
91683|#822$#Have you brought everything I've asked for? Good. Then let's continue...
#821$#Hmm? Wait a minute. Are you saying that instead of using them for curses, we use them to make better equipment?
#822$#Well, I guess we could do that... But this better not be to get out of having to learn. Or is it?|
91684|Maja's Malady|
91685|#824$#There are some things that even I can't do, and this is one of them.
#822$#I must establish a stronger connection so I can protect you, kid.
#821$#You need to go and get these things. It's up to you.|
91686|#822$#You took great care in finding these items... You are indeed my dearest child.
#821$#As promised, I will continue protecting you until the end of time.|
91687|Uriel's Training Plan I|
91688|#825$#If you want me to fight by your side, there's something you must prepare first!
#827$#The first step is to check the quality of the equipment in Terra.
#826$#I have a feeling it isn't in great shape.|
91689|#821$#Wow, it's looking better than I had expected.
#826$#With a little more force, you could crush this thing with one hand!|
91690|Uriel's Training Plan II|
91691|#825$#We checked the equipment's power. Now it's time to get your body into shape.
#826$#Come on! You've got to prove your worth to me before I fight with you!|
91692|#823$#I always believed you could do it!
#827$#Wow, you're quite something alright. I've always had a good feeling about you.|
91693|Uriel's Manly Cooking|
91694|#821$#Oh yes, I remember you mentioning to me that you wanted to try my dishes.
#827$#It seems as if the time has come. I've already got the fire going. I need your help in getting the ingredients.|
91695|#821$#So, how is it? It's much better than you expected, isn't it?
#822$#Horrible?! But... how can that be? You've probably lost your taste buds and forgot all about it!|
91696|Uriel's Renovation Hobby|
91697|#826$#Oh yes! Are you interested in renovating?
#827$#Ever since Amaterasu taught me that, I've always wanted to try it. Do you think you could help me find these materials?|
91698|#821$#You're great! Now I can make the world's firmest sandbag!
#823$#The last one rotted away quite quickly. I'll make sure this one lasts longer!|
91699|Uriel's Gourmet Appreciation|
91700|#825$#Last time you said that my food was horrible! This time I'll give you something you'll never forget!
#827$#I believe that angels and humans have different tastes.|
91701|#822$#Oh my goodness... Did you really grow up eating this type of food?
#825$#No wonder you thought mine wasn't good. I've never tried anything better than this!
#823$#This is far too delicious!!!|
91702|Uriel's Resolve|
91703|#824$#So I've made a decision: If I'm going to protect you, I need something else...
#821$#I need something to become stronger and I can only count on you.|
91704|#827$#Thank you! With me by your side, I see that these flames aren't just intended for destruction...
#821$#This fire must not be extinguished. It exists to protect the person it deems worthiest.|
91705|Amaterasu's Riddle I|
91706|#823$#I have a question about eating, making money, and upgrading one's living space.
#821$#What requires special tools and a bit of patience?|
91707|#823$#You really are something!
#822$#Hmm? I am also interested in fishing. What a coincidence!|
91708|Amaterasu's Riddle II|
91709|#823$#I have another question, but this time around, it's about training, creating, and enhancing equipment abilities!
#821$#There's a mysterious power in it... A masterpiece of human intelligence...|
91710|#822$#You didn't even break a sweat! Was it really that simple of a question?
#821$#I wonder if there is any question that could test you.|
91711|Amaterasu's New Weapon|
91712|#821$#I am very interested in the humans' common weapons!
#823$#Which weapon do you think best suits me?|
91713|#821$#You are so wicked... I haven't seen anyone like this since Kusanagi.
#824$#You're always making fun of me! It can be really irritating! But I bear it anyway.|
91714|Amaterasu's Gourmet Feast|
91715|#821$#When I met Kusanagi, I found out that the food in Terra was so different than I had expected!
#822$#Will the different food culture affect the progression of abilities? Haha! Just kidding...|
91716|#821$#Do you want me to try? That was quite thoughtfully done.
#823$#...! Mmm, that was delicious! Everything else pales in comparison to this!|
91717|Amaterasu's Hobbies|
91718|#823$#For me, my favorite moments are when I assemble and disassemble things!
#822$#Does that interest you at all? Machinery, disassembly, assembly forging! I know I'm interested in all of that.|
91719|#821$#This tool is not too bad. You do have an eye for this kinda thing.
#823$#You're giving this to me? This is really...! I've always wanted to have this!!!|
91720|Amaterasu's Choice|
91721|#821$#If I want to protect you, I need to strengthen the connection...
#823$#Help me gather enough power to shield you.|
91722|#823$#I want you to use my power!
#822$#You, too, need to enhance your strength and become my partner on the battlefield!|
91723|Dragon Philanthropy I|
91724|#822$#Earlier I was by the side of a river when I saw a boy who was fishing. I wanted to tell him the fishing line wasn't tied tight enough...
#821$#But he ran away as soon as I opened my mouth. Perhaps I was too ugly! Haha!
#822$#Help me give this fish to him! To show my sincere apology.|
91725|#822$#Though I suppose giving him money would be a faster way. Give a man a fish, he eats for a day. Give a man money, he can buy a fish?
#821$#Of course, he could buy something else too! Maybe he doesn't even like fish. Who knows? Haha!|
91726|Dragon Philanthropy II|
91727|#821$#The child that I mentioned last time, he was helping his grandfather to fish,
#822$#but his shoes are so old and torn. With the riverside being so muddy, he could slip and fall!
#821$#Help me get him a pair of shoes that is suitable for fishing!|
91728|#821$#I think this pair of shoes should be of great help to him! Haha!
#823$#Anyway, thanks for helping me to get these!|
91729|Ghodroon the Geologist|
91730|#821$#I don't think I have properly observed the metals in Terra.
#822$#Help me get some special ones!
#821$#I want to look more closely into the difference between these and the melting flame.|
91731|#821$#All done with the gathering? Wow, faster than I expected! Must be due to those special skills of yours. Haha!
#822$#You're right! We could buy these,
#821$#but getting them from you would make it more meaningful.|
91732|Ghodroon's Surf 'n Turf|
91733|#821$#I heard that all the food in Terra is of the finest quality.
#822$#You've traveled all over the place, so you should know a lot about the food all over this world.
#821$#Can you help me pick a food from both land and sea? I'm sure that your selection will not disappoint me.|
91734|#821$#These dishes are so delicious, I'm hungry for more...
#822$#Have I ever told you I was a bit greedy when it came to eating? Now you know.|
91735|Ghodroon's Treasure Index|
91736|#822$#I've heard that there are many things people in Terra refer to as treasure.
#821$#I want to know more... So, could you help me out with that?|
91737|#822$#Oh? So these are some of the treasures found here in Terra! I will add them to my collection.
#821$#No, I don't really like collecting treasures.
#822$#But these are special, because they come from you! So they're a worthy treasure, wouldn't you say?|
91738|A Goad for Ghodroon|
91739|#822$#I have come to Terra because I want to find someone who can share treasure with me, but who will not lose their head at the same time.
#821$#And now, without any doubt, I believe I have found that someone.
#822$#Let's enhance our connection! I will share what I have with you.|
91740|#822$#Haha! I know that you will not disappoint me!
#821$#As promised, I will share what I have with you,
#822$#And I promise to stay with you, no matter what!|
91741|Alice's Wonderland I|
91742|#824$#No, no, not here! I've been watching it closely, but I keep losing it anyway!
#821$#Could you help me find it, Master? I was actually following a rabbit...|
91743|#823$#"Great! You're smart... We should be able to lure the rabbit out with this!
#821$#This time around I'm sure to find it...|
91744|Alice's Wonderland II|
91745|#821$#Ches has said that Alice's rabbit might only be in her dreams...
#823$#But Alice is not going to give up. I must catch that rabbit!
#822$#Heehee... We caught that wascally wabbit!|
91746|#821$#Thank you, Master! If I catch that rabbit, I promise I'll tell you what one tastes like!
#822$#Heehee... Huh?!|
91747|Alice's Sorrow|
91748|#503$#Sob... Alice... can't eat anymore...
#821$#Ah! I fell asleep just like that... Hmm...
#822$#Heehee! Looks like Alice was dreaming of food, she must be hungry right now...|
91749|#821$#Hoohoo! Thank you. Alice will eat a bit... Just a bit!
#823$#No! I'll eat everything!|
91750|Alice's Sorrow|
91751|#821$#Master, what's your secret? How do you stay so strong? Will you tell Alice?
#823$#What should I do... I want to get big and strong like you!|
91752|#821$#Oh wow I never thought about that... Diet and... and exercise, you say? Wowza.|
91753|Alice's Errand|
91754|#824$#Sob... Sister Diao Chan wants me to prepare something... But I'll never find everything I need to make it...
#822$#Heehee! Do you have time to help Alice?|
91755|#823$#Great! Thank you, Master! Next we have to give these items to Brother Bealdor...
#821$#Hmm? No... I'm not sure why either...|
91756|Alice's Confession|
91757|#821$#Master... Ches and I have something that to tell you... Don't be angry...
#822$#Heehee! So, um, actually, the real reason we are here in Terra is because we wanted to steal your power.
#821$#Do you still trust us?|
91758|#823$#Master... You're the best! Ches and I are gonna stay with you forever!
#822$#Heehee! After all, you're the strongest! You're even stronger than the Power of Gaia!|
91759|Ayako's Ice Playground|
91760|#823$#Ayako also wants to make snowmen and ice sculptures!
#824$#It never snows when Ayako is outside, so Ayako must always make her own ice to play with.
#822$#Master, can you help Ayako make ice so that she can play?|
91761|#823$#Master is awesome!! Master has given Ayako some ice. Ayako is free... to make ice sculptures!
#821$#Man, oh man. Why do we need this? I'll tell ya! Because this brings up lots of water!
#823$#Ayako can make all of the ice she wants now! Super smart, right?|
91762|Ayako's Special Sauce|
91763|#824$#Phew! Ayako is all out of special sauce! Ayako has no more energy to do anything else!
#823$#Ayako ate the most important ingredient. Ayako is sorry!
#821$#What will Ayako do now? Will Master help Ayako find some more? Oh, Master! You're the best!|
91764|#823$#Master can do no wrong in Ayako's beautiful eyes.
#821$#Did I say something? Does Master want to have a taste of this too? Ayako promises to share some with Master when it's done!
#825$#So... what now?|
91765|Ayako's Special Sauce II|
91766|#824$#Master, Ayako can't give you any more sauce.
#824$#Ayako also has to eat--oh no!! Ayako dropped the bag of ingredients!
#821$#Oh Master, will you help Ayako find some more?|
91767|#823$#Yay! Master is truly incredible! That's just what Ayako needed!
#821$#Ayako can finally make some more sauce.
#821$#Ayako will make sure not to eat it again.|
91768|Ayako's Gourmet Adventure|
91769|#823$#Master, have you heard about the famous Choice Barbecue Steak? Ayako is really hungry for some!
#824$#What?! Master has tried it before?! Sob! But Master... Ayako is hungry!|
91770|#826$#Huh? That smells delicious! It must be Choice Barbecue Steak!
#821$#Did Master really bring this for Ayako?
#823$#Oh goodie! Ayako must have it now! Yay! This is the best thing that Ayako has ever had!|
91771|Ayako's Revenge|
91772|#825$#That Hel is such a bad girl! Ayako must punish her!
#821$#The only problem is that everyone has vowed to protect him! What can Ayako do?
#823$#Oh, I know! Master, can Ayako have these?|
91773|#823$#Master is so great!
#821$#Hmph! Ask Alice to send these to that good for nothing sud bucket!
#824$#Let that meanie taste some of Ayako's special ice bombs!|
91774|Ayako's Dream|
91775|#824$#Hm... Master... I had a scary dream!
#822$#In the dream I grew very huge and very hungry, so hungry that I ate Master and the whole world!
#824$#Sob... I-I don't want that to happen. Master, please give me strength and connect with me.|
91776|#823$#Yes! Master is one-of-a kind! You are the only Master for Ayako!
#821$#If the connection between Ayako and Master is stronger, that dream is sure to never come back!
#822$#Ayako will stay with Master forever!|
91777|Eternia's Collection I|
91778|#821$# After mingling with other Eidolons, I've realized that they're all very interested in learning about Terra.
#822$# That's why I want to help them all increase their knowledge and learn! I'm interested in history and collecting knowledge.
#823$# You'll help me, won't me?|
91779|#821$# Ooh, this is interesting... I see.
#823$# ...Oh! I almost forgot to thank you! Thank you for your help!|
91780|Eternia's Collection II|
91781|#822$# Oh, is that you? Sorry, I was just a bit busy looking through all this.
#821$# It seems like something might be missing from the stuff you brought last time.
#823$# So, I'm afraid I'll have to bother you again.|
91782|#823$# I hope that's not too much trouble?|
91783|Eternia's secret friend|
91784|#821$# Oh, hello there. Listen, I was thinking about something, maybe you have some thoughts.
#822$# I have an old friend... I want to meet them again, but I don't know what to bring along as a gift...
#823$# What would you humans give?|
91785|#821$# Really? And you say that makes people happy?
#823$# I see, okay then. I hope she likes it! We'll see what happens.|
91786|Eternia's Gourmet Feast|
91787|#821$# Ayako always looks so happy when she's eating.
#822$# Is the food in Terra really so delicious? I've never seen anyone look so happy just for some food.|
91788|#821$# Hm...? What's this? Is it for me?
#823$# ... Oh, wow, now I understand why Ayako is so obsessed with these things. Thank you!
#2$# Oh... I must put down my daily diary entry.|
91789|Eternia's Library Maintenance|
91790|#821$# You're just in time! I need some help.
#822$# We let Diao Chan come visit the library... It didn't go so well.
#821$# What a mess! She destroyed everything.|
91791|#823$# You just can't trust some people.
#821$# I guess I won't be inviting anyone over for a while.|
91792|Eternia's Guardian Knight|
91793|#821$# I never knew our bond could grow so strong!
#823$# I'm so happy we've grown so close.|
91794|#823$# Thank you for being my knight.
#2$# This is a moment worth remembering. I must put it in today's diary entry. It's so touching, I might cry!|
91795|Yumikaze's Charisma|
91796|#821$# Diao Chan always tells me that if only I would put a little effort into my style, then I could attract a lover...
#823$# But I'm not sure. What do you think?|
91797|#825$# How's this outfit?
#821$# That good, huh. I guess I'll give up. I'll never be like Diao Chan.|
91798|Yumikaze & Ruffles I|
91799|#822$# Do you know the eagle's favorite food?
#821$# I don't have so much time for fishing these days... I need to find a substitute fisherman... |
91800|#821$# Is this for me? But I don't need this!
#825$# What? Oh, it's for Ruffles! Haha...sorry, I misunderstood.|
91801|Yumikaze & Ruffles II|
91802|#823$# Surprisingly enough, Ruffles liked the food you brought for him last time!
#821$# But his real favorite food is fish, do you know where to get some?|
91803|#823$# Ruffles just adored the fish you gave him! Thank you so much!
#2$# You chose really well. Looks like you made yourself a new friend!|
91804|Yumikaze's Food Query|
91805|#822$# Sorry... Do you have a spare minute? There's something I've been meaning to ask.
#821$# Do you know what it was that Ayako was eating before?|
91806|#825$# Whoa, is that for me? Really?
#823$# Wow, that's so generous! I'll bring it to Ruffles!|
91807|Yumikaze's Battle Gear|
91808|#822$# Who's there? Oh! It's you! Ruffles and I were just about to start a Battle Training session!
#823$# Do you want to join? You might want to get changed... we go pretty hard.|
91809|#823$# Oh! Here. You won't need to worry about getting injured with these on!
#821$# Come on! I'll try to take it easy on you.|
91810|Yumikaze's Mission|
91811|#821$# Master, my sole mission is to protect you.
#824$# Everything else is secondary! But I never asked your opinion on our relationship.
#824$# Perhaps you think I'm too protective? Or too needy?|
91812|#825$# Master... What do you mean?
#823$# Oh, I see! From now on, I will be counting on you!|
91813|Zephyrine's Mini-Game|
91814|#821$#Master, are you in a bad mood? Do you want to play a little game with me?
#822$#It's a treasure hunt challenge!
#823$#Nakama has hidden a few things around. Do you think you can find them? Heehee...|
91815|#823$#You're too good! Nakama can't have hidden them that well...
#822$#It won't be so easy next time!|
91816|Zephyrine's Handicraft 1|
91817|#823$#Do you like the accessories I'm wearing?
#821$#Nakama and I made them all ourselves by hand!
#822$#I'll make one for you too if you'd like.|
91818|#822$#Thank you, Master! Are these materials for me?
#823$#I'm so happy!
#824$#But there won't be enough to make three...|
91819|Zephyrine's Handicraft 2|
91820|#821$#I'd really love to make a few more of these...
#822$#But the materials you gave me last time just won't be enough.
#823$#Could you find some more for me?|
91821|#821$#You're the best!
#823$#Then you can wear an accessory just like Nakama's and mine.
#822$#Just wait and see!|
91822|Tasting Zephyrine's Dish|
91823|#822$#Did you know, Master? The last time I played with Ayako,
#821$#the food that Ayako ate looked so good.
#823$#I want to try it for myself. What do you think?|
91824|#823$#Is this for me?
#821$#I'm so happy! So that's what it tastes like...
#822$#It tastes good, but I'd really like to try making a dish of my own.|
91825|Zephyrine's Mysterious Music|
91826|#822$#Do you like music at all? Nakama and I both love it...
#821$#Would you like to watch Nakama and me perform? Heehee...
#823$#If you can find the right musical instrument, Nakama will perform for you.|
91827|#823$#You want to hear it? You must first understand the meaning behind the music.
#821$#This musical score was written to lead the dead using the power of their souls.
#823$#Lead them where? To the next life, of course!|
91828|Zephyrine's Promise|
91829|#821$#Master, are you afraid of judgment? You're not scared, right?
#822$#I do hope that we'll see each other again in the next life.
#823$#If you want that too, we should try to strengthen our bond while we have time!|
91830|#823$#I know you'd hate to part with your little Zephyrine.
#821$#Then Nakama and I will always be with you no matter what, and we'll be able to help you on your judgment day too.
#822$#Nakama! Don't tell anyone I said that!|
91831|Dante's Trials|
91832|#821$#What's that? Do you need help with something?
#822$#If you want my help, you need a certain amount of strength.
#821$#Why don't you go find these items to prove your worth.|
91833|#823$#Faster than I imagined... I see... Well if I have anything, I'll come find you.|
91834|Dante's Weapon Maintenance 1|
91835|#821$#Oh, it's you. I'm just doing some maintenance on Darkflame... This tachi is a creation of dark magic!
#822$#Since you're here, here's a few things I want to get rid of.|
91836|#824$#Too slow! Are you ready now?
#821$#Forget it... I have something else I need you to do. Get ready.|
91837|Dante's Weapon Maintenance 2|
91838|#821$#That's about right... Let's go test this blade out.
#822$#Go where? I'm sure even your puny human brain can figure something out.|
91839|#821$#Not bad... I can feel souls pulsing from within Darkflame...
#823$#Haha! Not bad, human.|
91840|Dante's Gourmet Experience|
91841|#822$#Food that I like? I have no interest in things from your Terra.
#821$#If you must bring something, then make sure it's fit for someone of my caliber!|
91842|#821$#... Oh? I never would have imagined that humans understood how to cook. How surprising.
#823$#If we have the chance, you should try the food from my underworld. Haha, like we'd ever go there!|
91843|Dante's Doubts|
91844|#821$#Why do you humans like to fish so much?
#822$#Human behavior is so difficult to understand. If you want fish, why don't you just go to the market and buy it?|
91845|#823$#A special reward... I see. That is interesting!
#824$#That said, human... why don't you scram! You stink like fish...|
91846|Dante's Oath|
91847|#821$#Human, I concede that you're quite talented for a mere mortal. I'll give you a chance.
#822$#In exchange for your loyalty, I vow to share my power with you.|
91848|#821$#Pledge your life, and I will follow you forever. That's fine by you, right?
#823$#Haha... You really do have some character. Perhaps that's why you were chosen!|
91849|Faust's Pursuit of Truth 1|
91850|#821$#Beauty is truth, truth beauty...
#823$#I've heard there are many beautiful ores in this world. I think they should work great.|
91851|#824$#Oh! Sorry to bother you with this! This malachite necklace represents my heart.
#822$#I think it will inspire beauty in you... Oh! Don't drop it!|
91852|Faust's Pursuit of Truth 2|
91853|#822$#Listen to me... This no longer guarantees that your gifts will be processed!
#824$#This craftsmanship seems to be... No, I mean I want to see the beauty of human craftsmanship!|
91854|#823$#Did you make this for me? Ahhh... The workmanship is remarkable!
#822$#You really are unmatched, both in terms of skill and personality!|
91855|Faust's Study of Life|
91856|#821$#I experienced what I thought was a full life. Yet as I was about to die... I still couldn't define the essence of life.
#824$#Human life is so profound... Maybe I can learn a thing or two about life by eating living things!|
91857|#822$#What is that you're preparing? The textures! The flavors! They delight the palate and satisfy the soul...
#823$#I see. I've pondered the matter... It's your love for me, right?|
91858|Faust's Curiosity|
91859|#821$#Even though I spent my miserable life absorbing raw knowledge, there were still so many things I never experienced.
#822$#I've heard that there are many types of fish in this world, and special fishing equipment too. I'd really like to see some.|
91860|#822$#I've never anything like this! It's great! Please allow me to write this down!
#823$#Of course, I'll note that you made it for me! Huh? Why aren't you writing?|
91861|Faust's Magic Research|
91862|#822$#Since Master has given me such selfless love, I want to better understand the world you grew up in.
#823$#I've explored many subjects, but I didn't get too far with alchemy...|
91863|#823$#Ah... How could such a delicate wisdom crystal cause people to shudder in fear ?
#822$#I think I understand it... Eureka!|
91864|Faust's Utopia|
91865|#821$#Everything I ever did was centered around creating a utopia, but I still failed.
#824$#I want to create this utopia with you, but maybe all I can bring about is destruction...|
91866|#822$#This... I understand. The security and warmth that you give me is the true meaning of utopia.
#823$#I'll do everything I can to protect this utopia until the very end.|
91867|Harmonia's Polish Recipe 1|
91868|#821$#Taking care of your jewelry is just like exercise. You have to do it every day.
#822$#Ah! It's time to polish my gold necklace again. Yes? How did my potion bottle break?
#824$#... We have nothing to wipe it down with... What should we do?..|
91869|#824$#... What to do... Yes? What is this?! Did you go find this just for me?!
#823$#Ah! I'm so happy! It's amazing... I'm so moved!
#821$#There's not enough water... I need some other things too...|
91870|Harmonia's Polish Recipe 2|
91871|#821$#Pearls, gems, metals... These things are all precious.
#823$#If you want to take care of them, you need more than just purified water. You need something special to bring out their shine and enhance their abilities.|
91872|#823$#Amazing! You move so quickly! In the past, only nobles and royalty could use it.
#822$#Hurry and add it to the water, okay? Ah! No, I just want to drink it!
#821$#While taking care of your jewelry, it's important to stay positive.|
91873|Harmonia's Values|
91874|#821$#Ding... It looks like it's time to retune my harp again.
#822$#But there are no harp experts here. There's no one to bring me the tuning tools, either.
#824$#If this continues, my harp's melodies will become more and more inaccurate! What should I do?|
91875|#823$#I'm really sorry to make you take another trip...
#822$#I think I saw you give your weapon to someone else. Does that person fix your weapons for you?
#824$#Huh? You have to pay money?! You don't have a personal servant to do that?|
91876|Harmonia's Extravagant Feast|
91877|#822$#What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?
#821$#You're hungry? Then let's get ready to eat! Why do you look so reluctant?
#823$#No food? Then let's have some snacks first.|
91878|#823$#These snacks are quite tasty. Maybe we can prepare some for tomorrow too and try those!
#822$#So there's nothing we can do without money? Snacks cost money too?!
#824$#How upsetting... How am I supposed to throw a tea party like this?|
91879|Harmonia's Concert Invitation|
91880|#821$#I've been thinking about something a lot lately. Can I tell you about it?
#823$#I always wanted to meet someone like you who shared my values and interests. That way we could hold our own concert.
#822$#Will you reply to my invitation?|
91881|#824$#So you were making them in secret? I had no idea!
#823$#I'm sorry... but I just feel so happy!
#823$#Haha! Let's go into the atrium. The concert will be a beautiful memory for both of us!|
91882|Harmonia's Vow|
91883|#821$#These days that I've spent with you may be some of the best of my life.
#823$#I hope we can stay together forever...
#821$#If you're willing, will you take a solemn vow with me?|
91884|#823$#Ha! Really? I'm happy that you feel the same way!
#821$#Let's go make some more memories together!|
91885|Zashi's Dessert I|
91886|#821$#Zzzzzz... Ah! I fell asleep again... *Yawn*...
#824$#Hmm... I must be hungry...
#825$#Master, could you please find me some dessert?|
91887|#823$#Wow, look at this spread! Thank you, Master!
#825$#I'm not sure I can eat it all... Master, would you like to join me?|
91888|Zashi's Dessert II|
91889|#822$#Ayako says that there are many different types of desserts in Terra.
#823$#She also says that there are hundreds of flavors of candy... Hmm... I'm so curious about them...|
91890|#825$#Yum, yum... Wow! This is delicious...
#822$#I'd really like to learn how to prepare these desserts!
#823$#I'd be able to make some for us, master!|
91891|Zashi's Broom|
91892|#822$#Master, did you hear that a new generation of cleaning tools has been released?
#824$#I want one so much, but I don't have enough money...
#821$#Maybe I can make one myself! Perhaps I could use a fishing pole as a component...|
91893|#823$#Excellent! I can definitely make a new broom out of it.
#821$#I'm pretty tired at the moment, though. Maybe I should take a nap first...|
91894|Zashi's Inspiration|
91895|#822$#I'd like to design a new look for Orbie.
#821$#I'm feeling quite sleepy these days, and I still have no clue what kind of pattern to use.
#825$#I could definitely use some inspiration...|
91896|#823$#Is this for me? Thank you, master!
#822$#Heehee... Orbie will be so happy!|
91897|Zashi's Blanket|
91898|#824$#I've been feeling a little chilly in bed these days.
#821$#It turns out my blanket had a big hole in it!
#824$#Achoo! I'm freezing... If I don't darn my blanket, I'll catch a cold!|
91899|#823$#You're so kind, master!
#822$#I'm so lucky to have you!|
91900|Zashi's Bond|
91901|#823$#I love being with you, master!
#824$#I hope it stays like this forever...
#821$#Do you think it's possible for us to have an even deeper bond?|
91902|#823$#Thank you, master...
#822$#Now our bond is stronger than ever!
#823$#We'll be together forever!|
91903|Muse's Booster|
91904|#821$#What is it, master? You say I'm looking less than energetic?
#822$#Come to think of it, I am feeling a little flat...|
91905|#821$#What is this? Did you prepare this for me, master?
#824$#Thank you so much!|
91906|Muse's Dance Routine|
91907|#823$#Haha! Check out these moves! It's all part of my dance practice.
#821$#Dancing is a great way to stay fit. Also... It's a way to show off without looking like a showoff!
#823$#Whoops! You didn't hear that, right? I'd better get back to dancing!|
91908|#824$#Is this what I think it is? Thank you so much! I won't let you down!|
91909|Muse's Concert I|
91910|#821$#I want to have a concert so more people can hear my voice!
#822$#First of all, I need to tune up my instrument. Could you please help me, master?|
91911|#823$#Wow... I didn't expect to finish so quickly!
#821$#Would you mind helping me with my other hundred instruments, too?
#824$#What? You don't like me anymore?|
91912|Muse's Concert II|
91913|#822$#Finally, I'm almost ready! Only one thing left to do...
#821$#A performer's outfit is of critical importance when it comes to drawing a crowd!
#822$#Hmm... I could use one more accessories right here...|
91914|#823$#What a beautiful gem! I'll put it to good use!
#822$#It's perfect! I'll reserve the best seat in the house for you, master! I'll see you at the concert!|
91915|Muse's Variety|
91916|#822$#My recent performances have been missing something.
#824$#I wonder what I can do to mix things up...|
91917|#821$#Hmm? You say this can bring something fresh to my act? All right...
#823$#YEAH! EEEEVERYONE! ARE YOU REAAAADY?!
#824$#No, no, no... That didn't feel like me...|
91918|Muse's Optimism|
91919|#821$#I want to help everyone I can, but sometimes I feel like there's nothing I can do...
#824$#After all, singing and dancing can't fix every problem. What do you think, master?|
91920|#824$#This is... Thank you, master!
#823$#I get it! I just have to stay positive!
#822$#That shouldn't be hard with you by my side...|
91921|Lumikki's Routine|
91922|#824$#Humph! They are so short. Why can't they be longer? Meeeeeeeeh!
#822$#What's short? No... nothing! You must have heard the wind or something.
#824$#It's not like I think my bangs are too short or something like that.|
91923|#821$#Protein is good for my hair?
#824$#Master, do you feel that my bangs are too short?
#823$#They're cute? Yay! You are the best, Master!|
91924|Lumikki's Staff|
91925|#821$#"Prudent masters keep their weapons in pristine condition."
#822$#That's what Astraea told me. She also told me that simply cleaning my weapon isn't enough.
#824$#But I don't know what else I can do...|
91926|#821$#Flowers? Are these flowers for me? You think I should grind them in water and then polish my staff with the mixture?
#822$#Hmm... I'll give it a try!
#823$#Wow! It shines as though it were brand new! You are so great, Master!|
91927|Lumikki's Forgetfulness|
91928|#823$#La la la! A little bit here first, then I'll clean a bit there. La di da da da da da! Finally, it's clean again!
#822$#What was I doing? Oh, I was cleaning my staff! What's its name?
#824$#It has SUCH a beautiful name! Which is... eh... what is it again?|
91929|#824$#Boooooo... I can't remember... I'm so hungry, Master!
#823$#Wow, how did you know that I was hungry? Yum yum yum! It tastes delicious! Thank you, Master!
#824$#The name of the staff? Ehrr... I still can't remember...|
91930|Lumikki's Dream I|
91931|#821$#I had a dream about a prince.
#822$#He was wearing a top hat and wearing a sleek suit. He was... dashing!
#823$#I wish I had such a fashionable costume. Then I could give it to the prince as a gift. Could you help me with that, Master?|
91932|#823$#Wow! Thank you, Master! You're the best! |
91933|Lumikki's Dream II|
91934|#821$#The costume you gave me last time is fraying apart...
#824$#What should I do? I can't give it as a present in this condition.|
91935|#821$#This is...? How did you know that I would need this?
#823$#I'm so happy! So so happy!
#822$#Now I can give it to... erhm... never mind!|
91936|Lumikki's Confession|
91937|#822$#My biggest dream is to meet my prince charming...
#821$#It'll be just like in the fairy tales.
#823$#Master, will you help me fulfill my wish?|
91938|#822$#Thank you, Master! But, there's something I've never told you...
#823$#My prince charming is... is... is you.
#821$#I hope you won't hold that against me, please!|
91939|Tyr's weapon research|
91940|#821$# I heard there are many different minerals in the human world. Maybe some of them can be used for weapons. #823$# It must be fun to try building with different materials!|
91941|#822$#¡KDid you find this? I, I didn't ask you to do such things! #821$# But since you have brought them, I hate to see them wasted!|
91942|Tyr's Pride|
91943|#821$# Well, who can compete with my nobility, the One-Handed God of War? #822$#¡KWhat's that look? Origin and intrinsic ability are the most important traits! #824$# Height... is nothing!|
91944|#822$#¡KI won't thank you for this! #821$# What? Baeldor did this to become taller? Well, I'll try it ...|
91945|Tyr's Receipe Study|
91946|#824$# Fenrir wants to try something new... Didn't he like the biscuits before? #821$# I heard there is a wide range of ingredients in the human world. #822$# If I can get it, I may be able to create a new recipe.|
91947|#823$# Oh! These are the ingredients from the human world... Fenrir will be thrilled! #824$# Well, I'm thanking you on his behalf.|
91948|Tyr's Family Task I|
91949|#822$# Damn, something is missing... I won't be able to finish this task for my family! #824$# I can't imagine how disappointed Father Odin will be...|
91950|#824$# This... Did you find this? Who told you to do such a dangerous thing! #821$#¡KAnyway, I will talk to Father Odin. It's an shared honor.|
91951|Tyr's Family Task II|
91952|#821$# Eh? I am about to go out. I am assigned with a new family task. #824$# No, this is important. Well, I have to prepare. Quiet!|
91953|#822$# This... Well... You don't have to do this...
#821$# I'm not going to die. There are people counting on me. #824$# I don't need your help. No, it's ok. Well ... Anyway ... thanks ...|
91954|Tyr's Enlightenment|
91955|#824$#¡KNot yet. I'm not strong enough! #821$# I need to be stronger! In the name of the God of War... for the people I need to protect...|
91956|#824$# Are you trying to comfort me? You don't have to.
#821$#¡KBut that's who you are... I won't lose to you! Listen, I am the One-Handed God of War Tyr! I will be stronger and protect you!|
91957|Pandora's Magic Research|
91958|#823$#Justinia helped make my bag. She did a wonderful job!
#824$#But she also built a threshold that she can never cross...
#821$#You're my servant, think of something! Consider it a test!|
91959|#824$#Are you sure this will help? It won't hurt me, will it?
#821$#... I guess I have to trust you.|
91960|Pandora's Love Plan I|
91961|#824$#Dante seems so sad lately... He doesn't smile nearly as much as he used to.
#821$#That Fire Angel must have hurt his feelings! How terrible!
#824$#Hm... But if I get rid of him, then Dante will be sad... What should I do?|
91962|#823$#You're cleverer than you look! I'll have to remember that...|
91963|Pandora's Love Plan II|
91964|#824$# What? Ah... The Fire Angel is badly hurt...
#821$#... I miiiight have added some spicy powder to his drink...
#824$#What do I do?! If he dies and Dante finds out why, he'll never forgive me! Oh no, no, no...|
91965|#824$# What? You want me to heal that Fire Angel? I suppose I'd better do it before Dante finds out...
#821$#Hmmph... If he's cured, maybe Dante will finally stop asking about him.
#823$#Okay! That's a good point. I'm listening.|
91966|Pandora's Love Life|
91967|#824$#Oh, no no no... Dante is going to see that damned Fire Angel!
#821$#If things keep going like this, he'll take Dante away from me!
#824$#I've got to think of something... Some way to make sure Dante only pays attention to me!|
91968|#821$#So efficient - that's why you're my servant!
#823$#This is sure to get Dante's attention!
#825$#Oh, my beautiful Dante...I hope he notices me...|
91969|Pandora's Secret to Pets|
91970|#822$#You've probably guessed that there's something special about my Lassie.
#823$#For one thing, she eats a special formula that I make just for her.
#821$#If you want to, I suppose I could let you make it this one time...|
91971|#823$#You've passed the test! We can be friends!|
91972|Pandora's Past and Present|
91973|#824$#Even though it happened so long ago, it feels like it was yesterday.
#821$#I just wanted to find someone who would never leave me.
#822$#... You might be my friend now, but... You... You'll leave me one day, won't you?|
91974|#823$#... I...I received your gift. Thank you... Thank you for being my friend in spite of everything.|
91975|Kitami's Water Test|
91976|#821$#Do you want to play by the water? Oh! Are we going there now?
#824$#Phew! It's chilly!|
91977|#823$#Did you get this out of the water? Master! Let's catch more!
#821$# But... I might need you to show me how...|
91978|Kitami's Grooming|
91979|#824$#Oh, my hair's gotten so dirty...
#824$#How am I supposed to keep it clean? I thought combing it every day would be enough?!|
91980|#821$#Master...? What? Is this for me to use?
#823$#Wow! Look how shiny it made my hair! Oh, Master, you're the best!|
91981|Kitami's Ready to Battle I|
91982|#822$#Where are you going, Master? What? A fight?
#821$#I'm going with you!
#824$# But... But... I... I'm afraid of getting hurt...|
91983|#821$#This is lovely! Is it...is it for me?
#824$#Oh, M-Master... Master is so thoughtful to give this to me... I must keep fighting!|
91984|Kitami's Ready to Battle II|
91985|#822$#Wow! Amazing! I'm ready to fight!
#821$#I'll be right in the thick of the battle! I'll do anything to protect Master!!
#824$# Personally, if you ask me, Am I making too much noise? Sob... I hope the enemy doesn't see me...|
91986|#821$#Oh! Master's so smart! That way no one will see me!
#824$# Who's there? Oh! Why are you leaving? Aren't you coming with you?
#824$#Y-You're staying behind? Sob... Master, you're so mean...|
91987|Feeding Kitami|
91988|#822$#Blup... glup... brrrup...
#821$#What was that? Where's that sound coming from? Is it from Kitami's tummy?
#824$#Meow... I... I guess I'm hungry...|
91989|#823$#Wow - thank you, Master! These are my favorite! I'll eat them all up!
#821$#What? Me? Eat like a cat? Never!|
91990|Kitami's Power of Courage|
91991|#821$#For my Master... I must become stronger!
#824$#I have to be strong enough to stay by Master's side forever!|
91992|#821$#I understand Master better than anyone! I want to be with Master forever and ever.
#823$#I love Master the most!|
91993|Connection with Undine.|
91994|#821$#Co- co- co- connecting!
#822$#... Why can't I connect nowadays?
#825$#I have loads of questions to ask Him...|
91995|#821$#Huh? Those tiny fish?
#822$#Did you send them to console me?
#823$#Aww, you're the best! No wonder our souls are connected!|
91996|Undine's painkiller.|
91997|#822$#... If I try to walk like you, my feet will start to hurt
#825$#as if I am walking on glass... How can you endure such a pain?
#822$#Seems like you've been suffering for a long time... I gotta do something for you!|
91998|#823$#Look here! This is my signature formula for painkillers!
#821$#Quick now! Take it! It'll make the pain go away. Well, most of it...|
91999|Undine's Dream.|
92000|#821$#I had a dream about you.
#823$#In my dream you were eating the mandarinfish very, very gently.
#824$#I wonder I why would have such a dream...|
92001|#823$#Hmm? Are you going to share that with me?
#821$#Hmm? Is that Fish?
#823$#Are you trying to tell me something? I don't think I like the implication...|
92002|Undine's Curse.|
92003|#821$#Why are you always looking at other people?
#822$#No? But... You just looked at that guy!
#824$#I'll have to curse him! Why? I must have you undivided attention!|
92004|#821$#Why don't you want me to do it?
#825$#Are you saying it doesn't mean anything?|
92005|Undine's Curse (cont).|
92006|#825$#I just want to be the center of your attention...
#825$#Can't you understand that? My heart hurts... is this what being heartbroken is like?|
92007|#822$#*sob* Master? Is that for me?
#823$#Oh, I am so relieved! Does that mean you will stick with me?|
92008|Undine's Eternity.|
92009|#822$#Temptation always lurk just around the corner!
#824$#The mere thought of you falling for it...
#823$#But don't you worry! I'll always be there to look our for you!|
92010|#821$#Such a beautiful soul... It shines like the sun itself.
#823$#Could that... Could that mean we're meant to be?
#823$#This is great news! I'm so excited! I almost don't believe it!|
92011|Verdandi's Trick.|
92012|#821$#I've heard there is a type of ugly looking leech that makes people scream uncontrollably!
#822$#Did you know about this? Those things live in water... Ew!|
92013|#821$#Ha! Just like this leech here. I see you're not afraid of them. Good!
#823$#I would like to see you in shock actually... What a pity.|
92014|Verdandi's Gardening|
92015|#822$#I am a little bit unsettled that I haven't been watering the World Tree ever since I left home...
#821$#Hm... Would you like me to help you take care of the farm in the Estate?|
92016|#821$#Are these... For watering the plants?
#822$#Ha! Seems to me that gardening isn't really your forte.
#823$#Okay then, let's just try first. And then I'll teach you how to do it properly!|
92017|Verdandi's Web of Fate|
92018|#821$#The web connecting the beginning and the end of a life is related to fate obviously.
#822$#Do you believe in fate?|
92019|#822$#Are these... Do you want me to make you a new web?
#821$#Okay, but you can't look at me while I'm doing it! Otherwise I'll go home!
#823$#Ha ha ha, just kidding. Your web is fine as it is. No other can compare to it.|
92020|Verdandi's Puppet|
92021|#822$#Clara's regular maintenance is very important.
#821$#The sight of these broken parts makes me sad...|
92022|#821$#Hm... Are these for Clara?
#823$#Ha! These aren't even close to the branches from the World Tree, but they'll do I guess.|
92023|Verdandi's Puppet (cont).|
92024|#822$#However, apart from the limbs, internal repair is the most important part.
#821$#Fate thread is of the utmost importance! Without those lively soul-filled threads...
#824$#Clara would just be a regular puppet...|
92025|#821$#Exactly! These are exactly what I need. You're very fast!
#823$#Ha! I guess I should reward you!|
92026|Verdandi's Present|
92027|#821$#Now that we have each other, do you still look back on the past or wonder about the future?
#824$#Their temptation is greater than the present'a, I'll grant you that...|
92028|#821$#Do you care about the present the same way? Ha! I knew I was right in choosing you.
#823$#We're clearly on the same page, so let's enjoy this!|
92029|Justicia's Order|
92030|#821$#Here's an order for an igniter, and here's another for a couple of custom tempered steel rings.
#824$#Yes... I used up the last of my materials on the last batch of bullets...
#824$#I can't just issue a refund... There's got to be something I can use.|
92031|#821$#Oh? This material is really high-quality, and the color is flawless.
#823$#Nice eye! Maybe you've got the making of a talented weaponsmith in you!|
92032|Justicia's Love|
92033|#821$#Is love... really that amazing?
#822$#Yes... I really just don't understand... How can an emotion change someone so drastically?
#825$#I wish there was a potion or something that could make people understand love...|
92034|#822$#Sweet, but bitter at the same time. Is this what it feels like to be in love?
#823$#Yes... I still don't think I really understand what love is like, but in any case this tastes pretty delicious!
#821$#I think Alucard would probably like it too! Could you bring him some too next time?|
92035|Justicia's Weapon Maintenance|
92036|#822$#Whew, that's it for the orders for now. Time to start weapon maintenance for the day!
#823$#If you're not doing anything, maybe you could lend a hand.
#822$#I just looked over everything, and it looks like I'm missing a couple of things. Think you can help out?|
92037|#821$#Just in time! I just finished polishing all the weapons.
#822$#Next come the repairs, but I can't get started without a few more things.
#823$#If we work together, it'll go a lot faster!|
92038|Justicia's Research|
92039|#821$#Even weapons that look alike are unique to the person who crafts them.
#822$#No two weapons are exactly the same.
#823$#Still, it's important that I study the work of other weaponsmiths so I can develop new designs.|
92040|#821$#Wow, this one turned out pretty good! Just a couple little defects...
#822$#I could use this one as a prototype and make a few modifications here and there...|
92041|Justicia's Research Continued|
92042|#823$#I've decided to take things in a new direction!
#822$#First, we're going to need to split up to prepare the necessary materials.
#822$#You'll be responsible for these ones. See you in a bit!|
92043|#822$#Let's see... One, two, three... It looks like we've got everything we need!
#823$#I've got a feeling that people are going to be blown away once this is finished.
#823$#Thanks so much for your help! Best of luck out there!|
92044|Justicia and the Executioner|
92045|#821$#Traveling with you has been fantastic!
#822$#Not only did we make excellent progress with our weaponsmithing, we also made significant improvements in battle.
#823$#Would you consider sticking together a while longer?|
92046|#822$#Very well, then. I shall pass judgement upon you! The sentence shall be thus:
#823$#We will continue to work hard to help one another, to grow together, and to protect one another.
#821$#No objections have been raised by the ruling!|
92047|Michaela's Memory|
92048|#821$#Do you know anything about this fruit? Its flowers grow inside.
#821$#It exudes an alluring aroma underwater.|
92049|#821$#This is the one. My companions and I used to use Common Figs to catch fish at the Holy River.
#822$#... That's in the past... There's no going back to those times.|
92050|Michaela's Quiet Time|
92051|#821$#My sword and I must continue to exterminate evil wherever we find it. I can't stray from this mission.
#824$#Though the war may be in the past, there's still much work to be done.|
92052|#821$#... Oh, am I worrying you? I'll take this time to rest.|
92053|Michaela's Expression Training|
92054|#821$#Every time I muster the courage to speak with people they look scared.
#822$#My expression? Do you think it's because I look so serious?|
92055|#822$#Really? This will make it easier to find friends?

92262|#823$#Of course! From now on you can always count on my brothers and I!
#823$#You'll be our master forever!|
92263|Idun's Human World Experience|
92264|#821$#Idun loves fruits. I always eat Golden Apples in my hometown!
#823$#Hmm? You want Idun to try human fruit? Idun is really looking forward to tasting them!|
92265|#822$#It's fragrant and juicy, and different fruits have different aromas.
#823$#Hmm, fruits from the human world are so exotic, I'd like to try more!|
92266|Idun's Cooking Experience|
92267|#821$#There are so many delicious fruits in the human world, let's cook something with them!
#822$#Let's add this...Then stir it afterwards...
#824$#Huh? It became a lump of mashed fruit...It failed...|
92268|#822$#Did you make these? Huh, I thought it failed!
#821$#...So it will take shape after a while!
#823$#Let's try it now! Yum! "How unique!"|
92269|Idun's Acres 1|
92270|#821$#Idun wants to own a huge Golden Apple orchard in the human world too!
#822$#But the soil is different from the one in Idun's hometown, I wonder if it works...
#821$#Why don't you help Idun collect the things we need?|
92271|#823$#Exactly! These are the things I want!
#822$#For fruit trees, nutritious soil and a stable bind are the most important things.|
92272|Idun's Acres 2|
92273|#821$#After a good fruit tree foundation, there are other important parts!
#822$#Do you know what that is? Heehee!|
92274|#823$#You're incredible! Fruit Trees can't grow well without water and nutrients!
#823$#Now we just have to wait for them to grow...|
92275|Idun's Orchard Harvest|
92276|#823$#Heehee, Idun's Golden Apple orchard is bearing lots of huge Golden apples!
#821$#Do you want to harvest them too? Hmm, not in what you're wearing!|
92277|#822$#That's right, you need a proper outfit for harvesting!
#821$#Hmm, it tastes different compared to home...
#824$#Is it impossible to grow Golden Apples in the human world?|
92278|Idun's Eternity|
92279|#821$#Idun sees humans on earth changing and forgetting the people around them...
#824$#Will you be like them? Will you forget about Idun...?|
92280|#821$#Even though your face will change with the passage of time,
#821$#you'll still be by my side, right? You won't forget Idun, right?
#823$#Idun will always be by your side!
#822$#Or do you just want to steal a taste of the Golden Apple?|
92281|Nidhogg's Fangs|
92282|#821$#Yes? Do you want to help me with something?
#822$#Hahaha, do you think you can help me?
#821$#To prove your worth, find something as awesome as my fangs.|
92283|#821$#This is a world away from my fangs.
#822$#I admit you tried hard. I'll let you pass this time.|
92284|Nidhogg's Food|
92285|#821$#The food you eat is not enough to satisfy me.
#822$#What do I eat? I don't eat the same food as humans.
#821$#Only a huge amount of food can satisfy me!|
92286|#822$#Hahaha, the souls of the dead are so delicious.|
92287|Nidhogg's Banquet 1|
92288|#821$#I've talked so much! Now I'm starving!
#824$#Ah, I like a good slaughter when I'm hungry. Humans are annoying!|
92289|#822$#You're fast. What are these?
#824$#Ugh, how sweet! Is this even food?!|
92290|Nidhogg's Banquet 2|
92291|#821$#Your taste in food is horrible...
#822$#You poor deluded thing, I'll tell you what real food is.
#821$#Real food is filled with the flavors of hate and despair.|
92292|#821$#...I'll let you pass, even though this is lowly human food.|
92293|Nidhogg's Strength|

#822$#Strength, strength above all!|
92295|#821$#Hahaha, you're very bright!
#822$#I knew it, you do have potential.|
92296|Nidhogg's Calamity|
92297|#821$#There are too many weaklings on earth...
#822$#The weak must be crushed to make space for the strong.
#821$#Am I right or am I right?|
92298|#821$#Haha! When calamity strikes, that's when true strength is needed!
#822$#We'll see who's the true warrior then!|
92299|Santa Tyr Sleigh Research|
92300|#821$#It's just a normal plank, how can it fly...
#822$#I'll solve this riddle. I pledge by my name as the God of War...
#821$#If only I had these research materials...|
92301|#823$#...Did you get these for me?
#821$#Such a nosy Human...Thank you.|
92302|Santa Tyr's Baking Materials|
92303|#822$#Someone is pining for Christmas cookies...
#821$#I guess I'll have to find the next ingredient...
#822$#By the Heroic Glory, I'm sure I'll make it happen!|
92304|#821$#So this is for the Christmas cookie, let's see...
#823$#Hah! It's done! So this is a gingerbread man!
#822$#Here you go. Why are you so shocked? You get one too!|
92305|Santa Tyr's Preparations 1|
92306|#821$#Hmm, even at a human celebration, I can't slack off!
#822$#After ample preparations, time to train!
#821$#...Preparations are always a bother.|
92307|#821$#You! When are you going to prepare?
#822$#I don't intend to thank you!|
92308|Santa Tyr's Preparations 2|
92309|#824$#That was a mistake. There are partygoers everywhere...
#821$#This will hinder my training...
#822$#Am I not prepared? No, the God of War makes no mistakes.|
92310|#821$#It's you...
#822$#You got what I needed easily...
#821$#I'm not complimenting you! Don't misunderstand!|
92311|Santa Tyr's Stocking|
92312|#821$#The Christmas stockings in the markets are so thin... Is that okay?
#822$#It doesn't fit a Heroic Glory's nobility...
#821$#Aren't there any socks that fit me? INJUSTICE!|
92313|#821$#You're always getting into danger!
#822$#And always helping me secretly...
#821$#Well, you have defended my honour...|
92314|Santa Tyr's Christmas Vows|
92315|#821$#Santa Claus making wishes come true? That's just a story for kids.
#822$#You should grant your own wishes, like me.
#823$#I have a wish, and I know I must grant it myself...|
92316|#821$#Santa Claus is just a tale told to children...
#822$#But if you believe in him, I will too.
#823$#I'll be by your side every Christmas.|
92317|Santa Ayako's new dress|
92318|#823$#Look master, Ayako has a new outfit!

92335|Qingniao's Health|
92336|#822$#Human voices...So many people...
#821$#No, it's nothing... I just feel uneasy with so many people around...|
92337|#822$#Thank you, I feel much better now... Sorry for worrying you...|
92338|Qingniao's Daily Life|
92339|#821$#...Huh? You want to take me fishing...?
#823$#I've never gone fishing. I don't have the equipment for it...|
92340|#821$#Such a beautiful Fishing Rod, is it for me?
#823$#It's my first time fishing, please guide me.|
92341|Qingniao Rescue 1|
92342|#821$#The sky is so wide! I really want the freedom to fly...
#822$#Huh? There's a weak cry in the bird's nest above...
#821$#What should we do? The baby birds will not survive...|
92343|#822$#These flowers will save them?
#821$#Thank you, I'll give it a go... Please stay alive...|
92344|Qingniao Rescue 2|
92345|#823$#I feel life in these eggs, how lovely...
#821$#The eggs are getting cold. We need something to keep them warm...|
92346|#821$#These exude a warm and sacred feeling. Let's put these eggs in together to keep them warm.
#823$#The eggs are finally warm again. Thanks so much!|
92347|Qingniao's Cage|
92348|#822$#I've been trapped for so long...
#821$#There's rust on it. Is it going to break soon...?|
92349|#823$#Is this something to repair the binds?
#821$#Thank you. Even though I hate the binds, it's a pity to see them rust.|
92350|Qingniao's Happiness|
92351|#822$#I've brought happiness to humans, but I've never figured out what happiness means to me.
#821$#Can you give me an answer?|
92352|#821$#Stay by your side and look for it together?
#823$#Please continue to look out for me in the future.|
92353|Festival Muramasa's Game|
92354|#821$#Kabuto played a game with me today and lost every round!
#822$#You know I don't lose easily, even if it's just a game.|
92355|#823$#Wha! Is this a...my prize? Thank you so much, Master! I appreciate it!|
92356|Festival Muramasa's New Threads|
92357|#823$#Master, what do you think of my new outfit? Kabuto helped pick it out!
#821$#But I get the feeling something's missing...|
92358|#823$#Yes, this is it! The gorgeous red color fits my outfit perfectly! Thank you, Master.|
92359|Festival Muramasa's Special Occasion|
92360|#821$#Whenever there's a special event going on, Kabuto always insists on dragging me out to play.
#822$#I mean, I'm glad he's happy, but I'm afraid he'll wear himself out...|
92361|#823$#Thank you, Master. Kabuto will recover nicely now. He's my most important friend.|
92362|Festival Muramasa's Sumptuous Feast (Part 1)|
92363|#824$#Gulp, gulp... Mmm? What do I want to eat to celebrate the festival?
#822$#That's easy. A nice, fat, juicy steak!|
92364|#824$#Gulp, hahhh. Now I really want some meat. Eh? What's with all this fish?
#822$#Hmm? This thickness, this juiciness... It's steak?! Am I that drunk? I can't believe I mistook steak for fish!|
92365|Festival Muramasa's Sumptuous Feast (Part 2)|
92366|#822$#Nothing rounds out a fabulous meal better than fine wine!
#824$#Gulp, gulp. Yeah, I'm a bit of a connoisseur. None of that cheap stuff for me!|
92367|#822$#Hmm, this one is pretty dry, but it's got a sweet finish. Not bad!
#824$#Gulp! Pour me another!|
92368|Festival Muramasa's Hope|
92369|#821$#I hope to finally let go of my dark past and follow you always.
#825$#Do you think such a thing is possible for a cursed being like me?|
92370|#823$#Thank you... I dedicate this next toast to you! Please allow me to remain by your side and protect you.|
92371|Elizabeth's Spa Day|
92372|#821$#Sigh! It's been work, work, work since we met.
#822$#I really must take better care of myself!
#821$#I'd kill for a nice, warm bath...|
92373|#821$#Oh, is this how you prepare a bath?
#822$#Well, it's a little different from my usual but nice all the same.
#823$#Care to join me?|
92374|Elizabeth's Cup Half Full|
92375|#821$#Hmm? That heady bouquet... Is it wine I smell?
#822$#It's been ages since I've tasted any.
#821$#Well, aren't you going to pour me some? Never mind. I have no interest in downmarket wine.|
92376|#821$#Huh? Leave it, I said.
#822$#Sigh! Very well...
#823$#Mmm. This wine is...satisfactory. Not bad, peasant.|
92377|Elizabeth's New Stylist|
92378|#821$#Another invitation? Sigh! These banquets are all the same.
#822$#Members of the court are required to socialize, but it's all so dull!
#823$#To make things interesting, I'll allow you to select my attire this time.|
92379|#821$#Hmm. Adequate, I suppose.
#822$#I admit you tried hard. I'll let you pass this time.|
92380|Elizabeth's Little Hobby (Part 1)|
92381|#823$#Some rather pretty maidens have been flittering about lately.
#821$#I'd like to play a special game with them...
#822$#Ah, but I don't have the proper tools.|
92382|#821$#These are just what I need!
#823$#Very astute, peasant. I shall reward you properly.|
92383|Elizabeth's Little Hobby (Part 2)|
92384|#821$#Sigh! No, not this one... Not this one either....
#822$#Are there not materials of better quality?
#821$#These are simply unfit for the likes of the Bazoeri clan.|
92385|#821$#Hmm? You found this?
#822$#You have a rather good eye. For a peasant.
#823$#The beautiful iron tool is complete! I can hardly wait to put it to use...|
92386|Elizabeth's Secret Aspiration|
92387|#821$#I acknowledge your taste and admire your skills.
#822$#But these alone are not enough to keep you beside me.|
92388|#823$#Oh, you've brought what I wish for the most!
#821$#Well then, I suppose I could amend my previous statement...
#822$#You are worthy of remaining by my side.|
92389|Seiryuu's Stretch|
92390|#821$#Hey friend! Want to spar for a bit?
#822$#Ahh... I think I used my shoulder too much...
#824$#That's such a rookie mistake, looks like I need more practice...|
92391|#823$#Gulp, ha! I'm alive!
#821$#Looks like you're looking forward to sparring with me as well!
#822$#As a thank you, let's go a few more rounds!|
92392|Seiryuu's Fishing Practice I|
92393|#821$#I've been training so hard lately, I should take a break more often.
#822$#The weather is pretty nice today. Should we do something special?|
92394|#821$#Ha! This Fishing Rod looks pretty good!
#823$#Well done, friend! I think I'll spend the whole day fishing!|
92395|Seiryuu's Fishing Practice II|
92396|#821$#Calm yourself... keep at it. Victory will be ours!
#822$#This is definitely more difficult than sparring...|
92397|#821$#Was this left here for me to find?
#823$#Thank you, friend. Success will be ours in the end!|
92398|Seiryuu's Treat|
92399|#821$#The town granny is getting ready to move somewhere new.
#822$#She needs some real muscle to help her.
#821$#But the day is almost gone already... I don't think I ate at all today...|
92400|#823$#Ha! You totally get me!
#821$#This is exactly what I was craving today.
#823$#Come, come! Come and sit so we can share.|
92401|Seiryuu's Battlefield Support|
92402|#821$#The Demons have been agitated lately... Have you noticed it?
#822$#Let's figure out what we can do to support our heroes on the battlefield!|
92403|#821$#Are we even ready to get them what they need?
#823$#That's a great idea! Good one! I'm proud of you!|
92404|Seiryuu's Benevolence|
92405|#821$#The world is a big place, and there are many people in need...
#822$#If you're willing...
#821$#How about we move forward together?|
92406|#821$#I can see you have a kind heart.
#823$#Thank you for helping me! From now on, we'll share everything.|
92407|Aoandon's Maiden Complex|
92408|#821$#Hmm... What exactly does it take to be a girl?
#822$#Do you know? What makes a human girl a girl?|
92409|#821$#Do flowers represent a girl? Ah... The lamp has burned the petals...
#823$#Nevertheless, their ashes still give off a sweet fragrance. Is this what a girl smells like?|
92410|Aoandon's Nighttime Routine|
92411|#821$#The quiet hours of the night are really the best.

#823$#Haha, what kind of line is that? I can think of something even better...|
92413|Aoandon's Lantern Watch|
92414|#821$#Huh...? Why is this lantern's candle so dim...?
#822$#If it's just going to flicker out... Then there won't be any stories tonight...|
92415|#821$#This is... Well, let me try to fix it.
#823$#Great... The light is shining brightly again... You can now continue telling stories.|
92416|Aoandon's Strange Stories|
92417|#821$#Hmm... Shall we play the storytelling game tonight?
#822$#Hmm... But I've heard many strange tales, so your story needs to be really interesting.|
92418|#821$#We could even write a book about our adventures! A life haunted by resentful souls?
#823$#Hmm... It's pretty good material for a story. Quickly, write it down.|
92419|Aoandon's Unbelievable Monster Story|

#823$#What? It's no good for body-building? Ha-ha-ha! I just like drinking it! Glug-glug!|
92449|Ares' Dietary Habits (2)|
92450|#821$#Okay, I'll stop teasing you. Now, I'll tell you seriously.
#822$#The meat that grow meats. Is the clue clear enough for you?|
92451|#821$#That was quick! I like you, youngster.
#823$#Eat these, and train well, and you'll become like me.|
92452|Ares' Campaign Preparations|
92453|#821$#The armor is very sturdy! Hmm, very good!
#822$#...What am I going on about? The final preparations for the battle, of course!|
92454|#821$#I don't need these, I'm strong enough as I am. But thanks anyway!|
92455|Ares After the Battle|
92456|#823$#Ha-ha-ha! Once again I was awesome on the battlefield!
#821$#Are you curious about the battlefield? I'll give you the benefit of my knowledge and experience.|
92457|#821$#These items were left by the defeated!
#823$#Me? All I left on the battlefield was another chapter in the legend of me!|
92458|Ares' Brutal Ambition|
92459|#821$#I'm sure you understand the enormity of my excellence by now.
#822$#How about we team up and become unstoppable? Rush headlong into battle!|
92460|#823$#Ha-ha-ha! I knew you'd be good! Fine, fine! I'll go with you!|
92461|Summer Alucard's tips to not melt under the sun.|
92462|#822$#It's hot in here! Be careful with the UV rays!
#821$#Do you really think I'd care for such trivial dilemmas? I've seen so many bad endings.|
92463|#821$#A hat? For me? Well, I truly hope you'll follow my advice.|
92464|Summer Alucard's Slackness|
92465|#2$#The sun goes down in Helonia Coast and the last golden rays of light are reflected on the waves.
#501$#I just want to chill on my boat at the mercy of the tide.|
92466|#822$#These cool vibes are incredible. Ice Crystal Plant Extract.
#821$#Oh! Time has passed by but you're still such a child.|
92467|Summer Alucard's Inspiration I|
92468|#822$#Have you ever seen what happens when you use the Ice Crystal Plant Extract with two special items?
#821$#It's amazing. Unparalleled power. You have to see it.|
92469|#821$#Nice job, I'll just adjust it a bit before I use it.|
92470|Summer Alucard's Inspiration II|
92471|#821$#I need to find two different rare items to check if it works.
#822$#Would you mind looking for a Ice Field Frost Turtle shell and the Miracle Thornapple?|
92472|#821$#The shell powder looks like snowflakes.
#821$#Just a little bit more of juice and voila!
#821$#What's the purpose of this machine? It is a shaved ice machine!|
92473|Summer Alucard's tips to stay cool as a cucumber|
92474|#822$#Do you want to try it? It's so hot in here!
#821$#I am looking for human ingredients to prepare the perfect drink for you!|
92475|#821$#Wow, you picked them up so fast! I barely have time to see what you're doing.
#823$#This is a special Grape Iced Tea. What do you think of the color? Groovy, right?|
92476|Summer Alucard's Ring of Memories|
92477|#821$#Human life compared to mine is only a drop in the sea.
#822$#I do not know if I'll be able to remember this summer or not.|
92478|#821$#This little thingy can help people remember precious memories, specially when they have such long lives like mine.
#822$#I shouldn't forget what's important. I should always treasure them in my mind.
#821$#I promise you I'll respect this agreement forever and ever.|
92479|Summer Nidhogg's Midsummer Night's Dream|
92480|#821$#Oh, you wouldn't believe what a dreadful nightmare I just had!
#824$#There were squirrels and eagles everywhere!|
92481|#821$#Well, I guess you are "really" talented. This is a disgraceful snack.
#822$#If it weren't yours, I wouldn't eat it at all!|
92482|Summer Nidhogg's Seashell Wind Chime I|
92483|#821$#After a good session of thinking,
#824$#I can barely sleep. It must be all those stupid eagles.
#822$#I think I need a sweet sound to sooth me when I sleep so I can forget about them.|
92484|#821$#Oh, look! A seashell!
#822$#Is this the inferior food meant to honor me?
#821$#So you say I can use it to create a wind chime?|
92485|Summer Nidhogg's Seashell Wind Chime II|
92486|#821$#You ended up being a creative mortal, who would have thought?
#822$#Still, these broken shells are not enough to craft a wind chime.
#823$#Hmm, we can use these threads.|
92487|#821$#Yes, they work fine!
#823$#I don't think these threads match my personality.|
92488|Summer Nidhogg's Fireworks I|
92489|#823$#Fireworks remind me of my enemies, they burn so fast!
#821$#I'm thinking about crafting my own fireworks, they will make yours look like a bang snap!|
92490|#821$#Lights beads remind me of the son of light, it is really uncomfortable...
#823$#But with my talent, I can make world-class fireworks. Hahaha!|
92491|Summer Nidhogg's Fireworks Burst II|
92492|#821$#Hey? What do you mean fireworks are just mean to see them?
#822$#That's probably what dumb people do, isn't it?.
#821$#It seems like I can learn one thing or two about destruction from fireworks.|
92493|#823$#We can bring together my planning and your materials to have the perfect weapon!|
92494|Summer Nidhogg's Eternal Summer|
92495|#821$#All cowards and renegades will be eaten by fear.
#822$#I will only pick the strongest and fittest ones. You have to keep up with me!|
92496|#821$#Your progress is so slow that it can barely be named "progress".
#823$#Witness the day when the world was ruined by me!|
92497|Tsukuyomi's Dark Night (Part 1)|
92498|#821$#...... Hmm? Oh, I was just reminiscing about the Land of Midnight Snacks a little...
#823$#It's always nighttime there, so you never miss a chance to gaze up at the stars.
#821$#Visit only once, and you'll definitely miss it as much as I do.|
92499|#821$#... Why? Who made the sky dark?
#823$#Oh. Well, I did. I'm pretty considerate, huh?|
92500|Tsukuyomi's Dark Night (Part 2)|
92501|#823$#Do you know? There's only one thing in the night sky that surpasses the stars' grace.
#821$#Um... You're clever enough to guess what it is.|
92502|#823$#The full moon does sort of resemble a diamond, you're right.
#821$#So, you understand after all. Only when night falls can the world's beauty truly be appreciated.|
92503|Tsukuyomi's Short Sword Care|
92504|#821$#Hmm... I just realized my blade could do with a bit of servicing.
#822$#See? Look closer, near the hilt.
#821$#Hmm, now how should I go about this...? It's certainly fixable.|
92505|#823$#Oh, wow! Just look at these tools.
#821$#These'll have my short sword looking good as new in no time.|
92506|Tsukuyomi's Daily Diet|
92507|#824$#I'm feeling a little hungry. But practically everything has meat in it.
#821$#Um... Would you happen to know where I can find some delicious veggie dishes?|
92508|#823$#Oh, these salads look delicious! So lush...
#821$#I'll admit you've got good taste.|
92509|Tsukuyomi's New Threads|
92510|#822$#...... All that fighting has left my clothes looking like the battlefield.
#821$#I can't be seen out and about in this! But what to do...?|
92511|#823$#Oh...um... This ornament, it sparkles just like a star...
#821$#Is it really okay to accept this? You're not just trying to butter me up, are you?
#823$#Hee hee. I know, I know. I really appreciate the gift.|
92512|Midnight Snack Attack|
92513|#821$#Um... I may be adept at governing the Land of Midnight Snacks, but you remain a mystery to me.
#823$#Your heart... Does it understand mine?|
92514|#823$#I think I already know the answer. I'll treasure this bond well.
#822$#Let's continue to grow stronger together, all right?|
92515|Ullr's Hunting Tour|
92516|#821$#In Ydalir, I'm adept with a bow not only when hunting on land but in water too.
#822$#I recall one unexpectedly strong white fish that put up quite the fight...|
92517|#822$#This is that very fish. He must have been hiding in the lake under the ice.
#823$#Allow me to honor its fighting spirit by serving it to you tonight.|
92518|Ullr's Precious Collection|
92519|#821$#I once possessed a precious treause but no longer.
#822$#Would you help me find it? I believe this is something only you can do.|
92520|#821$#It is beautiful, true, but your worth is far greater.|
92521|Ullr's Archery Know-How (Part 1)|
92522|#821$#Hey... Do you wish to learn how to make bows and arrows?
#822$#In a play like Ydalir's with eternal winter, this sort of thing isn't some mere hobby. Do you already know what you'll need?|
92523|#822$#Perseverance is what'll keep you alive out there in such rough conditions.
#823$#So, you already realize that, do you? Then you've already mastered the first step.|
92524|Ullr's Archery Know-How (Part 2)|
92525|#821$#Um... You can't make archery materials out of just anything.
#822$#But no yew trees grow in Ydalir. What else can be used, then?|
92526|#821$#Hmm, yes, this sort of wood is good quality. I see you've got an eye for this sort of thing.
#823$#Once the bow and arrows are finished, let's go hunting together.|
92527|Ullr's Snowy Picnic|
92528|#821$#Ever since meeting you I've felt this sudden yearning to have a picnic in the snow.
#822$#Um... But what sort of food is best in cold weather?|
92529|#823$#This is...delicious. Somehow, you always seem to know exactly what I want even before I do.|
92530|Ullr's Heart's Desire|
92531|#821$#I can't help but think that you're...irreplaceable to me. Am I the same to you?|
92532|#822$#Let me take the vanguard and keep you safe.
#821$#Never leave my side.|
92533|Halloween Zashi's Trick (Part 1)|
92534|#822$#Trick or Treat!
#823$#Give me something good to eat!|
92535|#825$#Huh? What's this? It sure doesn't look like candy... But it's still sweet and delicious! Mhmm!|
92536|Halloween Zashi's Trick (Part 2)|
92537|#825$#It's not that I don't like cookies, but candy is king!
#824$#H-hey, what're you doing! I didn't say I didn't want it!|
92538|#824$#Oh, this isn't candy either... Aren't I the one who's supposed to do the tricking here?
#825$#Oh well, a little taste won't hurt... All right. Mhmm! This tastes good too... Eep! It's starting to melt!
#821$#Haah... Now that my belly is full, I think it's time for a nap.|
92539|Halloween Zashi's Jack O'Lantern (Part 1)|
92540|#823$#Master! Shall we carve jack-o'-lanterns with the others?
#822$#Let's find a really big pumpkin, okay?|
92541|#822$#Ours will be the best one yet!
#823$#Hey! It's done! Hee hee hee! Its face looks so silly! We ended up making the best one after all.|
92542|Halloween Zashi's Jack O'Lantern (Part 2)|
92543|#824$#Huh? Master... Why'd these pumpkin lights go out?
#821$#Could it be Mr. Jack O'Lantern fell asleep? Hee hee|
92544|#823$#Oh, there we go! What a lovely sight.
#822$#This would make a terrific nightlight, huh?
#821$#Hm... Good night, Master! Sweet dreams!|
92545|Halloween Zashi's Halloween Party|
92546|#822$#Everyone's talking about the big party being held on Halloween night.
#823$#I'm the Young Hex now. As long as there's something...
#822$#I can invite a lot of friends to go|
92547|#822$#to the Young Hex's Magic Variation.
#823$#Hey, it's really moving! Wow, so many friends!|
92548|Halloween Zashi's Reverie|
92549|#823$#Don't you just love Halloween, Master?
#822$#I can't remember ever having so much fun.
#823$#Are you as happy as I am right now?|
92550|#823$#Hanging out with you is the best.
#821$#Hahhh... Looks like everyone's getting tired... I'm feeling sleepy too... Sweet dreams, Master.|
92551|Sakuya-hime's Nourishment|
92552|#821$#Hmm... Lately, Floret discovered that...
#824$#There are no flowers everywhere... This can't go on...!
#823$#Come help Floret make the flowers bloom all over... The seeds have been planted, and...|
92553|#823$#Wow... I bet everyone will love this...
#821$#Hee... Everyone's drinking up... Grow well everyone...|
92554|Sakuya-hime's Blossom|
92555|#823$#Teehee... The flowers we planted previously have all blossomed beautifully...
#821$#Mmm... Everyone smells good and sweet too...|
92556|#821$#Huh? Why have the petals started to fall...
#821$#Sister said that although flowers are beautiful, they never last long...|
92557|Sakuya-hime's Flower Tales|
92558|#823$#Floret likes flowers most... especially cherry blossoms!
#821$#Floret wants to test you! Do you know the Flower Tales of cherry blossom...?|
92559|#823$#Wow... You got it! It's "Forever living"...!
#821$#Hee... Floret knew you'd get it...!|
92560|Sakuya-hime's Flower Viewing 1|
92561|#823$#Let's go! Let's go look at the flowers together...
#821$#Huh? There are no flowers if it's not blooming season?
#823$#Floret has an idea! Just help Floret to get something first...|
92562|#821$#Teehee... As long as Floret blesses this flower dust and scatters them with the power of the wind...
#823$#The branches touched by the dust will be covered with beautiful flowers...!|
92563|Sakuya-hime's Flower Viewing 2|
92564|#821$#Teehee... These flowers are so beautiful...
#823$#Floret likes to sit on high branches and enjoy the flowers...
#821$#Huh? Snacks to go with the flower viewing? Floret wants to eat...|
92565|#821$#Wow... Is this food made from flowers...?!
#823$#This is the first time Floret is seeing something like this! Floret wants to eat these while viewing the flowers again...|
92566|Sakuya-hime's Blossoming Season|
92567|#821$#Everyone says that Floret is the embodiment of flowers, but although flowers are beautiful, they wither easily too...
#821$#Are you willing to be the soil that supports Floret...?|
92568|#821$#Teehee... Floret knows your decision...
#823$#Let's fill the world with beautiful flowers...!|
92569|Santa Lumikki's Present Preparation|

92593|Santa Alice's Christmas Tea Party I|
92594|#821$#This is the first time I've hosted a tea party in the winter.
#823$#Maybe I should invite Hansel and Gretel...
#821$#I wonder if Hansel would catch a cold...|
92595|#821$#Are these clothes for our guests?
#823$#That's great! I'll go invite Hansel!
#822$#Haha! I almost forgot about Gretel...|

92611|Andrea's Frozen Dinner|
92612|#821$#I'm quite thirsty now, go find me something to drink.
#821$#Can I consume anything from this world?|

92614|Andrea's Peasant Experience|
92615|#821$#You want me to go fishing like a peasant?

#823$#I'll be waiting here, make sure you catch enough.|
92617|Andrea's Ice Magic|
92618|#821$#Whenever I use my incredible powers to control ice, people fear me.

#823$#Would you like to ride with me?|
92620|Andrea's Loneliness|
92621|#821$#Even after all this time together, I still don't believe in eternal bonds.

#823$#It seems I'll have to get used to having someone around me.|
92623|Iwanaga-hime's Umbrella Maintenance|
92624|#821$#Lately, I have used my Umbrella Sakura too often...
#822$#Maybe I should go and check it out...
#824$#But... Going out is too scary...|
92625|#822$#Is this... is this for me?
#823$#Thank you, master...|
92626|Iwanaga-hime's Umbrella Decoration|
92627|#823$#Little Flower says that beautiful things make people happy.
#821$#Why don't you decorate my umbrella?
#822$#It will look better...|

92635|Iwanaga-hime's Battle II|
92636|#822$#Master, you've done so much for me...
#821$#I will be more positive!
#822$#But... On the street? It is a little bit scary...|
92637|#821$#Is this... Is this what I'm supposed to wear?
#822$#I will let you know if I want to wear it.
#823$#I feel braver.|
92638|Iwanaga-hime's Eternal Promise|
92639|#821$#I... I... *sniff*... I can grant people eternal life...
#822$#It is just that... Living forever can be very lonely...
#822$#Master, I'm willing to fight on your side... What do you say?|
92640|#821$#You've always been by my side, encouraging me...
#822$#I will always be thankful!
#823$#Please allow me to continue helping you!|
92641|Urd's Interests|
92642|#822$#I love searching for ancient relics.
#821$#I just found an ancient box in the ruins!
#822$#Wonder how we can open it...|
92643|#822$#Huh? A flat drill?!
#822$#Be careful! Don't break it!|
92644|Urd's Interests II|
92645|#822$#*Cough* All I see in this box is dust...
#822$#There should be something besides dust in here.|
92646|#822$#This stone tablet... it seems to illustrate ancient legends.
#823$#I need to take the stone tablet back and read it carefully...
#821$#This ancient relic trip was a great success!|
92647|A Study of Urd's Time|
92648|#822$#Do you know that the past is not only the passage of time...
#822$#What else do you mean?|
92649|#821$#Ha! Your understanding is the same as mine.
#822$#The past is not the disappearance of time, it's the accumulation of time.|
92650|Urd's Rest|
92651|#822$#I've been reading history books for three days. I feel a bit tired...
#822$#Hmm... I should really get some rest...|
92652|#822$#These... are they all for me?
#823$#Thanks so much for your help! You're so kind!|
92653|Urd the Author|
92654|#822$#The world's past is recorded in the Chamber of Time.
#823$#But writing things down on paper is not bad either.
#822$#Hmm... but where are all my writing tools?|
92655|#822$#Great! Did you find these for me?
#823$#Now I can write the story of how we met!|
92656|Urd's Past|
92657|#822$#The passage of time has become history... memories that can never be reclaimed...
#822$#As time passes... will you forget me too one day?|
92658|#822$#Will you remember me as a face from the past?
#823$#I'll remember your face forever... it will be an indelible memory.|
92659|Skuld's Purchase|
92660|#821$#Haha! I've got a lot of ingredients to buy today.
#824$#Hmm? Hmm? Is something really missing? How could I forget it?|
92661|#821$#That's right. These are the ones. Did I just drop it...??
#823$#Thanks so much for your help! If it weren't for you, I'd have to do it all again!|
92662|Skuld's Time|
92663|#821$#Ah! This electromagnetic device is difficult to handle!
#824$#How could I have designed such a complicated contraption? My head hurts!|
92664|#821$#Is this for me? I'm so thirsty...
#823$#Ahem... Are you worried about me? Don't worry, I'll rest well!|
92665|Epic Skuld I|
92666|#821$#Ahem... This invention will be the largest mecha device in history!
#822$#That's why I need your help! Please bring me some tools!|
92667|#821$#Thank you! You're fast!
#823$#Looks like it'll be done sooner than we expected!|
92668|Epic Skuld II|
92669|#821$#The device is almost complete! There's just a last bit of energy to fill...
#822$#Can you help me find it? I'll prepare for the finale.|
92670|#821$#Right! That's it! Let's put them in.
#823$#Hmm? What is this device? Hmph! It's a Terracottage!
#822$#Simply place this device on the house and it'll take you wherever you want to go.|
92671|Skuld's Sneaky Plan|
92672|#821$#Well... What can I do to escape...??
#822$#Ah! You're just in time! Help me think of something!
#821$#How can I keep my sister from learning I sneak out?|
92673|#823$#You're so smart! No one will spot you from afar!
#821$#Taking care of the World Tree is exhausting. Let me rest a bit...|
92674|Skuld's Future|
92675|#821$#Are you also curious about the future?
#822$#I'm in charge of the future, so I can tell you what's to come.|
92676|#821$#Hmph! Is this some sort of bribe?
#822$#I'll take this, but I won't tell you the future just yet...
#823$#I'll tell you after you've hung out with me a bit more.|
92677|Kingyo-hime's Delicious Snack|
92678|#821$#Since I've been traveling..., I haven't had any little shrimp...
#824$#Umm... I'm thinking about everyone in the river...|
92679|#821$#Umm! I've got you! You heard my words...
#822$#Although I miss my friends in the river,
#822$#you're also my friend!
#823$#Next time! Let's go catch them together!|
92680|Kingyo-hime's Fan Care|
92681|#821$#Iwanaga-hime seems to take care of her umbrella often...
#824$#Umm... Should I take care of my fan, too?|
92682|#821$#What a magical material! Perfect for me!
#823$#You're amazing! You always know what I have in mind!|
92683|Kingyo-hime's Play Program|
92684|#821$#Ruby, what do you say? Maybe we should go and play in the river under this weather?
#822$#But I always need to prepare a lot of things to play with...
#824$#It's so annoying thinking about it!|
92685|#821$#Umm! How sweet!
#823$#You and Ruby are very kind to me! I'm so happy!|
92686|Kingyo-hime's Play Program II|
92687|#821$#Umm... No, no, no! Only with these things,
#822$#we can't go somewhere deeper...|
92688|#821$#Right!
#821$#They are exactly what we need! No we can go!
#823$#I like you the most! Only second to Ruby though!|
92689|Kingyo-hime's Gift|
92690|#821$#Sisters always say that one needs to bring gifts back when traveling.
#822$#Umm... Do you think we should also bring some gifts back?|
92691|#823$#You're amazing! Just like Ruby!
#821$#I feel like there's nothing I can't do with you by my side!|
92692|Kingyo-hime's Dazzling Bubbles|
92693|#821$#Sister Yukime once said... Happiness is like bubbles...
#822$#The happier you are, the faster the bubbles break up... But we aren't like that, are we?
#822$#You'll be always by my side, right?|
92694|#821$#I didn't know bubbles won't break up once frozen!
#821$#I... I... *sniff*... I'll be like this ice crystal!
#823$#Protect you! All the time!|
92695|Persephone's Mischief|
92696|#821$#Terra is so much fun!
#824$#I want to see more interesting things!|
92697|#824$#Wow! Beautiful!
#822$#Where did you find it?
#822$#Next time, take me with you!|
92698|Persephone's Collection I|
92699|#821$#There are so many beautiful and fun things...
#824$#I want to collect them all!|
92700|#821$#Smells good! I love the fragrance!
#823$#You're pretty good! Maybe we'll get along well!|
92701|Persephone's Collection II|
92702|#821$#What else? What else?
#821$#You're my master, aren't you?
#824$#Show me what's going on!|
92703|#821$#I can't believe such a thing exists in Terra...
#823$#Hmm? A Wisp... How come you're just like that idiot!
#823$#But... I feel closer to you!|
92704|Persephone's Pride|
92705|#821$#...No way! Leave Pandemonium!
#822$#I need to... arm myself...
#821$#Maybe then I won't be so lonely...|
92706|#821$#What...
#821$#So you do know...
#823$#However, I don't hate your self-assertion! Thank you...|
92707|Persephone's Memory|
92708|#821$#How come it feels like... I can't raise my spirits...
#822$#Am I sick? I feel like everything...|
92709|#823$#Yes! Eat and you'll have strength!
#821$#You! Let's eat together!
#823$#I want to share it with you! All of it!|
92710|Persephone's Decision|
92711|#821$#You're alive, and so is Terra.
#821$#I've acquired some different pleasures here...
#822$#And you?|
92712|#821$#Hot... It's heat that even I can feel...
#821$#No one can ignore such vitality.
#823$#I will never leave you while the temperature is at this level!|
92713|Alina's Mischief|
92714|#823$#I just had a sudden craving for fish!
#821$It'd be even better if it were a sticky and slippery fish.|
92715|#822$#That's what I want. Well done!
#821$#Put this on the back of the Amaterasu, and it'll scare her!
#823$#If you cook it properly, it'll be worth your while.|
92716|Alina's Plan I|
92717|#823$#I want that one!
#823$#A little oval one that can hatch adorable little things.
#822$#It's the one you're thinking about right now. Take it out and give it to me!|
92718|#822$#Wow! This is it!
#821$#Hmph...With this, I can...|
92719|Alina's Plan II|
92720|#823$#I am such a great God!
#821$#The cutie from last time has been hatched!
#822$#We need some more tools to complete my great plan...|
92721|#821$#I'll build a little house like this!
#821$#You're called Little Jade II from today on!
#822$#And then you're Little Jade III!
#823$#You don't like it? I can't help you!|
92722|Alina's Little Ceremony|
92723|#821$#Yeah! Let's hold a ceremony! Let's have some food! Let's hold a ceremony!
#822$#What? Do you want to participate in our ceremony? Then bring the offerings.|
92724|#822$#What did you say? Why is nobody here?
#822$#Because it's a my own ceremony...
#823$#But since you brought the offerings...
#821$#Let's celebrate the two of us together!|
92725|Important Work of Alina|
92726|#823$#I'm so busy, I need this tool. I need that too...
#822$#You look like you're bored, come help!
#824$#I... I am not preparing for a prank. This is a very important job!|
92727|#822$#Hmph, this is pretty powerful, isn't it? Although it's a bit rough...
#823$#With this item, the farmers will be able to farm easier!
#821$#That way, we can spend more time playing together.|
92728|A Prosperous Blessing from Alina|
92729|#821$#We've been together for a while...
#822$#You should know what I want without me saying, right?|
92730|#823$#Here you go. This flower crown is blessed by me and will bring prosperous blessings to the people.
#822$#It's very similar to the stuff you've prepared for us. So our hearts are connected!
#821$#We'll always be happy together as we are today.|

92749|Otohime's Shopping Preparations|
92750|#823$#I want to go shopping...
#821$#But if I go to the street empty-handed... I can only look at others...|
92751|#822$#Huh? Master found me!
#821$#Heehee! I know that in Terra one cannot buy with shells...
#823$#But if I don't prepare some, I will get nervous...|
92752|Otohime's Shopping Crisis|
92753|#823$#Aaaaaaah!

#821$#This is a secret!|
92761|Otohime's Kindness 2|
92762|#823$#I'm a bit late...

#824$#What should I do?|
92763|#822$#Huh? Master, are you here to help?
#823$#This is for you, Master!
#821$#Because... Thank you so much, Master!
#821$#You're the best in the world!|
92764|Otohime's Secret Hope|
92765|#821$#Hmm... Last time I made a big meal for Master...
#822$#I wonder if Master feels the same way...|
92766|#823$#So...
#822$#I knew Master would be thrilled!
#821$#Let's keep holding hands like always! Take this ring as a proof of my love!|

#821$#But... Just for your safety, I will go with you!|
96296|#821$#From my point of view, lives are just like fireworks...
#822$#Short and sweet! Just like Kabuto! And you, I guess.|
96297|#824$#Alright, I'll let you decide the location.
#821$#But... You should know I prefer battlefields.
#823$#Fireworks of blood... Hahaha!|
96298|#824$#They're just like the blooming Heavenly Lilies!
#823$#... Burp... Is that an invitation?|
96299|What's your favorite food?|
96300|What do you normally eat?|
96301|#824$#Food that goes well with grape juice.
#821$#What? So... Are you going to make me some antipasto?|
96302|#823$#Whatever, just make sure it goes well with grape juice.|
96303|#824$#Lately I've had a craving for milk.
#821$#Why? Hm... Well, I want to grow.
#824$#Do... Do I have to say it out loud!?|
96304|#824$#Kabuto loves sweets.
#822$#Oh yeah, Kabuto really knows how to eat! You really shouldn't starve him...|
96305|What do you do when you're in a bad mood?|
96306|What cheers you up?|
96307|#824$#So, you do care about me. I'll be sure to remember that next time I'm sad.
#823$#I'll be gentle, I promise. *Wink* Ha! Just kidding!|
96308|#824$#When I am sad... Well, I drink grape juice obviously! Just one glass makes all the difference!|
96309|#822$#Only Kabuto can hear me... Even after all this time...
#823$#If you have the time... Can you talk to me more?|
96310|#824$#When I am depressed, I really need to have some fun with Murasame. I always feel better after that!
#823$#Oh? You heard me? Ha!|
96311|Something I like?|
96312|Which do you like more?|
96313|#821$#A Tachi is as much a part of a samurai as one of its arms!
#822$#And Kabuto of course... Kabuto is my friend...|
96314|#824$#Of course it's grape juice! Can you imagine a life without it?|
96315|#824$#A toast represents trust between two people.
#821$#If it's with you... Well, I'll give it a shot!|
96316|#824$#My favourite thing? Hehehe...

96319|#821$#I don't really choose my battles, but...
#822$#If anyone hurts my Kabuto or you... I will kill them!|
96320|#824$#Practice makes perfect you know!
#821$#I guess you agree with me, no?|
96321|#824$#Battle? Bah, that's easy. Just like drinking grape juice!|
96322|#822$#No matter how harsh the battle is...
#821$#I will be your sharpest blade!|
96323|Have you participated in the Tanuki Turmoil?|
96324|Have you been on a battlefield before?|
96325|#821$#Are you going to a battlefield?
#823$#Don't you worry. Kabuto and I will be by your side!|
96326|#821$#My old life... All I remember is the battlefields...|
96327|#821$#Tanuki Turmoil is a 5 on 5 battlefield.
#823$#You would have to fight for corn with the Tanukis!|
96328|#821$#Don't underestimate them just because they're cute!
#822$#Cute enemies are the worst!|
96329|Do you know of the Book of Destiny?|
96330|What can you tell me about the Vault of Eternity?|
96331|#825$#Hmm... I... I'm not much of a reader...|
96332|#821$#The Vault of Eternity? It's the library built by Eternia...
#822$#A lot of famous people are there.|
96333|#821$#And it seems to be related to time and space somehow...
#823$#Let's go and check it out!|
96334|#821$#There is even a hall of fame in there!
#823$#That's the place to be!|
96335|Have you been to Port Skandia?|
96336|Have you heard about Port Skandia?|
96337|#821$#Oh? That's your hometown, right?
#823$#What's it like?|
96338|#821$#... A port? So, boats and fish huh...
#821$#Were you a fisherman by any chance?|
96339|#821$#Oh...um... Never heard of it...
#823$#Can you tell me more about it?|
96340|#823$#Oh, it's your hometown? Then... I have to protect it too!|
96341|Can you tell me about the Pet System?|
96342|Is Kabuto your pet?|
96343|#823$#A Pet... that's just a small creature that runs around with you right?
#821$#They seem to have some amazing skills!
#822$#Kabuto may look like it, but no...|
96344|#821$#Kabuto is not a pet. Rather, Kabuto is my spirit guardian!|
96345|#824$#Go to Sanctuary if you want a pet.
#821$#What? You want Kabuto as a pet? Didn't I tell you Kabuto is not a pet?|
96346|#823$#I've heard that someone in Sanctuary can make pets golden.
#822$#Kabuto would look amazing if he was all gold and shiny!|
96347|What's Weapon Mastery?|
96348|How should I choose a Weapon Mastery?|
96349|#824$#... It means "practice makes perfect".
#821$#The more you use a weapon, the more skilled in it you will become.
#824$#Don't you get it?|
96350|#824$#... What? You still haven't decided which path to take?
#821$#I don't like this indecisive attitude.|
96351|#824$#What's there to think... Just pick one!
#821$#If it turns out not to your liking, you can switch 10 minutes later!
#824$#The battlefield is no place for indecision!|
96352|#821$#Weapon Mastery? I don't know if I can explain it all that well...
#823$#Let's try it out! It's easier to understand if you see it in practice.
#822$#Are you ready? Let's go! Kabuto!|
96353|Do you like flowers?|
96354|What is your favorite kind?|
96355|#823$#Have you heard of the Aura Kingdom Lily? It's is a symbol of sad memories...
#825$#... Just like my past I guess...|
96356|#823$#There's a red flower I like, it's called... Hm... I forgot...|
96357|#821$#Every flower has a sad story behind it...|
96358|#825$#I... I don't hate flowers, but some of them... bring back sad memories...|
96359|Your clothes are very unique.|
96360|They look very good on you!|
96361|#821$#Oh, you like them? More the reason for me to keep them!|
96362|#822$#Oh? Really? Kabuto says they're too revealing...|
96363|#824$#... Why are you staring at my clothes?
#821$#It makes me feel uncomfortable... Do you have a fetish?
#824$#Burp... Hm... That's gross.|
96364|#824$#The perfect time to attack is when the enemy is focused on your clothes.|
96365|Where do you come from?|
96366|Can you tell me about your hometown?|
96367|#821$#My hometown... It's near a volcano that is higher than the sky...
#823$#There are a lot of hot springs there!|
96368|#821$#The place owns my soul... That's where my hometown is.|
96369|#823$#So, do you miss your home like me?|
96370|#821$#My home? Well, home is where your heart is!|
96371|Are you cursed?|
96372|I have heard that you are cursed...|
96373|#821$#Me? Maybe the ones who have died under my Tachi... Yeah, them.
#825$#... My Tachi is a curse to them.|
96374|#825$#... Are you afraid of my curse as well?|
96375|#824$#If you come too close, maybe the curse will befall you as well!
#821$#This is something you need to be aware of!|
96376|#821$#Bu in the end, the curse will only befall the weak ones...
#823$#So, you should be fine.|
96377|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
96378|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
96379|#823$#I haven't taken Kabuto to see Zephyrine for awhile.
#822$#They are very good friends you know.|
96380|#821$#I've heard that Justicia is good at making weapons...
#822$#Should I ask for help to fix Murasame?|
96381|#821$#Alucard spans three different realms...
#822$#All because of a promise, to protect someone from destiny...
#823$#I wonder if would I be able to do the same.|
96382|#821$#Kabuto doesn't like to see Yumikaze...
#822$#You see, Ruffles pecks Kabuto's head every single time.|
96383|So, that's a demon blade?|
96384|Everyone seems to be afraid of you|
96385|#825$#Master... That epithet... It reminds me of a past I would rather not remember...|
96386|#821$#The old me... Had a terrible thirst for blood...
#825$#In fact, I can still smell it.|
96387|#824$#... I used to be a cold-blooded killer, nothing but a tool really...
#825$#You cannot fathom the pain caused by abandonment and hatred...|
96388|#824$#Those days were very rough days...
#821$#Of course I remember them!|
96389|Have you heard about Amaterasu and Kusanagi?|
96390|Do you know Kusanagi?|
96391|#824$#Kusanagi... Is that the Tachi that broke off from a big snake?
#821$#Well, even if it is a super weapon, I will not be defeated!|
96392|#824$#... Burp... Is that Amaterasu and her Tachi?
#821$#They sound like a powerful combination! But they can't possibly beat me and Kabuto!|
96393|#824$#Why are you asking this? Do you want Kusanagi to serve you?
#821$#... Are you looking down on me and Kabuto? Well then... Let's do a little experiment, shall we?
#824$#I am going to slash a little less strongly...|
96394|#821$#Tachi... Kusanagi... Will my Murasame defeat her?|
96395|Tell me about your weapon.|
96396|What is your weapon?|
96397|#821$#The inscription on this Tachi says "Murasame".
#823$#I've had it for as long as I can remember.|
96398|#821$#The spirit inside is extremely strong, and I think it's becoming real somehow...
#822$#It can condense the air and make it rain with the slightest of movements.
#821$#Hence the name I guess...|
96399|#822$#Its purpose is to destroy all obstacles in its wielder's way.
#821$#If anything is in your way, I will get rid of it for you!|
96400|#821$#This blade is indeed a masterpiece! The inscription on it says "Murasame".
#822$#Oh? Do you want one too? Um... I can't give Murasame to you!|
96401|Who is this sprite?|
96402|Who is Kabuto?|
96403|#821$#Kabuto is my spirit guardian.
#822$#I think he was a famous samurai in a past life!|
96404|#821$#Are you talking about Kabuto?
#822$#Kabuto is my spirit guardian, not a ghost.|
96405|#824$#Are you interested in Kabuto? You... You wouldn't do anything to Kabuto, right?
#821$#If you bully Kabuto, I will smash your face in!|
96406|#821$#... Do you really care about Kabuto?
#823$#Kabuto also respects you, almost as much as I do...|
96407|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
96408|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
96409|#825$#... Are you dying or something?
#821$#Don't worry, I will always remember you.|
96410|#821$#If... If this is your decision, then... I will abide by it...
#825$#But... Please remember me!|
96411|#824$#... Burp... Is someone chasing you? Ha! Then they would have to get past me!
#822$#If you're dead, I'll be very, very sad. Right Kabuto?|
96412|#824$#Burp... Ha...  If you keep asking that kind of question, I'm going to kill someone!|

96466|#821$#An elegant lady such as myself has many suitors!
#823$#You'd have to work harder to be my Guardian Knight!|
96467|Can you tell me about the housing system?|
96468|What is the housing system?|
96469|#821$#A house? Are you inviting me to your place?
#824$#I won't go if it's not posh enough!|
96470|#821$#Decoration is the evening wear of a house. The right decorations can make a palace out of a shack!|
96471|#823$#A house? My house is huge!
#821$#There's a large silver gate that looks upon the front garden, leading to a majestic castle.
#823$#There's a beautiful crystal chandelier in the large hall. Also a leather sofa and a classic fireplace...
#821$#Huh? It's similar to your place?! Looks like you have good taste.|
96472|#821$#Baroque chandeliers, royal tapestry, classic sofas, and...
#823$#What am I doing? I'm planning the decorations for your house!
#824$#You can't be a sewer dweller if you're with me!|
96473|A pigeon?|
96474|A pigeon in a suit?|
96475|#822$#Buzz? He's my Housekeeper.
#821$#He cooks, manages the household, prepares lessons...
#822$#Nothing is too much for him!|
96476|#821$#Buzz has been with me since I was young.
#822$#Buzz is in charge of everything in my life!
#821$#but he's a bit long-winded.|
96477|#823$#Buzz's outfit is great, right? I chose it myself.
#821$#Everyone around me has to look stylish!|
96478|#821$#Buzz is the most important person to me.
#822$#Buzz takes care of anything and everything.
#821$#What's more important, Buzz or love? Love, of course!|
96479|Have you ever been in love?|
96480|Views on Love|
96481|#821$#I'm presented with so many suitors!
#824$#But none are my true love,
#823$#I will know my true love by how alike we are.|
96482|#821$#Love? Of course I've been in love! In... my dreams!|
96483|#821$#If you like someone you have to be assertive! Love won't just come knocking on your door.
#824$#Take it from me, if you like someone you have to grab them!
#821$#I haven't found my true love yet, but I will!|
96484|#824$#Do you know there are forced relationships? Ummm, arranged marriages?
#821$#It takes freedom to find true love!
#824$#I will never accept arranged romance!|
96485|Beautiful Outfit|
96486|Elegant Style|
96487|#823$#My clothes are all designed by top designers.
#824$#What, you've not heard of him?! He's from the top design school!
#821$#Looks like I'll have to show you around more often.|
96488|#821$#Why are you suddenly praising me?
#822$#Do you have some requests?|
96489|#823$#I want to be an elegant socialite!
#821$#The main thing it takes to be a socialite is exquisite taste.|
96490|#823$#You have a good eye. This outfit was specially made for me.
#821$#It's made of silver lace. Tthe pink ribbon is sewn with golden thread...
#824$#...Hey, I'm talking here, why are you dozing off!|
96491|Tell me about your weapon.|
96492|What is your weapon?|
96493|#821$#I just have to pat this device on the waist and Cupid will appear!
#823$#Cupid will destroy any enemies at a distance.
#824$#Dirty enemies cannot come near me!|
96494|#821$#The gem on Cupid is a pink zircon gemstone!
#823$#Isn't it a pretty bow? Only the most gorgeous weapons are worthy of me!|
96495|#821$#Don't you think bows are the best weapons ever?
#823$#They can destroy enemies from afar. Such a perfect weapon for me!|
96496|#821$#My Cupid has love magic.
#823$#Anyone who receives an arrow from Cupid's bow will fall in love with the first person they see. Awesome right?
#824$#What? It's no joke! Let's see you try it out!|
96497|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
96498|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
96499|#821$#There's something between Serif, Merrilee and Endora...
#821$#My senses are telling me something is up!
#824$#What?! I'm not gossiping.|
96500|#821$#Yumikaze has to dress up nicely as a girl.
#822$#Buzz, why don't you dress up Yumikaze and Ruffles with me.
#824$#Their tastes are abysmal! One has to be prepared for love at any moment!|
96501|#821$#Looks like Lumikki is looking for her prince charming.
#824$#Could we be looking for the same person?!|
96502|#821$#Muse always hides her feelings, so she'll never find true love!
#824$#Hmph, she didn't tell me who it is!
#821$#If I find out who she likes, I'm going to tell them immediately.|
96503|There's composure lessons going on?|
96504|Composure is important?|
96505|#821$#My quest is to become an elegant socialite!
#822$#Elegant taste is first, but graceful composure is the second most important thing!|
96506|#821$#You've seen that!?
#824$#Let me tell you, I wasn't a diligent student!
#821$#I just trained randomly! Don't misunderstand!|
96507|#821$#The first impression you give is of grace and composure.
#824$#Your back is not straight enough! Point your chin down and suck in your stomach! Just like me!|
96508|#823$#Hehe, looks like you've understood the importance of composure.
#821$#Looks like you have the makings of a socialite too!|
96509|I heard that there's a love perfume...|
96510|What's the use of a love perfume?|
96511|#821$#Do you know about my love perfume?
#823$#Looks like my fame is spread throughout the lands, hehehe...|
96512|#821$#What, you want it? You sure have taste.
#824$#I crafted it with my sweat and blood! You can't have it just like that.
#823$#I might consider it if you make me happy, gahahahaha!
#822$#Oh, no! An elegant lady must not laugh like this! You didn't see that, did you?|
96513|#821$#This is my special-formula perfume!
#824$#What?! It's not a find-your-perfect-partner perfume! It works on anyone! It would make a fish fall in love with a flea!
#823$#Who's the target? Gahaha! People I don't like, of course!|
96514|#821$#Since you've been serving me the whole day, I'll lend it to you.
#824$#Take care not to drop it! Something bad happened when I dropped it before.
#823$#But when you have this much poise, it's easy to smooth things oveer...|
96515|Venus's Birth?|
96516|Scene at the birth?|
96517|#823$#My birth? It was glorious and majestic! Gahahaha!|
96518|#821$#Are you snooping into my privacy?
#824$#What are you even thinking about?|
96519|#823$#I was pampered at birth, of course!
#821$#What do you mean, arrogant and capricious? What's that?|
96520|#821$#Everyone's birth is the same, right?
#822$#A gentle breeze, splashing waves, and beautiful blooming flowers.
#821$#Your birth wasn't like this?!|
96521|Most memorable dream|
96522|About a dream|
96523|#821$#I'm still looking for my true love in my dreams.
#822$#Where's the love that's meant for me?|
96524|#821$#I'm a love mage in my dreams!
#823$#Gahaha, I've helped tons of people who have love troubles!
#824$#But in my own dreams I should be the one in love!|
96525|#821$#I dreamt of a beautiful princess... everyone loved her...
#824$#But really, how can there be someone who's more beautiful than me! It had to have been a dream!|
96526|#823$#You'd like to know, wouldn't you? Gahaha, I'll tell you then!
#821$#I always dream of a handsome lover beside a stream.
#824$#But... he was amazingly rude! He ignored me! What an attitude!
#821$#I was angry and....! What happened to him?|
96527|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
96528|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
96529|#824$#You have too much time on your hands, don't you? Looks like you'll blabber on and on unless you get some tasks!
#821$#You! Go out and buy this... and that! Hurry up!|
96530|#821$#Are you trying to leave?
#824$#Fine. Leave and go far away! I don't care!|
96531|#824$#What are you saying? You're not allowed to leave before I'm bored of you!|
96532|#821$#Don't think I will forgive you for saying such a thing...
#824$#Darn it, darn it! Pick on someone your own size!|
96533|What are your usual activities|
96534|What do you get up to in your free time?|
96535|#821$#Sometimes I would research topics on the physical aspects of humans...
#822$#You'd like to know the details?|
96536|#822$#If there's nothing that piques my interest...
#821$#I'd probably go out for a walk.
#822$#Just to listen to the beautiful laments of dead souls...|
96537|#822$#Usually I would research the organs and bone structures of different creatures.
#821$#Each organ's shape has its purpose, each bone has its reason for existing...
#822$#A day will just whizz past like this, haha.|
96538|#822$#I'm more curious about what YOU do during your spare time.|
96539|Fighting?|
96540|Are you a good fighter?|
96541|#822$#Ah, are you worried about me?
#821$#What an adorable child.|
96542|#822$#Do you question my skills?
#823$#Such nerve, do you want to test it yourself? Ho ho ho!|
96543|#822$#I'm not an expert, but I'm no novice as well.
#821$#You should be careful to stand out of the way of my attacks.
#822$#There's nothing stronger than the will of the dead.|
96544|#821$#Battle is easy for me.
#822$#Why do you think I'm able to collect so many fallen corpses? Haha...|
96545|Things that you hate|
96546|Are there things that you hate?|
96547|#821$#I hate cunning, rotten people.
#822$#Is it such a surprise?|
96548|#821$#What do I hate?
#822$#Well, if we're talking about non-physical things...
#822$#I guess it would be shallow love. Haha...|
96549|#822$#I don't like burning flames!
#821$#It's different from hellfire, I could actually get burnt.|
96550|#822$#Fake people make me sick.
#821$#Yet, it's hard to understand the hearts of people.
#822$#Only time can reveal everything.|
96551|Is there a special person in your life?|
96552|Types of people that you like?|
96553|#824$#I had happy days...once.
#822$#It's better to keep these happy memories hidden away.|
96554|#824$#There was someone I loved deeply.
#822$#But it's all in the past now.|
96555|#822$#I don't dislike someone like you.
#821$#Are you blushing? You're just too childish.|
96556|#822$#Mere appearances will not move me so easily...
#821$#Personality is the biggest deciding point in searching for a partner.|
96557|Favourite Food|
96558|What do you normally eat?|
96559|#822$#Fresh fruits are not bad!
#821$#Just the look of them makes me hungry.|
96560|#821$#I'd take my meals in Acheron...
#822$#Like human brains, eyeball maggots...Do you want some too?
#821$#Haha, look at your face! I don't eat that, of course.|
96561|#822$#I'd love to try delicious cuisine here.
#821$#Can you introduce me to some of your favourite dishes?|
96562|#822$#You don't think...
#821$#That I actually meant intestines and organs?|
96563|People the Magic Division|
96564|Have you heard of the Church Magic Division?|
96565|#821$#You mean humans who can use magic?
#822$#They're quite interesting, but...
#821$#I'm more interested in Envoys of Gaia like you.|
96566|#822$#Humans who can control the elements?
#821$#I wonder if they're able to control the flames of Acheron.|
96567|#822$#Humans who can control the elements?
#821$#Foul Stream is a natural element of Acheron!
#822$#Does that mean I'm a magician too? Ho ho ho!|
96568|#822$#Is that a place where Magic Knowledge is passed on?
#821$#Humans are strange, they dare tamper with such dangerous knowledge...
#822$#Aren't they afraid that magic will be abused?|
96569|Can you introduce some interesting spots?|
96570|Have you been to anywhere interesting?|
96571|#822$#Somewhere interesting?
#821$#Acheron, obviously. Have you been there before?|
96572|#822$#Tempest Desert is closest to the underworld.
#821$#I'd like to see it if possible.|
96573|#821$#I'm not familiar with your world.
#822$#Shouldn't you be the one introducing me to interesting places?
#821$#There's no need to go to hot climates.|
96574|#821$#I've seen the majestic waterfalls in the Tanglevine Cascades...
#822$#There are no giant waterfalls in Acheron.|
96575|About The Pandemonium|
96576|Do you know about the Pandemonium?|
96577|#822$#The underworld? I'm not sure...
#821$#It sounds like an interesting place, hehe.|
96578|#822$#I've heard of rumors of the Pandemonium.
#824$#The demons there are not especially bright...|
96579|#821$#Is it somewhere dangerous?
#822$#Such a coincidence, Acheron is deadly too.
#821$#But if I'm there, there's nothing to worry about.|
96580|#822$#I wonder how the organs of demons look.
#823$#We'll just have to dissect them and have a look!
#822$#Just kidding, don't take it seriously.|
96581|Do you like Card Duels?|
96582|Are you ready for a card duel?|
96583|#822$#They're not so popular in Acheron.
#821$#But I do know the rules...
#822$#You'll regret underestimating me.|
96584|#822$#Normal card games are boring,
#821$#should we place a wager? Bargaining chips...
#822$#How about our organs?|
96585|#822$#Are you trying to challenge me?
#823$#You'll regret it, haha.|
96586|#821$#Do you want to practise your skills with other people first?
#822$#I don't like to bully the weak, hehe.|
96587|Can you tell me about the housing system?|
96588|What is the housing system?|
96589|#822$#if you're interested in my abode,
#821$#the gates of Acheron are always open for you.|
96590|#822$#I'm not so well versed in this area.
#821$#Aren't you familiar with what I like?|
96591|#822$#Hmm, interior design?
#821$#I'd be happy to be your decoration consultant.|
96592|#821$#Do you need help with decoration style?
#822$#Do you want to try out an Acheron style decoration? Ho ho ho!|
96593|What's that big hand?|
96594|The purple and black hand?|
96595|#822$#That's created from the collected will of the dead.
#821$#I formed it into the shape of a hand.|
96596|#821$#Why don't you go take a look if you're interested?
#822$#You could be dragged into another world, haha.|
96597|#821$#The will of the dead is very strong,
#822$#don't be careless...|
96598|#821$#Magic claws are useful against enemies.
#822$#I don't have to dismember and carry things myself, isn't it nifty?|
96599|You like organs?|
96600|Your interest is very particular.|
96601|#821$#I don't just like bloody things!
#822$#I'm mesmerized by the hidden meanings...
#821$#The hidden meaning within these organs, hehe.|
96602|#822$#In your world,
#821$#It would be the same interest as a Biologist.|
96603|#822$#It's not something special in Acheron.
#821$#There are special customs and practises in each land, don't you say?|
96604|#822$#My interests are not well accepted in your world...
#821$#The people here are more close-minded than in Acheron.|
96605|Cyan Flames|
96606|Can I touch the Foul Stream?|
96607|#821$#You'd like to touch the Foul Stream?
#822$#It wouldn't cause me any harm...
#821$#I can't guarantee the same for others.|
96608|#822$#The Foul Stream is as common to me as oxygen.
#821$#It's just a simple gas.|
96609|#822$#Humans will always march towards danger.
#821$#Do the Foul Streams around me look like something you can play with?|
96610|#821$#There are people who think that the Foul Stream symbolizes flames of hatred.
#822$#How funny, it's just a different structure from normal fire.|
96611|Your clothes are beautiful|
96612|Your clothes are nice|
96613|#821$#You are quite the charmer, huh?
#822$#But I don't despise such talk.|
96614|#821$#Are you curious about the clothing material?
#822$#Hmm, should I tell you?
#821$#You would be too shocked.|
96615|#822$#Hah, you have good taste.
#821$#I can make one for you if you like this style.
#822$#But you'll have to gather the required materials...|
96616|#821$#The bone accessory on my shoulders are beautiful too.
#822$#These are human bones, do you want to touch them?|
96617|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
96618|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
96619|#821$#Muramasa's aura is similar to mine.
#822$#We have similar painful pasts...
#822$#Please bring some Acheron wine to her, heh...|
96620|#822$#I'm not used to socialising...
#821$#I should ask you this question.
#822$#Do you know about Amaterasu? Amaterasu
#824$#Please tell me if you know something.|
96621|#821$#After hearing this, I remember something quite unpleasant.
#824$#Uriel was abnormally warm...
#822$#I can't stand such high temperatures, I wonder what his body composition is like.|
96622|#822$#I don't really mix with others.
#821$#Are you asking the wrong person?|
96623|The Dead in Acheron|
96624|About the dead souls in Acheron|
96625|#821$#The dead souls in Acheron have different will...
#822$#But most of that willpower will dissipate over time.
#821$#They will finally accept their deaths and stay in Acheron.|
96626|#822$#Are you curious about the dead?
#821$#Why don't you experience it yourself? Hahaha, it's just a joke.|
96627|#821$#Just like in your world,
#822$#the dead have many types of personalities.
#821$#They were once humans, no?|
96628|#822$#You want to get more information on the dead? What a brave child...
#823$#Should I bring you for a tour around Acheron?|
96629|Acheron?|
96630|About the place you live in|
96631|#822$#So you're interested in my abode.
#821$#feel free to visit when you have the time.|
96632|#821$#It's not bright like this place,
#822$#it's damp and dark.
#824$#Heh, I just recalled my first time in Acheron...|
96633|#821$#It's the Kingdom of the Dead...
#822$#Normal people are not allowed to enter.
#821$#But I can lead you there if you wish for it.|
96634|#822$#I've tried to leave Acheron before.
#824$#Thanks to someone, I've given up that thought.|
96635|Can we talk about your marriage?|
96636|I've heard that you are married?|
96637|#822$#You'd like to know huh.
#821$#There's a price to pay for the truth...
#822$#Let's see, how about a body part?|
96638|#821$#Ack, don't you think it's crass to ask such a question?
#822$#I'll forgive you since you're so cute.
#823$#But next time, heh...|
96639|#824$#I don't want to think about that person, but...
#821$#If I can see him again...
#823$#I will silence him forever.|
96640|#821$#You're quite rude.
#822$#Should I teach you some manners?|
96641|What's your most unforgettable experience?|
96642|Do you have any memorable experiences?|
96643|#821$#I've been in Acheron for so long,
#822$#yet there were no particularly memorable experiences.|
96644|#821$#Memorable experience...Maybe the time when I just arrived in Acheron.
#822$#That person came to look for me...
#824$#If only he never appeared...|
96645|#821$#Everything feels memorable here.
#822$#It's been sometime since I've experienced such a novel feeling.|
96646|#822$#Do you want to create some memorable experience with me?
#821$#Heh, your bashfulness is so cute.|
96647|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
96648|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
96649|#822$#Parting ways? Until then...
#823$#I hope to get your little finger as a goodbye gift.
#822$#Why can't you do that? Such a pity...|
96650|#824$#After parting ways, I will go back to Acheron.
#821$#Are you bored of me?|
96651|#822$#I don't mind if you want to leave.
#823$#You can go away, but you'll have to leave your organs here.
#822$#Stop shaking so much, it was just a joke, haha...|
96652|#824$#Are you abandoning me like that person?
#823$#This time I won't let you escape!|
96653|What's your favorite food?|
96654|What do you normally eat?|
96655|#822$#Food from the human realm? Hmm, I guess fried rice with eggs.
#823$#It's magical how something so delicious can be cooked with such basic ingredients.|
96656|#822$#Why are you asking this, are you hungry? It's not our break time yet.
#823$#Are you tired? Fine, since you've been so serious, let's have a rest.
#821$#You can't keep doing this, we made a promise to become stronger.|
96657|#821$#Apparently chocolates are given as gifts during Valentine's Day.
#823$#The sweet chocolate with bitter aftertaste, is that how love feels like?|
96658|#823$#I will accept any food as long as it's made with love.|
96659|Is there anything that scares you?|
96660|What are you afraid of?|
96661|#824$#My childhood fear was being left in absolute darkness...
#823$#I won't be afraid of the dark now since you are here.|
96662|#821$#Of course there's...there's nothing I fear.
#824$#Ghosts??? How did you find out?

#823$#Let me play a tune for you to chase away your fear.|

#823$#my heart will calm down even though I'm scared.|
96665|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
96666|How do you kill time?|

96678|How do you train yourself?|

#822$#But brother's style is not too suitable for me...|
96680|#822$#Others train for an hour, but I need three.
#821$#You can only improve by keeping this attitude.|
96681|#822$#You can increase your training efficiency by training with someone who has similar goals.
#821$#I always perform music with Aelius and Muse.|
96682|#822$#After a whole day of training, I will meditate to review my progress.

96687|#822$#Are you interested in the history of that place? I'd like to tell you everything about it...
#823$#It's more interesting if you experience it yourself.|

96689|What do you think of the Blizzard Berg?|

#821$#Please don't go there alone, okay?|
96693|#822$#It's the resting place of an ancient dragon...Nevermind, it's just an old legend...|

#824$#But now it has been engulfed by the flames of war...|
96695|Have there been any recent events?|
96696|Are there any special quests we can go on?|
96697|#822$#Have you checked the map? There are places marked with a star or an exclamation mark on your map.

#823$#But the most glorious life is lived during a human's youth.|
96717|#821$#Why do you ask me this suddenly? Are you afraid of growing old?

96745|#824$#Thanks to my father... I do have quite a few siblings.|
96746|#822$#You mean Aelius and Serena?
#821$#They're my brother and sister, who symbolize the sun and the moon respectively.|
96747|#821$#Have you heard of my brother?
#823$#He might not look like much in a group of gods,
#823$#but he's a great craftsman in heaven. He created "Merci" for me!|
96748|#822$#Astraea is my sister, she is quite similar to my brother.
#821$#But they seem to have fallen out after a war.|
96749|Do you like music at all?|
96750|What kind of music do you normally like to listen to?|

#823$#That's why she encourages me to learn more from humans.|
96759|#823$#Do you know Mother? That's great, I was wondering how to introduce her to you.|
96760|#822$#Mother is a very direct person who treats someone she likes well...
#823$#I take care of you? Of course! That's because you're good to me.|
96761|It seems you really cherish this violin.|
96762|What is your weapon?|
96763|#823$#This is a present from my brother!

96764|#821$#I've called this violin "Merci", it's always by my side to remind me,
#822$#that I should always be grateful and kind even in the human realm.|
96765|#823$#This is a present from my brother before I left heaven.
#821$#Violins from the human world can never compare to it.
#823$#I can play you a tune if you want to hear it.|
96766|#822$#Brother knows I love the glimmer of sapphire.

96769|#822$#Why do you ask me this suddenly? Hmm, I recall that day.
#823$#I will use this violin to pray for you, and bless you with a beautiful future.|
96770|#824$#I will go back to my hometown and pray for you.|
96771|#824$#Are you dying soon? Don't worry, I'll ask father.
#823$#Father will allow us to be together forever.|
96772|#821$#I will compose a beautiful song to commemorate our meeting.
#823$#Every time I play this tune, I will think of you.|
96773|What's your favorite food?|
96774|What do you normally eat?|
96775|#821$#Sweet, yet sour. This must be the smell of lemon cake!

#823$#Eirene loves the sweet and sour combination.|

#822$#Wow... it's like you can read Eirene's mind.|

96779|What's your favorite type of music?|
96780|What kind of music do you listen to?|
96781|#821$#Master, have you heard a wind harp before?

96782|#821$#Eirene loves to hear the sound of the wind harp echoing through these halls.
#822$#I love it when the sound of music fills these corridors.
#822$#It reminds me how we are all of one consciousness.|
96783|#821$#The sound of the harp... it's breathtaking.
#823$#Eirene loves to hear music that can soothe the soul.|

96785|What do you think is the most incredible thing in the world?|
96786|What's the most marvelous experience you've had?|
96787|#821$#Master... what do you know about water? There are so many different types and so many different temperatures.
#822$#This gentle shape feels good to the touch. I can cup it in my palm.|
96788|#823$#Eirene still remembers the first time she experienced the four seasons. It was incredible!
#822$#The temperatures, the sounds, the atmosphere. Amazing!
#821$#The changing of the seasons is a thing of beauty.|
96789|#821$#This world is full of things beyond my comprehension.
#822$#There are so many smells and sounds, so many things to explore!
#821$#If only I could see it...|
96790|#823$#However, meeting you has been the most amazing experience Eirene has ever had.|
96791|Changing seasons?|
96792|What's your favorite season?|
96793|#821$#Every season has its own wonder. I love this world! I love every inch of it!|
96794|#821$#I can smell the changing seasons in the air. I can feel it in my bones.
#822$#The spring breeze, the summer heat, the crisp fall air, the refreshing cold of winter...
#823$#Being blind means I have to use my other senses to observe the seasons.|
96795|#823$#If I had to guess, I'd say it's winter now.
#821$#I can feel the winter chill in my bones. I know that it's wintertime now.|
96796|#823$#Eirene likes winter. Did you know Eirene was born in winter?
#821$#Master, do you believe it?|
96797|About holidays?|
96798|Do you know what holidays are?|
96799|#821$#Eirene knows that there are many festivals in this world.
#823$#I love it when everyone celebrates together. It makes Eirene feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
#821$#Eirene wants to experience all these things with Master as well.|
96800|#823$#Every day Eirene is with master is a beautiful day.|
96801|#821$#Eirene loves Christmas. Yay Christmas!
#823$#Everyone is laughing, roasting chestnuts by the fire!
#822$#Still, the stove is really hot. Eirene doesn't want to get too close to it.|
96802|#822$#Master, do you know about Christmas?
#821$#Eirene loves the Christmas season with the hollies and Christmas carols.
#822$#...I want to know what it looks like. Can you describe it to me, master?|
96803|Have you been to Navea yet?|
96804|Heard of Navea?|
96805|#821$#Navea... isn't that where you were born?
#822$#It's not? Then..where were you born, Master?|
96806|#821$#... Navea? Eirene doesn't know anything about that place.
#822$#Huh? A white and blue building with a beautiful roof? What's that about?
#821$#It sounds pretty good, but... white... blue? What does that mean? I am blind, you know.|
96807|#823$#Navea must be a very beautiful place.
#821$#Hmm? It's a center for trade and commerce?
#823$#Master, tell me more about Navea!|
96808|#821$#Eirene once went somewhere with lots of sights and smells.
#821$#I heard steel clanging against steel, the cries of dying men and the boom of cannons.
#823$#Was that in Navea? I think it's a good place.|
96809|Tell me about some of the places you've seen.|
96810|Where have you traveled?|
96811|#821$#There is also a place where you can sense the approaching autumn and smell the fragrant flowers...
#822$#Ha! Crescent Hill! That's right! How did you guess that so fast, Master?|
96812|#821$#Eirene once went to a place with salty water and a cool, crisp breeze.
#823$#The smell of juicy fruit filled the air. I also could hear the sound of gnashing gears...
#821$#That's right, Master: Helonia Coast!|
96813|#821$#Master, have you heard about the famous Frigga Peak? Eirene already loves winter!
#822$#...but I'm sure it's still too cold for you in the winter, right Master?|
96814|#821$#Eirene has been to desert sands, where the air is hot and dry.
#822$#Patience is a virtue, but Eirene is not a virtuous at all! I can't wait! The suspense is killing me!|
96815|Do you know what the Holy vs Evil Showdown is?|
96816|Have you heard about the Holy vs Evil Showdown?|
96817|#821$#This entire place is just a simulation developed by the Magic Division.
#821$#You must tell apart good from evil. Which side will you choose?|
96818|#821$#In this simulation, rival armies can battle one another.
#822$#However... is holiness necessarily good? Is evil necessarily bad?|
96819|#822$#That's war... Eirene does not like war.|
96820|#821$#Is that really where you wanna go? Why can't everyone be nice and get along with each other...|
96821|Can you explain me what the Eidolon Archive is?|
96822|Eidolon Archive?|
96823|#821$#Simulation? Illustration? Like in picture books?
#822$#Eirene is not really a bookworm.
#821$#If you want something regarding books, you should visit Eternia.|
96824|#821$#This is something you hear about in everyday life. That's for sure.
#823$#Eirene loves to lend an ear to others.|
96825|#821$#Master, I can rattle on about everyone's private affairs.
#823$#The more allies you have, the more you'll get to know the surrounding community.|
96826|#821$#Master, has anything weird been going on with your allies lately? Is there anything you could shed some light on for me?
#823$#You sure are a curious person, Master. I hope you can go and make more friends. They will help you in battle.|
96827|Transmitting Information|
96828|About Mail.|
96829|#821$#Letters are another great way to communicate.
#822$#Still... I prefer talking to people face-to-face...|
96830|#821$#Eirene has never received any letters...
#822$#I wish someone would send me one...|
96831|#821$#Could Master send a letter to Eirene?
#822$#This is great, but... Eirene can't read it...|
96832|#821$#Eirene's always envied those who get letters.
#822$#Would Master be willing to write a letter to Eirene?|
96833|Do you like to sing?|
96834|How did manage to like that?|
96835|#821$#Eirene loves to sing for other people. Sometimes they sneak me into concert halls at night to sing.
#823$#That building... people often go there to write songs or poems.|
96836|#821$#This sounds absolutely wonderful! Thanks so much for your help!
#822$#Do you know a lot of songs, Master? Eirene loves to hear different voices!|
96837|#821$#Eirene has learned a lot about this world from singing to her master...
#822$#What... what were those songs I used to sing?|
96838|#821$#Amazing grace, that melody is so sweet... it makes me want to keep moving forward!
#821$#I once was lost, but now I'm back on my feet. I once was blind but now I seeee!
#823$#Did you like that, Master? I learned these songs in the human world.|
96839|Why are your eyes closed?|
96840|Can't... can't you see?|
96841|#821$#There are so many things that you can't see with your eyes, but you CAN see with your heart!
#823$#Eirene knows what is around her without having to actually see.|
96842|#821$#Maybe Eirene's eyes are closed because she's sleeping, right?
#823$#Nah, just kidding... Eirene is blind; that is true.
#822$#War? I may not be able to see it but I definitely can feel it in my bones.|
96843|#821$#Eirene sees only darkness, but she can hear and feel everything around her
#822$# and yet... Eirene really wishes she could see this world...|
96844|#822$#I may not be able to see, but I can feel everything there is to feel.
#821$#Master, these are your eyes... this is your nose... this is your face...
#823$#No, Master. Let me touch your face. Do not be afraid...|
96845|Is there anything that scares you?|
96846|What are you afraid of?|
96847|#822$#Master, I really do love talking to you.|
96848|#821$#Eirene is afraid that Master will go away one day...|
96849|#821$#Eirene is afraid of silence... Eirene is afraid she will no longer exist in this world one day...
#824$#Voices... are my only connection to this world...|
96850|#824$#When the sounds stop, there is only darkness...|
96851|Do you know the old man wearing a red coat and flying a herd of reindeer?|
96852|Do you know the old man in the red suit who gives out presents?|
96853|#822$#The old man in red... well, I can't see so how can I know he's even wearing red?
#823$#Still... I seem to bump into this man every winter.
#821$#He has lots of animals with antlers... he's quite a strange bird.|
96854|#822$#Master, are you looking for that old man?
#821$#Eirene does not know where he is right now, but she knows a guy who can find anyone at any time.
#823$#He'll find the children of each house and give them a gift.
#821$#Eirene will ask him to help you.|
96855|#822$#Send gifts... old man... reindeer?
#821$#Wait a minute... does he have a sleigh?
#823$#Eirene knows the old man. Master, do you need something from him?|
96856|#823$#Master, do you want a present? Master, you are being really childish.|
96857|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
96858|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
96859|#823$#I perceive those sweet smells every time I pass over Tyr.
#821$#Tyr will never fess up to it. Why is that? What an amazing taste!|
96860|#821$#I heard that there's a love perfume... Master, have you heard anything about it?
#821$#The smell of perfume is really enchanting.
#822$#The sweet scent from the perfume bottle... it scared the pants off Eirene.|
96861|#821$#Izanami's words make it hard to get close to her.
#822$#but I can hear the pain in her voice. It is all so clear to me...|
96862|#821$#Master... have you ever heard Hebe play the harp before?
#823$#Eirene used to compose music with Hebe back in the day.
#821$#She'd play her harp and I'd sing the lyrics. What a team we were!|
96863|The presence of war?|
96864|What do you think about war?|
96865|#822$#... Eirene does not like war.
#822$#No, I'd rather say I HATE it!|
96866|#822$#All I am saying is give peace a chance.|
96867|#822$#What problems have ever been solved by fighting? I can't think of one.
#824$#This is all too much for Eirene to bear...|
96868|#822$#The clash of steel, the spilling of blood. NO! And I really mean it!
#824$#No! These sounds! I must get rid of them! I cannot take this anymore!|
96869|What sounds and tastes do you like, master?|
96870|Which sounds are most pleasing to your ear? What tastes tickle your taste buds?|
96871|#821$#As for me? I love juicy, fresh fruit!
#823$#Thank you, Master. This is delicious!|
96872|#821$#Oh, it's so hard to choose. There are so many sounds that I just adore!|
96873|#821$#Master... do you like perfume?
#823$#You can smell it once, twice or a hundred times and it will still have some kind of effect.
#821$#The smell of perfume can be absolutely intoxicating.|
96874|#823$#Eirene loves the sound of our voices, when we laugh, when we sing...
#821$#It's really amazing. Everyone's voice is unique.|
96875|I heard that you have two sisters, is that true?|
96876|About the three goddess sequence...|
96877|#821$#One of Eirene's sisters is in charge of maintaining law and order.
#822$#Eirene is not only smart, but intellectually curious. She seeks to understand this vast world of ours.|
96878|#821$#Justice reigns as long as she is here. No evildoer shall be able to tip its scales.
#822$#However, other people fear my sisters. For reasons unknown to me.|
96879|#821$#It is their solemn duty to maintain law and order at all costs.
#822$#Law, order, peace... these are necessary for a functioning society.|
96880|#822$#Has Master met Eirene's sisters yet?
#821$#They're good people; that's for sure. One represents law, and one represents order.
#823$#Who is Eirene? Eirene is peace.|
96881|Do you like this world?|
96882|What do you think of this world?|
96883|#823$#Eirene loves everything about this world.
#821$#There's so much more just waiting for Eirene to explore!|
96884|#821$#This world is what brought Eirene and her master together again.
#823$#Eirene is forever thankful to this world.|
96885|#821$#This world is filled with smells and sounds of various types.
#823$#The beauty in this world is obvious, even if you can't see it.|
96886|#821$#Eirene will never forget the beauty she's seen from this world.|
96887|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
96888|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
96889|#821$#Eirene will miss the sweet sound of her master's voice...|
96890|#821$#Eirene cannot see the tears falling down her face but can hear the sadness in her heart.|
96891|#824$#Master, do no you want to be Eirene's eyes any longer?|
96892|#821$#Master... if you leave...
#824$#You will take Eirene's favorite sound in the whole world away with you...|
96893|What's your favorite food?|
96894|What do you normally eat?|
96895|#821$# Blueberry cake very similar in color to the Hydrangea flower.
#823$# Sweet and sour... with yogurt... Demeter is craving it now~|
96896|#821$# Blueberry cake, but Demeter likes anything as long as it is cake.
#823$# After all, Demeter can't eat these things in the forest~|
96897|#821$# Before this, I only had fruits, mushrooms, and insects in the forest...
#822$# Eh? What is that expression, Master... Did Demeter say something weird?|
96898|#823$# Heehee~ If it's Master's treat, Demeter likes eating anything~|
96899|Do you admire anyone?|
96900|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
96901|#821$# Demeter loves Master!
#822$# Of course, Demeter also loves Petra and everyone in the forest.|
96902|#822$# Petra's eyes are round and very cute~
#823$# And her body is so soft and nice to touch. Would Master want to touch her too?|
96903|#821$# Demeter likes honest people...
#822$# Master wouldn't lie to Demeter right...|
96904|#821$# Demeter has never thought specially of anybody before.
#823$# But now, there is one. Who is it? Hehehe...|
96905|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
96906|What do you do in your free time?|
96907|#821$# Bring Petra for a walk to Crescent Hill's flower field~
#822$# A sea of fragrant purple flowers, how refreshing...
#821$# Master, don't just sit around all the time. Come take a walk with Demeter sometimes~|
96908|#821$# Demeter usually arranges the flowerbeds and waters them~
#822$# Sometimes Demeter waters them too much and the flowers and grass grow everywhere...
#821$# Petra~ I can hear you laughing!|
96909|#821$# Demeter will talk to the local Sprites when bored~
#822$# We talk about the recent happenings and exchange information...
#821$# Demeter always hears them talking about Master~|
96910|#823$# It's great to lie on the grass and soak in the sun~
#822$# Demeter can feel the sun... and it's slowly giving Demeter energy~
#821$# Eh, Master can't do it? Even Petra would say...|
96911|About life?|
96912|The meaning of life?|
96913|#821$# Demeter feels that as long as Demeter lives, it is enough~
#822$# No matter monsters, animals, or plants, they are all the same.|
96914|#821$# Although Demeter was born with the ability to make life more abundant, 
#824$# Demeter can't create or prolong life...
#822$# But Demeter will take good care of Master!|
96915|#821$# Once life is gone, you cannnot get it back...
#824$# Even Demeter is helpless...
#822$# So Master should stay close to Demeter, and not simply run around~|
96916|#821$# Life is not in the hands of Demeter. Demeter can't be sure...|
96917|Who are you talking to?|
96918|Who's there?|
96919|#821$# Hmmph... Demeter is talking to my friend~
#823$# We happened to be talking about Master, heehee~
#822$# What did we talk about? It's a see~ cret~|
96920|#821$# Who? It's Demeter's friend. I can introduce him to you Master...
#822$# Oh... but he's quite shy. Maybe next time I will try again. |
96921|#821$# My good friends live here, and there are many of them~
#824$# Master? Why are you going away...|
96922|#821$# Oh... Master, Demeter is talking to him about you~
#823$# If Master doesn't mind, you're welcome to join us~
#824$# ...really, does Master think Demeter was talking to no one?
#822$# Master, you see... they're just smaller in size~|
96923|Have you ever been to Frigga Peak?|
96924|Do you know about Frigga Peak?|
96925|#821$# Master should think carefully before going to that place~
#822$# It's very cold there and it snows all the time...
#824$# Even the strongest monsters can't bear the cold...|
96926|#821$# Demeter doesn't like it there... it's too cold for anything to grow...
#824$# Even with Demeter's abilities, the moment the plant grows a little, it will freeze...
#824$# Demeter can't do anything about it...|
96927|#821$# Demeter doesn't like that place...
#824$# Many animals have disappeared there...
#822$# I know that Master is strong... but don't make Demeter worry, okay?|
96928|#821$# Frigga Peak is just ice and cold...
#822$# You should stay here where it's warm, Master. You have lots of friends, food, and comfortable things here...
#821$# Why does Master want to go there?|
96929|Have you ever been to Chronology Forest?|
96930|Do you know about Chronology Forest?|
96931|#821$# Demeter and Petra has gone there before~
#822$# There's lots of trees there, and also lots of friendly Butterfly Fairies~
#821$# Demeter has been invited to visit the Butterfly Thicket. Demeter wonders how they're doing now.|
96932|#821$# Demeter doesn't know what it is like in Chronology Forest now...
#822$# From what Demeter hears from forest friends, it is not as peaceful as before.
#821$# Does Master know anything about it?|
96933|#821$# Demeter has some wonderful friends living there~
#822$# They look like little chickens, but feel like Jelly when you touch them, and they even walk in a wobbly manner,
#823$# and they can dance beautifully~|
96934|#822$# There's a large lake in the forest~
#821$# But it has a weird aura... Demeter doesn't like the feeling...|
96935|Can you tell me about the Sanctuary Farm?|
96936|Do you know anything about the Sanctuary Farm?|
96937|#821$# Does Master want Demeter's help?
#822$# No Master, relying on Demeter's abilities is cheating, hoho~|
96938|#821$# Maybe it's better if Master asks the experts in the Sanctuary Farm...
#822$# Because... Once Demeter plants and waters them, they will be ready for harvest immediately~|
96939|#822$# I've heard that Otter are trained to collect minerals. Can Petra do that too?
#821$# Huh? Where's Petra... Master, did you see her?|
96940|#821$# It is said that when Hatchlings are added to the breeding area, they will multiply~
#822$# Will the fish grow better if Master adds more water?
#824$# Master? Why did you stop me...|
96941|Can you introduce the Eternal Codex to me?|
96942|What is the Eternal Codex?|
96943|#821$# We have a special connection. Demeter has heard that it is a book which recalls your past~
#822$# Eternia has mentioned it before... but Demeter can't really remember much.|
96944|#821$# Eternal Codex... Demeter hears it can look into the past...
#822$# Master... is there something you want to see?
#823$# Demeter wants to look back at the time when Demeter first met Master...|
96945|#821$# The Codex... that shows memories? Something like a photo album...?
#822$# Does Master like to take pictures for memories?
#823$# Demeter wants to know how Master used to look~|
96946|#822$# Eternal Codex? Is it for seeing the past?
#821$# Recalling the past... does Master need more explanation? Master is strange~
#822$# But Demeter wants to know more about Master~|
96947|Can you tell me more about the Card Duel?|
96948|Regarding the Card Duel|
96949|#821$# In the human world, there seems to be a card duel game~
#822$# If this can replace actual war, Demeter wants to learn more~|
96950|#821$# Does Master like to collect cards? Demeter wants to see what cards Master has~
#822$# Huh~ Why won't you show me~ Master is mean~|
96951|#821$# Demeter hears that there is a card duel team in Ventos Prairie~
#822$# Master should challenge them. Demeter will cheer for Master~|
96952|#821$# Demeter hears that every friend has their own card,
#822$# so will Demeter and Petra have our own cards?
#823$# If Demeter and Petra have cards... Master should let Demeter play~|
96953|Have you ever heard of the God of Harvest?|
96954|Do you know about the God of Harvest?|
96955|#822$# We have a special connection. Demeter used to help peope harvest their crops...
#821$# But Demeter realised after that... that only a few people owned all the crops...
#824$# They cheated Demeter and didn't share the harvest. After that, Demeter decided to leave them...|
96956|#822$# Demeter has not heard that name for a long time~
#821$# Now that Demeter thinks about it, humans are such forgetful creatures, sigh~
#824$# For Demeter's sake... Demeter should forget about the agreement...
#823$# However, Master is special~|
96957|#821$# But then... people used to praise Demeter...
#824$# But... their praises has hidden lies...
#824$# Demeter was hurt by this and went back to live in the forest...
#821$# Master... Do you think Demeter was impulsive?|
96958|#821$# Master actually knew Demeter's name. Were you checking up on Demeter?
#822$# But Demeter's name... It's no longer important to Demeter.|
96959|What is that flower on you?|
96960|What is this flower?|
96961|#821$# This is a Hydrangea~
#822$# Even though you can easily find it, Demeter loves this flower~
#823$# Maybe Master should also put some on your head, hehe~|
96962|#821$# Does Master like this flower?
#822$# It's a Hydrangea, also known as a Hortensia.
#823$# It's amazing how the colors of flowers change when they're in different places~|
96963|#821$# The Hydrangea is very beautiful, but it's also poisonous for humans~
#822$# If Master accidentally eats it, it can make you have stomach pains and feel like vomiting...
#823$# But don't worry, Master. Demeter will take care of you if that happens~|
96964|#824$# Huh, doesn't Master know this? This is Demeter's favorite flower...
#822$# Demeter will not tell Master! Sigh~
#821$# If Master cares about Demeter, Master should find out himself.
#822$#... The name of the flower is... Hydrangea. Master must remember this~|
96965|Regarding your pet|
96966|Can you introduce your pet?|
96967|#822$# Petra isn't a pet! She's Demeter's friend.
#823$# If Master calls her a pet, Demeter will be angry, hmmph~|
96968|#822$# Petra is not a pet. She's in charge of protecting Demeter.
#821$# And... She's one of the forest's Sacred Beast and guardian of the forest,
#824$# and it was rude of Master to call her a pet!|
96969|#822$# Petra is Petra~ She's Demeter's friend...not a pet~
#821$# During a storm in the forest, Demeter came across Petra... she had lost her parents...
#824$# Petra was cold and shivering, and she looked so pitiful...
#823$# But the good thing is that she's now strong enough to protect others~|
96970|#822$# Petra is Demeter's important friend, not a pet~
#821$# Master... Is also a friend? It doesn't feel the same...
#823$# For Demeter... Master is something special~|
96971|Are you easily fooled?|
96972|Why do you so easily believe what others say?|
96973|#822$# It is hard to fool Demeter!
#821$# People were very hungry, and they came to Demeter for help...
#824$# Looking at their pitiful appearance... and since they promised Demeter, Demeter...
#822$# In other words... If Master repeats that again, Demeter will ignore Master, hmmph~|
96974|#821$# Demeter believes what everyone says~
#822$# If we cannot trust one another... Doesn't the world become a lie...
#824$# It'll be just like those people...|
96975|#823$#Do you agree?
#821$# Demeter thought a long time about it~
#824$# But Demeter didn't know why..|
96976|#821$# Master~ It is the fault of those who lie~
#822$# When there are no lies, no one will be deceived, right?|
96977|I want to know some more Eidolon secrets.|
96978|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
96979|#821$# Uriel was warm and friendly, but he was always surrounded by flames...
#824$# It was really hot... Demeter has bad memories about it...|
96980|#822$# Ayako eats like a starving bird!
#821$# He was invited to the harvest festival, and then...
#824$# He... He ate more than half a year's worth of food... It almost caused a famine...|
96981|#821$# Does Master know Kitami? She is very cute~
#823$# Her smooth and shiny fur reminds Demeter of Demeter's childhood~
#822$# But don't you calling anyone cute except Demeter and Petra, hehe~|
96982|#822$# Has Master heard the voice of Eirene?
#823$# Her voice sounds heavenly, and it's fascinating...
#821$# If only Demeter could sing too~|
96983|Your outfit looks good|
96984|What a beautiful outfit|
96985|#821$# Master has good taste~
#823$# Demeter made this outfit herself~|
96986|#822$# Does Master like Demeter's outfit too?
#821$# From the butterfly lace of the top, to the lace of the skirt, Demeter sewed it all~
#823$# Heehee~ Demeter is good at making things~|
96987|#823$# Haha~ Master's words are sweet. Did Master do anything wrong?
#821$# Master can tell Demeter, and Demeter won't be angry~
#823$# Demeter is joking, and thank you Master for the compliments~|
96988|#821$# Thank you, Master. Demeter's outfit isn't just for show~
#822$# Because of Demeter's abilities... Even if there's a stain or tear, the outfit will clean and heal itself,
#823$# and it will look like new again. Does Master want one too? Hehehe...|
96989|Tell me about your weapon.|
96990|What is your weapon?|
96991|#821$# It's not Demeter's weapon. It's a watering device~
#822$# It can help all plants to grow faster and healthier~
#821$# If Master wants to plant something, be sure to let Demeter handle it.|
96992|#821$# As for Demeter's armor, it's all the plants around Demeter~
#822$# There are those with thorns, poisonous ones, and also some which can eat humans~
#824$# But they're all in the forest, so I can't introduce them to Master...|
96993|#821$# Demeter doesnt need a weapon because Demeter has Petra and Master~
#823$# Compared to actual weapons, Demeter feels safer this way~|
96994|#822$# Is Master... referring to the watering device...
#821$# Other than watering the flowers, Master wants to know what else it can do?
#823$# You can use it to hit someone... Does Master want to try?|
96995|Is it true that you are afraid of fire?|
96996|What are you afraid of?|
96997|#821$# Has Master heard that a single spark can start a fire?
#824$# One small fire can burn down a whole forest...
#822$# ...Master must not simply start fires~|
96998|#821$# Fire is good for a lot of things...
#824$# But it doesn't mean you can easily control it. It's more dangerous than Master can imagine...|
96999|#824$# Demeter is afraid of fire... Because Demeter's most precious things can easily be burned into nothing...|
97000|#824$# Can Master not talk about this?
#821$# Demeter would prefer to talk about happy things with Master~|
97001|Do you like this world?|
97002|What do you think of this world?|
97003|#821$# If Master asks if Demeter likes it or not~
#822$# Demeter loves this world~ Even though there are things that make Demeter sad...|
97004|#822$# Demeter loves the world that has Petra and Master...
#823$# Does Master like the world?|
97005|#822$# Demeter loves the world because there are so many nice friends here~
#824$# But as the war continues on, Demeter sees less and less of them...
#821$# Demeter is worried about Demeter's friends...|
97006|#821$# Demeter has heard some people say that the world is beautiful but cruel,
#822$# and Demeter thinks they are right~|
97007|Have you thought about your life, after we part ways?|
97008|What's your plan for after we part ways?|
97009|#824$# ...Demeter will return to the forest with Petra and wait for Master to return...
#822$# When Demeter is not here, Master must take good care of himself~
#821$# Remember to eat all your meals... and don't do anything dangerous...|
97010|#824$# Demeter wishes Master would not mention it...
#822$# Otherwise Demeter will tell Petra to bite Master, hmmph~|
97011|#821$# Demeter will respect Master's decision...
#824$# But Demeter still wants to be with Master forever...|
97012|#824$# De... For the first time Demeter hopes Master is lying...
#824$# I don't know... Maybe I've just seen so much. This is why humans lie?|
97013|Usual leisure activities?|
97014|#821$#I've been busy governing the pandemonium.|
97015|#821$#There's no time for anything else other than my duties in the pandemonium.
#822$#Maybe meeting you can be considered one.|
97016|Tell me the best strategy for facing a powerful enemy.|
97017|#821$#No one can ever call themselves powerful in front of me.|
97018|#821$#Power is might, I respect whoever is mighty.|
97019|What do you like?|
97020|#821$#I have no special likes.|
97021|#821$#The only things I like are black sheeps and cows in black yarn.
#822$#What is the reason behind? There is no reason explaining my preferences.|
97022|Is there anything that scares you?|
97023|#821$#I've never been afraid of anything. Only the weak fear.|
97024|#821$#There's nothing that scares me.
#822$#Or should I say that I'm fearless now.|
97025|What's your most unforgettable experience?|
97026|#821$#I was in the dark pandemonium when I saw a beam of familiar light, then I arrived at this place.|
97027|#821$#A strong, depthless power summoned me here.
#822$#It was memorable to meet you.|
97028|Have you heard about Port Skandia?|
97029|#821$#I have no interest in the human world, I've not heard of this place.|
97030|#821$#Humans fear my existence, I've rarely stepped foot in the human world or this place.
#822$#Is that your hometown? ...So what?|
97031|Any favourite places?|
97032|#821$#I am partial to the Shattered Netherworld, it has the same atmosphere as the Pandemonium Abyss.|
97033|#821$#The Ghostweep Cave is similar to my castle, I see many forgotten souls there.|
97034|About the Holy vs Evil Showdown.|
97035|#821$#I'm only interested in the battle of royal powers, nothing else.|
97036|#821$#Human wars do not interest me, what is the goal if it's not to seize more royal power?|
97037|About the Eternal Codex.|
97038|#821$#I'm only interested in the present, the past does not concern me.|
97039|#821$#My past is sealed, you can only read about your past in this tome.|
97040|About the Eidolons' Oath.|
97041|#821$#Are you prepared to pay the price to seal a bind with me?|
97042|#821$#I only deal with the Mighty, it seems like he has appeared.|
97043|Changing seasons?|
97044|#821$#Only winter in the human world can keep what I hold dearly.|
97045|#821$#I hate spring in the human world.
#822$#It seems like it will take away something I hold dearly...|
97046|Tell me about the Pandemonium.|
97047|#821$#The Pandemonium is where dead souls go, do you want to go there too?|
97048|#821$#I govern the Pandemonium, but you shouldn't go there now.|
97049|Your chair look so nice.|
97050|#821$#Do you want to sit in my throne? ... Then show me your strength.|
97051|#821$#It was built with the bones of the dead,
#822$#you can't handle it without a strong will.|
97052|Views on love.|
97053|#821$#I'm only interested in power and the throne.
#822$#Love does not interest me.|
97054|#821$#You shouldn't ask such questions.|
97055|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97056|#821$#Before Bahadur came to the Pandemonium, he had a grand labyrinth.
#822$#His labyrinth seems like the reason why he's in the Pandemonium.|
97057|#821$#I've always been against Demeter, I can't answer anything about him.|
97058|Views on power.|
97059|#821$#If you have power, you can control anything.|
97060|#821$#I'm power itself, an undefeatable power.|
97061|Do you possess a special helm?|
97062|#821$#Before I've lent this helm to a pesky boy,
#822$#I do not wish to have anything to do with him.|
97063|#821$#I have an invisible helm, do you wish to borrow it? Why are you smiling so creepily?|
97064|Are you cold and heartless?|
97065|#821$#I embody strict law.
#822$#I do not care what others think of me.|
97066|#821$#Do you see me as such?|
97067|Do you like plants?|
97068|#821$#The king has no special feelings for plants and flowers.
#822$#Peppermint Grass? This reminds me of that girl...|
97069|#821$#The white poplar was important to me once; now it's guarding my Holy Tree.|
97070|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97071|#821$#Your questions annoy me.
#822$#Looks like you don't have the makings of sharing the throne with me.|
97072|#821$#I do not consider and answer questions of the far future.|
97073|Will you go out by yourself at night?|
97074|#821$#Hermes has made a habit of going out alone at night!
#822$#Do you want to know what he does when he goes out?
#821$#Hah! Well I won't tell you, even if you ask!|
97075|#821$#Regardless, Hermes will definitely go out tonight, and every other night for that matter!
#822$#That's because he has to go and do his patrols.|
97076|How are weapons usually maintained?|
97077|#821$#If you use them in battle often enough,
#822$#weapons will start to break down!|
97078|#821$#Hermes rubs some oil on his iron and steel weapons to make sure they're lubricated.|
97079|What do you like to eat for breakfast?|
97080|#821$#I stay out late at night on patrol, so I often skip breakfast.|
97081|#822$#Hermes will eat anything except chicken!
#821$#Ugh...just thinking about cooking books sends a chill up my spine. |
97082|The way to deal with your enemies...|
97083|#823$#Well, what I like to do is just walk up and smack them in the mouth!|
97084|#823$#What? The enemies have been spotted?
#824$#Fear not! Hermes will protect you!|
97085|Do you have any hobbies?|
97086|#822$#Hobbies...Hermes likes to shoot the breeze with friends...
#821$#so he's up to speed on all the latest gossip. Do you want some info?
#821$#Hermes will tell you, but it has to stay our little secret...|
97087|#821$#Hermes loves to exercise!
#822$#Look at this stunning figure! It's quite obviously I spend a lot of time in the gym, right?
#821$#Hey! Hey! Hey!|
97088|Have you heard of the Silent Ice Field?|
97089|#823$#Ha! I know! I know!
#821$#Hermes once saw a beautiful fortress here!
#822$#It had high, high walls with walkways on top for surveillance.
#821$#However, there was no protective netting. I was afraid to walk along the walls, for fear I would fall... |
97090|#822$#I heard it snows there year round. 
#821$#Do you want to go?
#822$#Well...although it's cold, Hermes is still willing to go there with you.|
97091|Where do you usually go?|
97092|#823$#Hermes' favorite place is the City of Navea. I love to go window-shopping there!
#821$#There are many enemies within the Navea, but there are also many merchants from around the world!
#822$#Every time I go there, I can't resist the urge to "borrow" a few trinkets.|
97093|#821$#To the City of Navea!
#823$#I usually go with my brother to the Navea to watch the Vanguard Soldiers train.|
97094|About the Tanukis...|
97095|#823$#Tanuki! The Tanukis are so cute!
#821$#They have furry tails and round bodies!
#822$#Plus, their fur is multi-colored!|
97096|#821$#Once I saw the Tanukis protecting their stashes of corn.
#822$#The corn they had gathered was gigantic!|
97097|Related to fishing|
97098|#821$#Just grab a fishing pole and find some bait, and you can start fishing!
#822$#You'll be able to catch different fish in different locations.
#821$#If I remember correctly, you may even be able to catch Tortoises. |
97099|#822$#I think there's a fishing family.
#821$#They offer fishing classes to interested students.
#822$#Go to the beach, and you should be able to track down their whereabouts.|
97100|Concerning the Dimensional Fissure and Dimensional Hall|
97101|#822$#Demons from the Otherworld will often emerge from the rift.
#821$#However, with Hermes' help,
#823$#we'll beat back all those demons!|
97102|#821$#The Dimensional Fissure extends throughout this entire world.
#824$#The demons that emerge from within hail from another world.
#821$#However, you need to find the other two people in order to enter the crack.
#823$#Of course, Hermes will accompany you on this Quest as well...|
97103|About humans.|
97104|#821$#Hermes thinks you humans are all very interesting...
#822$#That's why I keep making new things to share with you!
#821$#Recently, Hermes made a new Lyre.
#823$#I'll teach you guys how to make fire from wood!|
97105|#822$#Humans are very friendly, but they have enemies...
#824$#but never fear. Hermes will protect you!|
97106|Why am I serving as the messenger of the Gods?|
97107|#823$#Because Hermes runs really, really fast!
#821$#Everyone knows I complete tasks quicker than anyone, and I always complete the entire mission!|
97108|#823$#Even my dad says I run the fastest
#821$#, so he made me a messenger!
#823$#The Boss thinks so too!|
97109|How do I move so fast?|
97110|#822$#Hehe...have you figured it out?
#821$#Hermes' shoes are specially made.
#822$#That's why he's as quick as lightning!|
97111|#821$#Hermes is the child of thunder,
#824$#so he moves at a crazy speed!|
97112|Can you talk about your family?|
97113|#823$#Hermes' Boss loves him so much!
#822$#He's handsome, charming and oh so gentle!
#823$#He lends me his helmet and lets me watch the iron throne!
#821$#That's why my Boss is the king of Pandemonium!|
97114|#821$#My brother frowns every day.
#825$#Maybe that's because he's always fighting with my big sister.|
97115|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97116|#825$#It seems like Aunt Tanith hates Hermes...
#821$#But Hermes is not sad!
#822$#Hermes is happy as long as you're here!|
97117|#823$#A few days ago, the villagers gave me this bottle of wine!
#822$#It smells great, but how does it taste?|
97118|Why am I able to freely enter and leave the Pandemonium?|
97119|#823$#Because my Boss misses me!
#822$#Only Hermes has been granted permission to come meet my Boss at my own discretion.|
97120|#821$#I often help the Boss take souls back to the Pandemonium.
#823$#That's why I can come and go at will.|
97121|How can I defeat Argus Panoptes?|
97122|#823$#That's easy. All you have to do is sing a song for him!
#821$#Hermes can teach you how to sing Argus Panoptes' favorite song!|
97123|#825$#He has a hundred eyes, so you and Hermes must be as quick as lightning!
#821$#That's the only way you'll escape his gaze!|
97124|What are you using to fly?|
97125|#821$#I used to just use the wings on my feet.
#822$#Lately I've discovered that elves move even faster!
#821$#That's why I now wear special shoes and am using the power of lightning to fly!|
97126|#821$#When Hermes uses the power of thunder, he moves even faster!
#823$#I move so fast, that it looks like I'm flying. Hey! HEY!|
97127|Why does Aelius get mad every time he sees you?|
97128|#821$#Brother Aelius is not angry.
#822$#This is the game I play with Brother Aelius every day.
#821$#He's just...tired of losing to Hermes...hehe!|
97129|#822$#That's because Hermes is always lending things to Aelius, no?
#821$#Ah...Hermes does not know.|
97130|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97131|#825$#Hermes doesn't like you speaking that way!
#821$#We will be together forever
#822$#and never be separated!|
97132|#825$#Hermes really likes you... 
#821$#How could you ask such a question? |
97133|Do you prefer day or night?|
97134|#821$#Hm? I just love the night!
#822$#So many sleepy people to feast on...|
97135|#821$#Hm? The stars are so beautiful at night.
#822$#It's the perfect setting to move through people's dreams.|
97136|Do you have any hobbies?|
97137|#821$#Errr...ahhh...::yawn::
#822$#I just love... Sleeping...
#821$#What? Now... It's time to drift off... Shhh...|
97138|#821$#Hm? I just love sleeping...
#822$#You look so comfy...Do you want to cuddle up next to me?
#821$#Huh? Why is your face red? Sleep...sleepy sleep sleep...::yawn::|
97139|Do you have any hobbies?|
97140|#821$#Hm? I love watching people from afar.
#822$#It's the best when someone is annoyed.
#822$#Look! That person's dress is so long, let's step on it!|
97141|#822$#If I'm not in people's dreams, I like to wander around the town.
#821$#Hm? I haven't found anything interesting lately though...|
97142|Is there someone you like?|
97143|#822$#Hehe, I love sleeping people...
#821$#The longer people sleep, the more I like them...|
97144|#821$#I've had a crush lately, hehe.
#822$#They're around all the time and so powerful...
#821$#Am I being too obvious? You really don't know?|
97145|Are there things that you hate?|
97146|#821$#Hm? I hate being bored.
#822$#You should find something fun to do with me.|
97147|#821$#Hm? Things I hate?
#821$#Hm? I can't stand having my sleep disturbed.
#824$#That's definitely no fun!|
97148|Have you been to Secret Forest Lake?|
97149|#822$#It's a huge crystal-clear lake.
#821$#Calm water, quiet all around... It makes me so sleepy...|
97150|#822$#The dense forest makes it nice and shady.
#821$#It's cool and calm there... Nothing beats it for sleeping. Hm... Shhh...|
97151|Have you heard of the Hidden Valley?|
97152|#822$#It's a huge valley hidden by mist.
#821$#I've heard there are mysterious people guarding it. I wonder if their dreams are fun...|
97153|#822$#There's also a huge graveyard with lots of people sleeping there...
#821$#Hm? Such a shame I can't get into their dreams.|
97154|Demon sightings have increased recently.|
97155|#821$#Hah, don't wake me for such weak demons.
#822$#Oh? Well, there is one thing. High-order demons must come through this exclusive summoning array~|
97156|#821$#I'm very good at dealing with demons.
#822$#Don't worry, I'll keep them away from you.|
97157|About the Eternal Codex.|
97158|#821$#Ooh, is that a book of your memories?
#822$#Does it have dreams in it too? It would be nice to play in peoples memories and not just dreams.|
97159|#821$#I don't have many of my own memories...
#821$#I sleep all day, it makes me feel complete... Shhh...|
97160|Transmitting Information.|
97161|#821$#Letters? Bah! That's so boring! How is that fun?|
97162|#821$#What? Do you want to write to me?
#822$#Hm? I don't like to read letters, too many words.
#821$#You can just tell me directly, and I can drift off to sleep.|
97163|Why do I always meet you in my dreams?|
97164|#821$#::Yawn:: How should I know?
#822$#You miss me? Is that why you keep dreaming of me?|
97165|#821$#Hm? Did I play in your dreams? As for you, what dreams do you have?
#822$#Oh? Did you wake up tired? ::Yawn:: I don't know nuthin.|
97166|Your horn is quite special.|
97167|#821$#Oh? Is my horn showing again?
#824$#Oh... Please don't stare at it... I feel like it's bigger now...|
97168|#824$#Oh... Don't look at my horn... How... charming!
#821$# Oh? You think it's beautiful? Really?|
97169|Sleep...is it important to you?|
97170|#821$#Man, oh man. Shh...
#821$#Hm? What? Well, if you have something to say, don't mutter about it!|
97171|#822$#Don't you know, sleeping well is the key to beauty.
#821$#It's important for me to stay beautiful so I can keep you interested!|
97172|Where are you from?|
97173|#821$#A dark, terrible place filled with scary creatures...
#822$#Can you guess where? Hehe, of course it's Pandemonium!
#821$#I was never able to sleep well there. Hm? Terra is the best though!|
97174|#821$#Hmm...::Yawn:: I'm from the demon realm.
#822$#It's difficult to get back there...
#821$#Do you want to go check it out? ::Yawn:: Then you need to become a demon first.|
97175|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97176|#821$#Hm? I always see Pandora with Dante...
#822$#I know the secret of Pandora's eyes.
#821$#Do you want to know too? ::Yawn:: I'll tell you about it after I wake up.|
97177|#821$#I've heard that Demeter and Hades hate each other.
#821$#They're never seen together, hah!|
97178|Are you a demon?|
97179|#821$#Hm? Can't you tell? I'm a special demon.
#822$#What's wrong? Look at you, I wouldn't eat you...|
97180|#821$#::Yawn:: You interrupted my sleep to ask about this nonsense?
#822$#Look at me, what am I if not a Demon?|
97181|Something from your sweetest dreams?|
97182|#821$#The happiest dream I've had... I dreamed about sleeping forever... Shhh...|
97183|#821$#::Yawn:: What I love the most is frolicking with you in my dreams...
#822$#Let's never wake up...|
97184|You are beautiful.|
97185|#821$#You're so sweet.
#822$#I'll be even more beautiful in the dream... Do you want to see?|
97186|#822$#Do you like my hair?
#821$#It's puffy and soft, just like a pillow. Shhh...|
97187|Are dreams important to you?|
97188|#821$# Hm? Hm... Of course they're important to me.
#821$#When everyone is asleep and dreaming... I can just... I can just... Shh... Shhh...|
97189|#821$#Hm? I love when others dream.
#822$#So... I can feast for days!
#821$#... How? Hm? You'll see when you fall asleep...|
97190|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97191|#824$#... I don't want to talk right now.
#821$#Hm? Once I wake up... I'll just pretend this didn't happen.|
97192|#821$#Hm? We will never be apart in our dreams...
#822$#Hehe, then just keep sleeping.|
97193|What's your favorite type of music?|
97194|#821$#I don't have a favorite type, but there are some that I hate...
#822$#The beautiful harp though... Just thinking about it makes me sleepy...
#824$#No! I can't sleep now! I have to guard the gate to Pandemonium!|
97195|#821$#I like to listen to the sounds from Pandemonium while I guard it.
#822$#A low soothing voice singing is my favorite.|
97196|What's your favorite food?|
97197|#823$#Honey cookies! Whenever a devil comes to Pandemonium they bring some for me!
#824$#It's not a bribe, it's just a treat!|
97198|#821$#Definitely honey cookies!
#822$#But... One time someone put sleeping pills in them...
#824$#I fell asleep while guarding the gate! Luckily Boss didn't get mad at me...|
97199|Is there someone you like?|
97200|#821$#A crush?
#822$#My brothers and I have never left the gate, how would we meet anyone?
#821$#My brothers and I have each other.|
97201|#821$#A crush? I've never thought about it...
#823$#If I had to choose... It would be someone responsible and handsome!|
97202|Do you want to go for a walk?|
97203|#824$#... You don't think we're pets, right?
#824$#What? Green Flame! Purple Flame! Don't get so excited!|
97204|#823$#Really? Let's go! Green Flame and Purple Flame are ready!
#821$# What happened? Are you happy to see us?|
97205|Is there anything that's troubling you?|
97206|#821$#The Devil is starting to suspect that Purple Flame is too cute...
#824$#If this goes on too much longer... No one would fear the guardian of Pandemonium.|
97207|#822$#Sigh... Green Flame can't control himself when we talk to the Boss.
#821$#He always tries to bite his wings.
#824$#The Boss just looks at us with those horrible cold eyes...|
97208|Have you been to Obscura Tree Cave?|
97209|#821$#It just looks like a hole in the tree from the outside. I didn't know there was something inside it!
#822$#If there's an ancient relic there must be a lot of stories about it!|
97210|#821$#It's a forest that's constantly surrounded by darkness.
#822$#It feels just like Pandemonium, I wonder if Boss would like it.|
97211|Have you heard of Obscura Canyon Shrine?|
97212|#821$#I don't like the area, but the huge structure feels like the palace.
#822$#Do you think the same people built it?|
97213|#821$#The Church Devil said it's been a holy place for a long time.
#822$#It means as much to them as Pandemonium means to me!|
97214|Do you know about Terra?|
97215|#821$#Boss said there are abandoned Devils in the Ghostweep Cave in Terra.
#823$#Ha, gotcha! It's Hermes' fault!|
97216|#821$#I've always wanted to see the Shattered Netherworld. I've heard the gate to Pandemonium is there.
#822$#I wonder if there are guards there.|
97217|Do you even know how to fish?|
97218|#821$#Fish? I think meat tastes better.
#822$#Green Flame thinks so too.|
97219|#821$#I have fished in the Styx, it's easier to catch fish there than in Terra.
#822$#All the fish were skeletons, but Green Flame liked them anyway!|
97220|About the Eidolons' Oath.|
97221|#821$#This is an oath, right?
#822$#Only people with a strong bond could fulfill an oath like that.
#821$#Do you think we could do that someday?|
97222|#821$#An oath is an unbreakable promise.
#822$#It's like how I promised to guard Pandemonium.
#821$#Do you think you could keep a promise like that?|
97223|Do you really have three heads?|
97224|#821$#Haha, that's just a story humans made up.
#822$#They must have just seen Green Flame and Purple Flame climbing on my back.|
97225|#823$#Three heads... That would look pretty good!
#821$#Purple Flame!
#822$#Green Flame!
#823$#Let's combine!|
97226|Do you work in Pandemonium?|
97227|#821$#Right! As long as we guard it, no one dares try to get into Pandemonium.
#824$#... Someone entered Pandemonium while still alive? Ha! That... That must have been an accident!|
97228|#821$#Our job is to defend the entrance to Pandemonium.
#822$#The souls of the dead aren't allowed to leave.
#821$#... Is there someone you want to meet?|
97229|Can you introduce me to your brother?|
97230|#822$#Green Flame can really eat, he devours piles of meat every day!
#823$#My brother is amazing! The more you eat, the stronger you get!
#822$#What? You can't tell us apart? Green Flame has an awesome green tattoo!|
97231|#821$#Purple Flame loves to act cute. He gets so happy when you rub his tummy.
#823$#Look! Isn't my brother the cutest?|
97232|You've been to Terra?|
97233|#824$#Gigas brought me to Terra, then back to Pandemonium!
#824$#I was careless, it won't happen again!
#824$#That guy was so weird...|
97234|#821$#Boss told Gigas to take me to Terra.
#822$#He must have had his reasons...
#824$#Sad? Of course I wasn't! Whatever Boss says is always the right thing!|
97235|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97236|#821$#Hermes is always looking for the Boss in Pandemonium.
#824$#She's so noisy, she constantly disturbs the Boss while he's working!
#824$#I'll never be as disloyal as her!|
97237|#821$#Boss hates spring in Terra, it has something to do with Demeter.
#822$#If I could I would keep Terra in winter forever...
#821$#Who is the Boss? You don't know about Hades from Pandemonium?|
97238|What do you think about Hades?|
97239|#823$#He's the most magnificent thing in the world.
#824$#I would never let anything happen to him, ever.|
97240|#823$#Handsome, strong, solemn, irreplaceable.
#823$#That's what the Boss is to me.|
97241|Do you hate Hermes?|
97242|#821$# That's rather direct...
#822$#I don't think I hate her.
#824$#She just bugs the Boss so much!|
97243|#821$#Hermes? What makes you bring her up?
#822$#Wow... It's been a while since I've seen her...
#824$#I hope she isn't bothering the Boss while I'm gone!|
97244|Your brothers seem like good companions.|
97245|#821$#We've been together our whole lives.
#822$#I can't even imagine what it would be like without them.
#823$#Why do you look jealous? You're our brother too!|
97246|#821$#My brothers love being by my side.
#822$#Green Flame loves eating, and Purple Flame loves to play.
#823$#A reliable brother? Oh really?|
97247|Do you like to feel needed?|
97248|#821$#Being needed feels like an honor.
#823$#If master needs me, I'll be there in a flash.|
97249|#821$#I used to think that guarding Pandemonium
#822$#and being needed by the Boss and my brothers was all there was.
#823$#But since I've met you, I can see there's even more to life!|
97250|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97251|#822$#... Did we do something wrong?
#821$#Kidding? You... I almost started crying...|
97252|#821$#Even if you decided to leave, we wouldn't forget you.
#823$#You'll always be our master, no matter what.|
97253|Something that's incredible?|
97254|#822$#There are so many races on earth!
#821$#Races that are tiny, tall, old...
#822$#...Growing up? The human body will change with time??|
97255|#821$#Idun comes to earth sometimes to play.
#822$#Every time Idun comes here, the people in each family have changed.
#821$#Do humans like moving around?|
97256|Do you like animals?|
97257|#823$#Idun loves the sheep in the orchard!
#822$#The little sheep will help me harvest apples and play with me!
#823$#Idun's little sheep is the cutest!|
97258|#821$#One sheep, two sheep, three sheep!
#822$#Four sheep, five sheep, six sheep...
#824$#seven sheep, seven...zzzz...Idun loves the sheep in the orchard...|
97259|What's your favorite food?|
97260|#823$#Idun loves apples!
#822$#There is nothing in this world more delicious than apples.
#821$#Are there any delicious apples here?|
97261|#821$#Idun loves the Golden fruits growing on the trees best!
#823$#You know what I mean, right? Juicy, fragrant apples!
#822$#Apples are red? The apples that Idun's been eating are Gold!|
97262|Changing seasons?|
97263|#821$#Idun loves autumn the most.
#823$#It's the season to harvest bucketfuls of apples!
#822$#Autumn is the season of apples.|
97264|#821$#Idun loves all the seasons.
#822$#Different temperatures and moistures result in different types of apples!|
97265|Are there things that you fear?|
97266|#822$#Eagles are scary! Their sharp talons and scary eyes...
#824$#I saw Ruffles beside Yumikaze...It was so scary I ran away!|
97267|#822$#When I was carried off by bad guys, I they whooshed me up into the air...
#824$#The ground became so tiny, I went up so high...! Sniff... Idun feels like throwing up...|
97268|Something troublesome?|
97269|#821$#Everyone on earth wants a taste of the Golden Apple,
#822$#so why don't the gods give it to them?
#821$#They're so sweet that they should be shared with everyone!|
97270|#823$#Did you hear? Idun's Golden Apples are so delicious that they've become famous!
#822$#Idun has been warned by the gods that they are only for gods...
#821$#Why can't everyone have this taste sensation? Don't you think the gods are being stingy?|
97271|Do you know about the locations in the human world?|
97272|#821$#Idun would like to visit the Helonia Coast!
#822$#A person named Bella there has an orchard with lots of apple trees!
#823$#I'm sure we will get along well!|
97273|#821$#I've heard that Navea is the biggest city in the human world.
#822$#All sorts of races trade there daily.
#823$#Heehee! I'll be able to find special apples there!|
97274|What do you know about the Quests?|
97275|#821$#I know that if there's an exclamation mark on the map, someone needs help!
#823$#Let's go help them out!|
97276|#821$#I've heard there's a secret organization called the Mirabelle Association...
#822$#They offer all types of quests to strengthen your abilities.
#823$#I wonder what they have right now? Let's go see!|
97277|Can you tell me about Sanctuaries?|
97278|#821$#There's lots you can do in the Sanctuary: planting, mining, fishing...
#823$#Should I manage your orchard for you? Great! Idun loves growing fruit trees.|
97279|#823$#There's a large plot of land perfect for growing trees, Idun will grow some shiny golden apples for you!
#822$#Huh? The soil here is different from the soil in my hometown.
#824$#Hmm, I wonder if it's any good...|
97280|About the Eternal Codex.|
97281|#821$#I hear it's a book with a lot of stories.
#822$#It fills up as you gather experience!
#823$#Idun has many stories too! So many possibilities... Where are Idun's??|
97282|#821$#Idun has heard it's a book that lets you see the past.
#822$#Let me think...Ah! I'd like to witness the birth of the first Golden Apple!
#824$#Hmm? Why can't I see it? Is this book broken?|
97283|What's a Golden Apple?|
97284|#821$#Golden Apples are magical fruits grown by me!
#822$#You'll have eternal youth if you eat one.
#824$#Do you want to try it? But the gods have warned Idun that they are meant for gods only...|
97285|#821$#The harvested Golden Apples can only get magic powers after Idun touches them!
#822$#Normal red apples? ...Idun will try them... Hmm...!
#824$#Hmm? Nothing has changed. Well...I'm not lying!|
97286|Do you want to grow up?|
97287|#821$#What do you mean "grow up"? Can you tell me about it?
#822$#Growing taller, changing your looks, and then becoming wrinkly and old?
#821$#Idun thought the people with different ages were from different races altogether!|
97288|#821$#Yes, Idun wants that! But what is growing up?
#823$#If only it's as sweet as apples.
#824$#What? Growing up is like a bitter and sour fruit?? Hmm, then I don't want any.|
97289|Are you important to the gods?|
97290|#822$#Well, Golden Apples are important to the gods, and they belong to Idun...
#823$#So Idun is important to the gods!|
97291|#821$#Once when I was captured by baddies, the gods were in a panic and rescued me immediately!
#822$#They only realized that I was missing when they started aging...
#821$#Hmm, am I important then?|
97292|Sounds like you're easy to capture.|
97293|#821$#Idun is really careful, I won't be tricked.
#823$#Huh? There's a new type of apple? Ohhh, show me immediately!|
97294|#821$#You only think like that because of what happened.
#822$#Idun wouldn't have been tricked if those baddies hadn't used Idun's favourite apples!
#824$#Didn't hear me? Hmm... well then forget everything I've said!|
97295|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97296|#822$#There were three girls who fought over a Golden Apple.
#821$#A different Golden Apple, not like the ones I have.
#822$#Can you guess who it was? I shouldn't say... but it was Tanith, Astraea, and Venus!|
97297|#821$#Lumikki loves apples too!
#822$#Though she has some trauma around the red ones...
#823$#But Lumikki will love my Golden Apples!
#824$#Oh! I've nearly forgotten...The Golden Apples must not be given away...|
97298|Can you tell me about your weapon?|
97299|#821$#My weapon is called Eternity!
#823$#It has powerful magic that can keep you young forever.
#822$#Do you see the apple up there? It's the first Golden Apple that was harvested.|
97300|#821$#Huh? You mean Eternity?
#822$#It's always in my hands.
#821$#It grows bigger as time passes, just like a tree.
#824$#I wonder, will it be too big for Idun to lift someday?|
97301|Do you have an orchard?|
97302|#821$#Idun's orchard is huge! You'll get lost the first time you go in.
#822$#There's a flock of soft, woolly sheep that belongs to me...
#824$#I'm thinking of my flock of sheep now...|
97303|#821$#It's gold everywhere in Idun's orchard, every tree is shining brightly!
#823$#My trees bear Golden Apples.
#822$#There are three beautiful ladies too...|
97304|Your clothes are so cute.|
97305|#821$#They're loose and fluffy, and really comfy!
#823$#They're made by the tailor sheep in the orchard, aren't they great?
#822$#Do you want an outfit like this? Once the sheep shed their wool, you can get one!|
97306|#821$#Everything I wear was made by sheep.
#822$#I'll have to tell them when I go back.
#823$#They'll be delighted to hear their clothes are a big hit!|
97307|Your ears are so special.|
97308|#821$#Idun's ears are just like sheep ears!
#822$#Heehee, that tickles! Stop touching them!|
97309|#821$#My ears are like sheep ears.
#823$#It's so warm in the winter, I never freeze!|
97310|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97311|#821$#If we split up, you have to bring me back to my hometown...
#824$#Idun's hometown is somewhere really high up. But I'm afraid of heights...
#823$#Huh? You can't reach it? Then we must never part!|
97312|#821$#Why would we ever split up? You mean because humans wrinkle and crumple and die?
#823$#You just have to eat Idun's Golden Apples!
#822$#Their special powers will help you! Shhh, don't tell anyone else.|
97313|What do you normally eat?|
97314|#822$#The despair of dead souls is absolutely delicious.
#821$#Are you joking? I have no time for this.|
97315|#821$#Darkness and despair taste so good.|
97316|Tell me about things that you hate.|
97317|#821$#Eagles and squirrels deserve every bad thing that happens to them.
#824$#I would like to chase them off the edges of the world.|
97318|#821$#Weaklings are the most useless things in this world.
#822$#The world only needs the strong.|
97319|Tell me the best strategy for facing a powerful enemy.|
97320|#821$#I love strong opponents! Only strong warriors may stand before me.|
97321|#821$#Strong opponents? I love crushing them under my feet.
#822$#It's hilarious to see their egos destroyed along with their skulls.|
97322|Have you ever felt lonely?|
97323|#821$#The strong are always lonely...
#822$#Don't be silly! I don't know what that means.|
97324|#821$#Loneliness? I allow no such weakness in my life.|
97325|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
97326|#821$#I only care for the strong.|
97327|#821$#You're not strong enough yet.
#822$#You're not worth lifting my finger against.|
97328|Are you a good fighter?|
97329|#821$#Are you trying to provoke me?
#822$#Hahaha! I accept your challenge, pick up your weapon!|
97330|#821$#Prepare for some terrible knowledge! I'll show you what a strong person can really do.|
97331|Have you been to Secret Forest Lake?|
97332|#821$#It's just a bunch of trees, what's so special about it?|
97333|#821$#...You think I'll eat it just because it's a tree?
#824$#I don't like low quality trees. Watch it with this stuff. I might just eat up your world.|
97334|Have you heard of the Hidden Valley?|
97335|#821$#It's your world. You probably know more than me, no?|
97336|#822$#There's a large cemetery there, great for eternal rest, no?|
97337|About the Eternal Codex.|
97338|#821$#...Memories? Why should strong people bother remembering things?|
97339|#822$#Isn't that what humans use to remember events? How pathetic.|
97340|Do you know what the Holy vs Evil Showdown is?|
97341|#821$#A duel? Why bother? No one can defeat me.
#822$#No matter if they're Evil or Holy, I can slice them all up.|
97342|#821$#The strong all gather on the battlefield. Doesn't it just fill you with anticipation?
#822$#A strong warrior that falls is no better than a weakling.|
97343|Is the World Tree delicious?|
97344|#822$#A giant World Tree sounds like it could satisfy my appetite.
#823$#I'm excited! It must be delicious to gnaw on the root of the world!|
97345|#822$#Do you want to try it? Not a chance! I'm messing with you. You're not strong enough.|
97346|Do you like to eat?|
97347|#821$#Are you trying to get some food?
#822$#...You call this food? It's not enough to satisfy me.|
97348|#821$#Your news travels fast! I want to eat everything.
#822$#I just want to gobble up these weaklings, they disgust me!|
97349|Are you a dragon?|
97350|#821$#Yes, an evil dragon that devours everything! At least, that's what they call me.|
97351|#822$#I am the dark dragon that swallows the world, I am the symbol of power itself.
#821$#Is there another one of you somewhere? I think there is one.|
97352|You can cause calamities?|
97353|#821$#Are you scared now? Hahaha! Everyone should quake!
#822$#When the world collapses into havoc, we'll see how strong you are.|
97354|#821$#The best way to get rid of weaklings is to make loud noises.
#822$#You can make a lot of loud noises by destroying the world.|
97355|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97356|#821$#Verdandi thinks that she can protect the World Tree with her puny sisters?
#822$#I will devour their feeble hopes, you'll see.|
97357|#822$#Ayako was once as strong as me, devouring everything.
#821$#Hmph, it's done for now.|
97358|Can you tell me about your weapon?|
97359|#821$#Are you talking about Despair? It's a weapon of wonderful terror.
#823$#It slices idiots in half and weaklings in thirds! Hahaha!|
97360|#821$#The Scythe of Death takes everyone's life eventually.
#822$#But Despair kills fools and weaklings right away!|
97361|Where are you from?|
97362|#821$#Who cares?|
97363|#821$#You'll never reach the third root of the world tree.
#822$#I'll smash to pieces this world of weaklings!|
97364|What about the Twilight of the Gods?|
97365|#821$#When all the gods die? Can't wait! I've got snacks packed!|
97366|#822$#But that Twilight is taking forever to arrive!
#823$#The gods won't care if I kill all the weaklings first! Hahaha!|
97367|Do you have friends?|
97368|#821$#Friends are for the weak. Friendship clumps people in groups, making them easier to kill.|
97369|#822$#Friends? Who needs 'em? A true warrior's only friends are Strength and Power.|
97370|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97371|#821$#Are you kidding, shrimp? I could crush you by sneezing.
#822$#You aren't going anywhere unless I say so.|
97372|#821$#Split up? You looking to end your life?
#822$#The only way we split up is when you die.|
97373|Do you believe in Santa Claus?|
97374|#821$#Lame...
#824$#How old are you? You still believe in things like that?|
97375|#821$#You have such great power,
#824$#yet you believe in fairy tales?|
97376|Do you like Christmas?|
97377|#822$#It was just invented by human businesses to make a quick buck...
#821$#What, you really like it?|
97378|#821$#As the Heroic Glory, I have no time for fun!
#822$#Get your head out of the clouds! Go back to your training!|
97379|Christmas dinner menu|
97380|#821$#Hmm, I received a Christmas Dinner recipe book a few days ago...
#822$#I think Ayako is really looking forward to it...
#821$#Let's take a look...|
97381|#821$#A strong hero doesn't succumb to gluttony.
#822$#With the right nutrition, people grow taller, so...
#821$#Wait, I can hear you laughing!|
97382|Did you write any Christmas Cards?|
97383|#821$#Are you talking about those mass-produced cards?
#822$#Hmph! My cards should bear the insignia of my clan...
#823$#It's an honour to receive a letter from the Heroic Glory, not just anyone gets a letter!|
97384|#821$#...Take it.
#822$#What kind of saying is that?
#821$#Give it back if you don't want it!|
97385|Let's sing "Silent Night" together!|
97386|#822$#Silent Night? I haven't heard of it.
#821$#What are you looking at...
#823$Getting stronger is much more important than singing!|
97387|#821$#Look for Aelius if you want to sing.
#823$#All I care about is strengthening my abilities.|
97388|Let's get a Christmas Tree!|
97389|#821$#...Are you really that interested in this festival?
#822$#Alright, let's go find a Christmas Tree.
#821$#In my opinion we need a noble and elegant Christmas Tree...|
97390|#824$#Why do you waste your time on things that are so unimportant...
#821$#What? You said Ayako is very interested... What does that have to do with me?!
#822$#Let's go! You first!|
97391|Your scent changed?|
97392|#821$#You mean the freshly baked gingerbread men?
#822$#Why is it here? Hmm...
#821$#What's the point of asking? Just eat it if you want it!|
97393|#821$#Have you been infected by that fella...
#822$#Your nose is as sharp as hers...
#821$#Huh? You heard wrong, I didn't mention anyone!|
97394|Let's enjoy Christmas in the city!|
97395|#821$#Navea, the center of trade and culture...
#822$#Fine, I need to get some training supplies anyway...
#821$#Why do you look so calm? It's important to strengthen yourself!|
97396|#821$#When we get back, promise you'll duel with me for training!
#822$#Don't be lazy just because it's a festival!|
97397|Should we look at different Christmas places?|
97398|#821$#People who need help have a blue exclamation mark on the map.
#822$#Don't forget to look for exclamation marks on the map while you're out and about!|
97399|#821$#You still have to help others, even at a festival!
#822$#This is a part of training, it doesn't stop even during a festival.
#821$#Don't be lazy! Check out the blue exclamation mark on the Map!|
97400|Auction?|
97401|#821$#Definitely, the auction site is a great place for presents.
#822$#Don't you think it's more important to get a thoughtful gift than an expensive one?|
97402|#821$#My clan is a noble political force...
#822$#I'm not interested in the items at the auction site!
#821$#What matters to me is a thoughtful gift.|
97403|What a cute look.|
97404|#821$#What are you talking about!!
#822$#Listen up, I'm the Heroic Glory Tyr!
#824$#Call me heroic adjectives only!|
97405|#822$#They said this outfit makes me look more delicious...and sharp!
#821$#It's an outfit that suits the Heroic Glory...
#823$#Don't I look full of energy in this?|
97406|Had any Christmas experiences before?|
97407|#821$#Of course not!
#822$#Listen up, I'm the Heroic Glory Tyr!
#821$#Indulging in pleasure means trampling on the expectations of my father! I will not do such a thing!|
97408|#822$#Isn't it just a human celebration?
#821$#In the past... I only attended necessary banquets.
#823$#Power is the most important thing for Heroic Glory!|
97409|The color of the bandage?|
97410|#821$#...Do you want to find out why?
#822$#Not to be rude, but you seem way too interested in my arm...
#823$#If you care so much let's duel over it!|
97411|#821$#Since I have to change it anyway, it's better to change the whole set!
#822$#This fits the image of the Heroic Glory Tyr!|
97412|What do you want for Christmas?|
97413|#822$#Aren't gifts supposed to be a surprise on Terra?
#821$#How can you ask me straight out like that?|
97414|#823$#Let's fight on snowy grounds!
#821$#...Did you just roll your eyes?
#822$#Hmph! Isn't sharpening your battle skills a great gift?|
97415|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97416|#821$#Hmm, even they changed outfits during Christmas...
#822$#Red colors are vibrant and energetic, really suitable for a God of War.
#821$#Hmm? Nothing. I didn't say nothing. I mean anything.|
97417|#822$#Isn't this outfit great? It suits the Heroic Glory!
#821$#Huh? Bealdor's outfit?
#824$#Who cares how he looks?!|
97418|Celebrate Christmas Eve with your family?|
97419|#821$#Family...You mean my clan?
#822$#Even though it looks like we are one...
#821$#Clan members have their own lives to lead. We don't care much for Terra festivals.|
97420|#822$#I'll spend Christmas Eve with you this year.
#821$#I'm not saying you're my family!
#824$#Why are you smiling like that?|
97421|Have you helped Ayako to prepare a Christmas present?|
97422|#821$#Huh? Why do I have to help that fella prepare?
#824$#Hey! Stop checking my pockets!
#822$#No...These Gingerbread Men are only for fun!|
97423|#822$#A stocking filled with meat...
#821$#Stop staring! Do you want one too?|
97424|Christmas Sleigh?|
97425|#821$#You mean that contraption made of slapped-together wooden planks? How pathetic.
#822$#Hush now, let me invent a new ride for Santa Claus.
#821$#What? There's no need?|
97426|#821$#Hmm... not fast enough...
#822$#Don't mention Hermes. Even Ayako is faster.|
97427|Confirm the invitation list for the Christmas dinner.|
97428|#821$#Let's see, Bealdor?!
#821$#Why him, of all people?!
#824$#No, I refuse to be in the same room as him!|
97429|#821$#We need more roasted chicken and beef...
#822$#Actually, we need more of everything...
#824$#Wh..What!? For who?? You won't be able to finish it!|
97430|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97431|#824$#You're planning to part ways with the noble Heroic Glory?!
#821$#Do you want Santa Claus to be your partner?|
97432|#821$#Isn't Christmas a time for families and togetherness?
#822$#If we get split up, let's promise to reunite next Christmas!
#821$#It's only temporary, okay?|
97433|Do you believe in Santa Claus?|
97434|#822$#Of course!
#821$#A chubby old man in red...
#823$#He sure looks like a great hunk of meat!|
97435|#821$#Ayako is not too sure...
#822$#If you wish to know, Ayako will ask Jormungand!|
97436|Do you like Christmas?|
97437|#823$#Of course!
#822$#I can build delicious ice sculptures and then eat them...
#823$#Let's eat ice sculptures together!|
97438|#821$#Ayako loves Christmas presents!
#826$#Everyone gives presents to each other during Christmas, Ayako will receive tons of meat!
#822$#What about you, Master? Do you like Christmas?|
97439|Christmas feast?|
97440|#823$#Turkey is DELICIOUS!
#822$#I'd rather have roast beef.
#821$#Just like the little calf that the Hel raises!|
97441|#821$#Can I eat with Hel and Jormungand?
#823$#Awesome! Ayako wishes for a Christmas feast every day!|
97442|Do you want to send Christmas cards?|
97443|#821$#It's a hassle to write...
#822$#Why are you asking me this? Do you want a card from Ayako?
#823$#Alright, just for my Master! Time to get writing!|
97444|Can I write a lot of cards to Hel?#821$#
#822$#I can write one to the delicious lamb too, yummm! The card is all wet...
#824$#No, it's not my fault!|
97445|Let's sing "Silent Night" together.|
97446|#822$#Ayako has not sung before...
#823$#I would rather listen to cute Hel singing!
#822$#Don't you think it'll sound much better?|
97447|#822$#Alright!
#824$#Singing takes a lot of energy...
#825$#Singing makes me feel really hungry!|
97448|How to decorate the Christmas Tree?|
97449|#821$#Can we use anything?
#822$#Ayako wants to hang meat all over the Christmas Tree!
#823$#Hmm? What if they fall off? Ayako will gobble them all up!|
97450|#822$#Green tree...Doesn't look too yummy...
#826$#It'll be much more delicious with meat hanging off it!
#823$#Master, let's hang meat on the Christmas Tree!|
97451|Impressions of Christmas?|
97452|#821$#Santa Claus has a lot of strong reindeer!
#822$#But if Ayako eats the reindeer, Santa Claus won't be able to deliver any presents...
#823$#Ayako will try to control myself! For the meat presents!|
97453|#822$#Santa Claus will ride his sleigh and deliver presents everywhere!
#823$#The Holy City of Navea is so crowded, Santa Claus has to go there!
#824$#Ayako will never eat Santa Claus!|
97454|Do you want to go anywhere?|
97455|#821$#I've heard that you can see the whole starry sky somewhere in Triatio Highlands.
#823$#Maybe we can get closer to the soft and squishy Santa Claus there...
#824$#Ayako will never eat Santa Claus!|
97456|#821$#Ayako can't eat Santa Claus's Reindeers...
#822$#But we can eat the redwood forest deer on Starstruck Plateau!
#823$#Let's go, Master, onwards to Starstruck Plateau!|
97457|Can you introduce the Culinary Club?|
97458|#821$#Culinary Club? I wonder if they'll be cooking Christmas feasts... Ayako is hungry...
#824$#Gah! They only give out quests! Not meat!
#822$#Ayako will gobble them all up!|
97459|#822$#Ayako has heard that you might receive a pumpkin if you complete a quest given by the association...
#821$#Maybe Master should get some quests!
#824$#You'll add more food to our Christmas feast!|
97460|Housing?|
97461|#822$#That's Master's house!
#821$#You can put up Christmas decorations and make some meat!
#823$#Then you can invite Hel and Jormungand for a feast!|
97462|#821$#On Christmas Eve, Ayako wants to hang stockings over the fireplace.
#822$#When I wake up, the stockings will be filled with meat!|
97463|Your outfit is flashy.|
97464|#822$#Red looks delicious!
#823$#Wear it, Master! You'll look really delicious!
#825$#Master? Why are you backing away?|
97465|#822$#This new outfit makes me look amazingly!
#823$#Ayako loves new clothes!
#825$#Basically everything. What about Master? Do you like it when Ayako dresses up in new outfits?|
97466|Had any Christmas experiences before?|
97467|#821$#Isn't Christmas a festival on Terra?
#822$#Ayako has never celebrated Christmas before...
#823$#Ayako's first Christmas will be spent with Master!|
97468|#821$#Master Odin has given Ayako a lock!
#823$#This is a proof of affection for Ayako. Ayako gets a lot of food if I put it on!
#824$#It doesn't seem like a Christmas present...|
97469|Hel's Christmas dress?|
97470|#823$#Hel looks super adorable no matter what!
#824$#Hey! Master! What are you planning to do with Hel?
#822$#You have to go through Ayako if you want Hel! It doesn't matter if you're my Master or not!|
97471|#822$#Hel loves shining gold colors!
#821$#Are there golden Christmas outfits?
#823$#Even wearing an all-gold Christmas costume, Hel would still look beautiful!|
97472|"Christmas presents?|
97473|#821$#Without Gram, Hel has been depressed...
#822$#Maybe we should give Hel a servant?
#824$#Huh? Hel wouldn't want that? Why not?|
97474|#824$#Let's beat up whoever broke Hel's heart! Violence as a Christmas Present!
#822$#Huh? Hel wouldn't want that?
#821$#Why not... Hel is upset because of him, right?|
97475|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97476|#821$#The idiot who made Hel sad is always around the Pandemonium these days...
#821$#He holds a huge present in his hands...
#821$#No matter what, Ayako won't let him near Hel!|
97477|#821$#Gretel and Idun are cute little lambs!
#821$#They will make a good Christmas feast...
#821$#No! Ayako was just planning to invite them over! As a guest!|
97478|Celebrate Christmas with a family?|
97479|#821$#A whole family...?
#822$#Whenever I eat with Father and Jormungand...
#825$#They always want me to sit still...
#824$#Ayako has always been obedient...|
97480|#823$#Ayako loves eating with Hel!
#821$#When I see Hel, I'll think of mother...
#824$#Ayako misses mother now...|
97481|The lock on your neck...|
97482|#822$#It's a gift from Lord Odin!
#825$#Even if I change my clothes, I will keep it on!|
97483|#822$#It's a gift from Lord Odin! It goes really well with Ayako's outfit!
#823$#It's so shiny, Hel loves it too!
#825$#Hel always wants to touch Ayako's lock!|
97484|Christmas Sleigh?|
97485|#822$#It's Santa Claus's ride, he delivers presents in it!
#823$#A delicious combo that Ayako loves.
#824$#Ayako will never eat presents... Or Santa Claus!|
97486|#822$#Ayako can run way faster than a Christmas Sleigh!
#824$#Huh? Let Santa Claus ride on me? No way!|
97487|Invite Bealdor to have a Christmas dinner?|
97488|#821$#The idiot who broke Hel's heart?
#824$#No way!!!|
97489|#824$#That idiotic god!
#822$#Master, let's cook him for our Christmas feast!
#821$#I think we should hide this from Hel...|
97490|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97491|#821$#Split up? Did Ayako eat too fast?
#821$#Ayako left you some biscuits...
#821$#Master, don't part ways with Ayako!|
97492|#821$#Don't worry, Master!
#821$#Ayako has made a wish under the Christmas Tree.
#821$#We will never be apart!|
97493|You look sad sometimes.|
97494|#822$#I was just thinking about the past...
#821$#I don't want to talk about the past, so please don't ask me.|
97495|#822$# Oh? Sorry to worry you.
#821$#There's a wound deep inside me that will never heal.
#823$#Do you want to hear it? Thank you, but... maybe next time.|
97496|Do you prefer day or night?|
97497|#821$#While humans slumber, the moon shines in the clear sky...
#821$#That's my happiest memory from way back then.|
97498|#821$#In my captive days...
#824$#The only thing I pined for was a quiet night...
#821$#Oh, nothing. Ignore my mumbling.|
97499|Are there things that you fear?|
97500|#821$#A small space, incessant human voices...
#824$#I... I don't want to experience that again.|
97501|#821$#Were you trapped in a small cage?
#824$#I was shown off and exhibited, and never regained my freedom...|
97502|What's your most unforgettable experience?|
97503|#821$#I thought I could only hate humans, but you appeared...
#823$#You're different from other humans. I feel a warmth from you.|
97504|#821$#You who appeared in the wind...
#823$#Made my lonely heart beat with life again.|
97505|Do you like animals?|
97506|#821$#Spreading wings, riding the winds, soaring in the sky...
#822$#Don't you think birds in flight are the most beautiful animals of all?|
97507|#822$#Everything in this world exists for a reason.
#821$#But...I despise humans.|
97508|Humans...|
97509|#821$#Fear... I can't stop shaking with fear.
#822$#You? No...You're not the same.|
97510|#822$#There are good people and evil people in this world.
#821$#Yet it's so hard to tell them apart. Scary!
#822$#If I assume everyone is evil, I'll never get hurt...|
97511|Have you heard about Port Skandia?|
97512|#822$#I haven't heard of it, is it important?
#823$#Oh, your birthplace. Take me there next time.|
97513|#822$#I don't know, hmm? Is it your hometown?
#823$#A simple village and beautiful fishing port. Sounds nice.
#821$#My hometown...? I have no idea.|
97514|Where do you want to go to?|
97515|#821$#I've heard of Chronowood...
#823$#It's a quiet and beautiful forest, I really want to see it.
#821$#The skies there must be beautiful.|
97516|#821$#I watch the skies from a cage...
#822$#Hoping that one day I might fly in the endless sky...
#823$#Windwhisper Meadow? There's a large meadow and sky? Sounds like a beautiful place.|
97517|About the Eternal Codex.|
97518|#821$#A book that allows you to peer into the past.
#822$#My memories...? Trust me...You do not want to know.|
97519|#822$#Memories are just ripples that shimmer from the past. A book is an actual record of what happened.
#821$#Sometimes I do forget about the past... and everything...|
97520|About the Eidolons' Oath.|
97521|#821$#You can form a bind with someone you like.
#823$#But only if you both feel the same.|
97522|#822$#It's an oath for life, a bond of trust between you forever.
#821$#It's hard for me to trust anyone now...|
97523|Your name?|
97524|#823$#You're the first to ask this.
#821$#But...I can't tell you now...|
97525|#821$#The person who knows my name will have eternal happiness.
#823$#One day, you will know...|
97526|Your wings?|
97527|#821$#I had a pair of glorious wings once, but humans removed it by force...
#824$#The wounds on my back have healed, but the pain in my heart never fades...|
97528|#821$#My wings were removed by greedy humans a long time ago...
#824$#To stop me from escaping...
#821$#I remember the ripping pain on my back so vividly!|
97529|Your weapon is really special.|
97530|#822$#Oh? Its beautiful exterior hides pain within...
#821$#It's the last cage that humans used to trap me.|
97531|#821$#It's a cage of pain and sadness...
#822$#The bird inside is just a symbol of a heart that's trapped.
#821$#A wounded heart that cannot fly anymore...|
97532|You can bring happiness?|
97533|#821$#I bring happiness to humans, but sadness to myself.|
97534|#821$#I'm supposed to bring happiness, but humans just fight over me...
#822$#Did I really bring happiness?|
97535|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97536|#821$#Nidhogg wants to get rid of weak people and triggered a disaster.
#822$#Are humans weak? No, what am I thinking?|
97537|#821$#I've asked Lumikki what happiness means to her.
#823$#She wishes to marry a prince-charming-type and live happily ever after.
#821$#What a cute and simple kind of happiness.|
97538|What is happiness?|
97539|#821$#Some people think happiness comes from getting everything you want.
#822$#Some people think happiness is just having no worries.
#823$#What is happiness to you?|
97540|#821$#Chasing it and forgetting it's always right next to you.
#822$#Happiness is always right there for you. It's an unopened gift that you never noticed.|
97541|Your past.|
97542|#821$#I flew freely anywhere I wished, but then humans took my wings...
#824$#I've lost my freedom and myself...|
97543|#821$#Do you know? The sadness can be so painful it smothers every trace of happiness.
#824$#My past... all I remember is my sadness.|
97544|You're beautiful.|
97545|#822$#...
#821$#That's so sudden, what should I say?|
97546|#821$#Thank you.
#822$#If only the human heart was as easy to see as their faces.|
97547|Are you the messenger of happiness?|
97548|#821$#A blue feather hidden in a person and their home.
#822$#Feathers bring luck. I see happiness in people's eyes.
#821$#When did that change? All I see in humans is greed. Greed and nose hair.|
97549|#824$#This identity was the root of troubled times in my past...
#821$#It was all caused by humanity's greed...
#822$#...I'd rather be a bird without any worries.|
97550|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97551|#821$#It's strange and unfamiliar to be on my own, with no captor binding me.
#823$#You are a strange human.|
97552|#821$#If this is your wish, then so be it.
#823$#I wish for you to always be as happy as you are now.|
97553|What do you do to celebrate the festival?|
97554|#821$#Kabuto tends to drag me all over during special events.
#823$#Do you want to play a game too? The loser gets their face drawn on with ink!|
97555|#822$#I love a good feast with mountains of meat and tons of good wine!
#824$#Come on and raise your cup! Now, bottoms up!|
97556|Do you like celebrating the festival?|
97557|#821$#I woudn't say I particularly like or dislike it.
#823$#But if we celebrate together, maybe I'll think differently!|
97558|#822$#To be honest, I used to hate it, seeing families so happy together...
#824$#Gulp. Hahhh... It always felt like just another day to me.
#822$#But if it means drinking with a warrior like you, I don't find it half bad anymore!|
97559|Festival's Feast|
97560|#823$#You can't have a feast without good wine to complement the food!
#821$#Huh, no wine? But why?|
97561|#824$#Gulp, gulp... Bring me any fine wine and meat you have!
#822$#I want to taste them at the same time! Too delicious!|
97562|Did you send anyone a festival greeting card?|
97563|#825$#Greeting card? I've never sent one before...
#821$#Huh? Do you want an outfit like this? I'll prepare my brush and inkstone right away!
#823$#Let's see, what should I write?|
97564|#822$#Huh? I just want to make sure the card's a good one. Hold on a second.
#824$#Kabuto, come here! Don't run away, or I'll draw on your face with ink!
#822$#Here's a piece of paper with Kabuto's ink mark on it. Isn't it great?|
97565|Do you know any festival songs?|
97566|#823$#I recently heard the villagers singing one off in the distance.
#821$#Huh? Y-you want me to sing it? Now? No way! I'm not ready!|
97567|#822$#It has to be a festival song? Well, I might hum a bit if I feel it.
#824$#Urp! Oh, I got a song for you. It's called "Bring Me More Wine." Haha.|
97568|Got any preparations for the festival?|
97569|#821$#Well, Kabuto loves desserts, so we're going to needs tons of crackers!
#823$#Also some spider lilies to put around the house. They're so pretty when they bloom!
#821$#Huh? What's with the strange look? Was it something I said?|
97570|#824$#Hahaha! Burp. I want to decorate the whole house with wine jugs!
#822$#Yes, full ones! Then I can enjoy a sip in any corner of the house!|
97571|Any past impressions of the festival?|
97572|#821$#Every year I see people celebrating together in the village. They always look so happy.
#825$#I can't help but think how nice it'd be to hold a pair of warm hands, even if just for one day...
#823$#Huh? Kabuto? Eh, his hands are too cold and clammy.|
97573|#824$#Gulp, gulp. Anyway, seeing people gathering so happily is sort of irritating.
#822$#Back in our hometown, the festival had nothing to do with Kabuto and me.|
97574|Let's enjoy the festival in the city!|
97575|#821$#I don't normally like crowded places...
#823$#But if you're with me, I'll definitely go.|
97576|#822$#Huh? I absolutely hate crowded places.
#824$#Gulp, gulp. What's so fun about a bunch of noise and strangers?
#822$#Don't look at me like that... Fine, fine! I'll go with you!|
97577|Tell me about weapons.|
97578|#821$#Every weapon has its own hidden powers and can be enhanced to make it stronger.
#823$#You carry a very nice weapon with you, Master!|
97579|#824$#How can a warrior like you not know? Gulp!
#822$#Urp! Fine, I'll teach you, then! About enhancement...
#822$#Fortifying your weapon makes it stronger!|
97580|What's different now?|
97581|#821$#I sense the passage of time more deeply...
#823$#My bond with you has deepened as well.|
97582|#824$#Gulp, gulp! What sort of a question is that anyway?
#822$#Master... Urp! You've become stronger since we first met.|
97583|Your new outfit looks great!|
97584|#821$#You like it, Master? That's good.
#823$#I thought I'd switch things up a bit over the festival.|
97585|#822$#Gulp, gulp. Is that so? Look at Kabuto with all those crackers on his head! Haha! Hahaha!|
97586|What did you do for the festival in the past?|
97587|#821$#Before meeting you, I was covered in blood on the battlefield...
#825$#So I wasn't into festivals...
#823$#You want me to enjoy the festivities this year? Haha! You're so caring!|
97588|#824$#Urp! I used to fight on the battlefields. Festivals were out of the question!
#822$#Enough with these bothersome questions...|
97589|Anything you want for festival?|
97590|#821$#Why? Do you want to give me a present? There's nothing I really want.
#823$#My only wish is to follow you forever.|
97591|#822$#Burp! I already have everything I need! Well, except more wine.
#824$#If you still want to give me a present, bring me another jug!|
97592|Do you ever meet with family over the festival?|
97593|#825$#Family? I don't have any family... Kabuto has been my only companion for as long as I can remember.
#823$#I do feel like part of a family after meeting you though. Does that sound silly?|
97594|#824$#Gulp! What is a family anyhow? I've never had one, so I don't know.
#822$#Am I lonely? Nonsense! After all, I have you and Kabuto!|
97595|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97596|#821$#Elizabeth's aura is familiar...
#825$#It's the scent of blood, just like on the battlefields.|
97597|#824$#Verdandi and Nidhogg are like cat and dog.
#822$#Haha. I wonder who would win in a fight?|
97598|Kabuto looks really happy.|
97599|#821$#Does he now? He's been busy getting stuff together for the festival.
#823$#He's happy bustling about!|
97600|#822$#Kabuto... He's all excited over a simple festival. Burp!
#824$#Me, only wine makes me happy! Gulp, gulp!|
97601|Why does Kabuto look like that?|
97602|#823$#Hahaha! He was punished after losing at a game!
#821$#The loser had to get their face drawn on with ink!
#823$#Kabuto's really bad at games.|
97603|#822$#Urp! It's hilarious! Hahahaha!
#824$#Burp! Behold my masterpiece! Hahaha! Let's draw something on your face too!|
97604|Any hopes for the festival ahead?|
97605|#823$#Well, I wish to stay by your side forever.
#821$#And I hope my strength will aid you!|
97606|#822$#Huh? I only wish I stay beside the one I've acknowledged.
#824$#You're asking who? Urp. You already know, right?|
97607|I'll be counting on you!|
97608|#821$#Please continue to look out for me in the future, Master.
#823$#I'm honored to have met you.|
97609|#824$#Hmm? We're going to be seeing lots of each other in the festival?
#822$#Fine with me. I'm used to you.|
97610|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97611|#825$#Master! Is that what you've been thinking about this whole time?
#821$#Have I done something wrong...? Please let me know, Master.|
97612|#824$#Burp! I can't believe you've been thinking about such things.
#824$#Go, if that's what you secretly want. Kabuto and I will just have to capture you! Haha! Urp!|
97613|How do you kill time?|
97614|#821$#"Kill" time? What an...interesting choice of words.
#822$#For the sake of maintaining my beauty, I always make time for a soak with a drink in hand.
#823$#What's in the drink, you ask? It's a secret.|
97615|#821$#It's exhausting dealing with family affairs, attending banquets, keeping up my appearance, playing with maidens...
#822$#A commoner such as yourself can't possibly fathom the demands of life at court.|
97616|Is there anything you don't like?|
97617|#821$#Oh? Mining for information to use against me?
#822$#Ha. I don't fool so easily.|
97618|#821$#Are you perhaps dealing with something you don't like?
#823$#There, there, pet. Let me comfort you...|
97619|Is there anyone you have feelings for?|
97620|#821$#Until recently, only one thing interested me.
#822$#But now, the one I care for most...
#823$#Hmm, what's this?|
97621|#821$#Why are you moving away?
#823$#Don't you see? The one I care for most...|
97622|What do you know about the God of Battle?|
97623|#821$#Fighting is normally such a brutish endeavor.
#823$#But nobles like myself do so gracefully and still take home the prize.|
97624|#821$#Fighting? I see no reason to get my hands dirty.
#822$#Although, I'd be remiss if I didnt admit to feeling a thrill when crushing my foes beneath my feet...|
97625|What's your definition of a friend?|
97626|#821$#I don't believe in lifelong friends, nor enemies.
#822$#Interest comes first, especially among the upper classes.
#823$#I'm more than satisfied with being surrounded by young, blushing maidens.|
97627|#821$#The noble Bazoeri clan does not mingle with those beneath it.
#822$#Still...
#823$#Despite being a peasant, I consider you a friend.|
97628|How strong are you?|
97629|#821$#Celestial beings are like maidens, full of mystery.
#822$#Whether it be science or mythology, I like to study every angle...
#823$#Not that a simple peasant like you would understand.|
97630|#821$#Each maiden is a raw stone. It's up to me to...carve out their beauty.
#823$#The end result is always worth the effort.|
97631|Would you like to visit Navea?|
97632|#821$#Is this the place where all cultures come together?
#822$#Since you've invited me so earnestly, I'll go with you.
#823$#I'm rather curious about peasant culture.|
97633|#821$#Will we also see the Grand Bishop's reception hall?
#822$#Fear? What are you talking about? A true member of the Bazoeri knows no fear.|
97634|Do you want to go anywhere?|
97635|#821$#Starstruck Plateau... Do meteors really fall there?
#823$#I should like to witness this myself.|
97636|#821$#I have also heard of a magical potion in Sky Tower.
#822$#A potion that promises everlasting youth!|
97637|What do you know of the Elysium?|
97638|#821$#Tsk! It seems everyone yearns for a pure heaven.
#823$#What they don't know if that some happiness can only be achieved in darkness.|
97639|#821$#I've heard that angels roam the heavens.
#823$#I wonder what their blood tastes like...|
97640|What's your house like?|
97641|#821$#Hmm? "House"?
#822$# As in singular...? You have only one? Goodness, the life of a peasant is difficult indeed.|
97642|#821$#Sanctuaries in a house may provide you with useful materials. Don't forget to use them!
#822$#Come to me if you become desperate.
#823$#Looking after a commoner can't be all that difficult.|
97643|Do you like wine?|
97644|#821$#Ah, wine. Ample-bodied, deep, a bit salty, with a metallic bouquet.
#823$#It's a flavor I'll never forget.|
97645|#821$#I don't like just ANY wine.
#822$#It's important to consider the year, location, and season of production.
#821$#I drink only the finest.|
97646|I heard a rumor about you kidnapping girls.|
97647|#821$#Kidnapping? I'd never be reduced to such vulgar methods!
#822$#Maidens follow me willingly.|
97648|#821$#Oh? Could it be that you're jealous?
#823$#Shhh, pet. Be obedient and I promise to spoil you.|
97649|How old are you?|
97650|#821$#Gasp! How rude! You mustn't ask a lady such questions!
#822$#Repent at once!|
97651|#821$#Impudent peasant...
#822$#I shall overlook this one transgression.|
97652|Are there any warriors in your family?|
97653|#821$#Why, my lineage includes a king and two princes.
#822$#Do you know nothing of the great Bazoeri clan?
#821$#Tsk. Such ignorance.|
97654|#821$#Under the protection of the Bazoeri,
#822$#all our territories were spared the horrors of invasion.
#823$#I will offer you that same protection so long as we are together.|
97655|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97656|#823$Cleopawtra is worthy of praise!
#821$Her wisdom and skill place her in a class all her own.
#822$Don't she and I look fetching standing together?|
97657|#821$As for Bel-Chandra, even the heavens pale in comparison to her dance.
#823$I've been meaning to invite her over for a private performance.|
97658|Do you really need so many maids?|
97659|#821$#A full staff is necessary for maintaining the castle.
#823$#Among other things...|
97660|#821$#What's not to love about being surrounded by young, vibrant ladies?
#823$#Surely you'd enjoy it as well.|
97661|What's with the nickname Bloodthirsty Baroness?|
97662|#821$#It's nothing but the inane invention of a few impudent scoundrels.
#822$#My good upbringing forbids me from responding to such inferiority.|
97663|#821$#Heh! Only fools fear what they do not understand.
#822$#But you don't fear me, do you? I'm impressed.
#823$#My pet deserves a little reward.|
97664|Can you tell me more about your castle?|
97665|#821$#Interested in my home, are you?
#822$#Shall I invite you to stay? I promise to treat you well.
#823$#Just don't go wandering.|
97666|#821$#Some rooms are...off limits.
#822$#Each member of the Bazoeri clan owns at least one castle or villa, including the surrounding sanctuaries.
#821$#So you'll have to be more specific with your question.|
97667|You're very pretty.|
97668|#821$#Ha! A girl is pretty, my dear. I am beautiful.
#822$#I was called the most beautiful woman in the land. Need I say more? I mean, of course!|
97669|#821$#I never compromise when it comes to my beauty routine.
#822$#Especially the special drinks...
#823$#Ah, but that's all I can tell you for now. Perform well, and I just might tell you more.|
97670|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97671|#821$#You dare ask this while the head of the Bazoeri clan is by your side?
#824$#Do you wish to leave me? Looks like I've been remiss in your training.|
97672|#821$#I'm returning to Bazoeri now. I mustn't keep my maidens waiting...|
97673|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
97674|#822$#Exercise! Good old-fashioned exercise. With a little work, you can make yourself stronger and faster.
#821$#Why don't you give it a try?|
97675|#822$#There are so many interesting things at the market!
#821$#As soon as I set foot in there... I'm swarmed by beggars and people trying to sell me things...
#822$#There are so many people in this world who need help!|
97676|What do you know about the God of Battle?|
97677|#821$#Haha, let's go! Draw your weapon!
#823$#Let me answer that question with my spear!|
97678|#821$#There are always people that need protection...
#822$#Yes? Is that what you are? Didn't we work together before? Weren't we partners?|
97679|What about our common enemy?|
97680|#822$#Rumor has it that Nidhogg is the ultimate dragon...
#821$#I'll keep training until I'm as strong as her!|
97681|#821$#Face everything head-on! We can't blink when faced with more powerful enemies!
#822$#The path to becoming a warrior starts with the strength of your heart!|
97682|What's your favorite food?|
97683|#821$#I know it's not fancy, but barbecued meat is the best!
#823$#It looks like Ayako and I speak the same language! Haha!|
97684|#821$#Barbecue! Every bite lifts your spirit!
#823$#Next time come with me! Try it, you'll love it!|
97685|You hate the weather?|
97686|#822$#It's a sunny day with just a little drizzle...
#823$#They always find something to like about the weather.|
97687|#822$#Is there any weather you hate?
#821$#Well then, let's train! When you're exercising,
#822$#the weather doesn't matter anymore!|
97688|What does friendship mean to you?|
97689|#821$#A friend is someone who will have your back no matter what!
#823$#Just like you and me!|
97690|#822$#Every time I see Kitami and Vermilion... I feel so peaceful...
#823$#They're such great friends.|
97691|Tell me about the Lancer.|
97692|#821$#It's totally my favorite weapon. It has the perfect range for attack and defense.
#822$#It's capable of harnessing the elemental powers of fire, ice, lightning, and darkness.|
97693|#821$#Advance and attack, retreat and defend.
#822$#It's why spears are the superior weapon type! Haha!|
97694|You want to know more about the Templars?|
97695|#821$#Do you want to join? Yes? Me? I don't want to join...
#822$#If you join, you're bound to protect certain places. You are told who you can help and where...
#821$#I prefer the freedom to help whoever I want, where I want! Haha!|
97696|#821$#Becoming a member of the Templars proves you have a certain type of strength!
#822$#If you really want to fight, this would be a great opportunity to test your strength!|
97697|There's a blue exclamation point on the map...|
97698|#821$#That means someone needs help!
#822$#Hurry! It's time to put our training to work!
#823$#Let's go! Go! Go!|
97699|#821$#If a villager runs into trouble, they'll tell you all about it.
#822$#That means they trust you and want your help!
#821$#We can't break this hard-won trust! Right?|
97700|About fishing.|
97701|#821$#You must be calm, relax your breathing...
#822$#Fishing can both meditation and exercise.
#823$#Come here! Pick up your fishing rod and let's go!|
97702|#821$#There's a powerful fish nearby known as the Fish King.
#822$#Its reaction time and strength are unmatched by any other fish.
#821$#Wouldn't it be so exciting to battle the Fish King and win?|
97703|Weapons and armor.|
97704|#821$#It's important that your weapons and armor fit your style!
#822$#... It's not just for exercise, this is more important. It's about protecting yourself!|
97705|#821$#Everyone's different personalities and style are reflected in their choices.
#822$#Some people value strength the most, others value speed...
#821$#What about you? What kind of weapon and armor will you choose?|
97706|Can I touch your tail?|
97707|#821$#Umm, no... Not even my friends can do that...
#822$#Oh! Don't look at me with those puppy dog eyes!|
97708|#821$#My tail may look soft and bendy, but it's covered in tiny scales.
#824$#They could easily cut your hands. Do you still want to touch it?|
97709|It seems like you get cheated a lot.|
97710|#821$#Don't take things so seriously. Our chief said that I'm fine the way I am!|
97711|#821$#If I can help someone and they're happy, that's good enough for me.
#823$#People being happy is the most important thing to me.|
97712|Your hometown.|
97713|#821$#My hometown...? It's a solemn, somber place...
#823$#But it always gives me a warm feeling.|
97714|#821$#There's something special about it...
#823$#There's a huge dragon statue there.
#822$#I've head other places have different statues, but I haven't seen them.|
97715|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97716|#821$#Kitami and Vermilion are tasked with the mission of the four races.
#822$#We need to work harder to protect the important objects.|
97717|#821$#Nidhogg is surrounded by a powerful aura...
#822$#Even though she's incredibly strong, she refuses to help the weak.
#824$#It's unacceptable!|
97718|About the Four Holy Beasts.|
97719|#821$#Legend has it that the Four Holy Beasts are bound to each of the four races. They exist to protect them from hidden threats!
#822$#We never talk about what they protect them from though...|
97720|#821$#The Four Holy Beasts? They are generational messengers of the four races.
#822$#I'll follow the chief too! I'll shoulder this burden and become even stronger!|
97721|It seems like a lot of people worship you.|
97722|#821$#Yes... It seems to be something to do with Eastern culture.
#822$#I actually haven't done that much... It's just fame left over from generations of chiefs before me.|
97723|#821$#They seem to think I'm a legend. Earning trust and adoration by helping others...
#823$#It makes me feel grounded.|
97724|What are you biggest wishes?|
97725|#821$#To visit every corner of this world and help anyone who needs it.
#823$#I long to fill this world with joy and laughter!|
97726|#821$#To do all that with trusting friends at your back is just great.
#823$#I hope all of this lasts forever!|
97727|Do you like reading?|
97728|#821$#...Huh? Oh, umm...
#822$#Helping others requires a pure heart and the drive to achieve your goals!
#821$#As for reading... Let's change the subject!|
97729|#821$#Oh! You mean, reading books?
#822$#I have been bathed in the sea of battle many times.
#821$#Books were a place to find solace in hard times. Heehee...|
97730|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97731|#821$#... Whatever problems you have, let's face them together!
#824$#Don't talk about splitting up like that! Didn't we agree to explore the world together? Did something change?!|
97732|#821$#... Real friends don't need to be physically close, they're always together in spirit!
#822$#It's settled! Even if we're not side-by-side, we won't stop helping people!
#823$#That way we'll hear the amazing tales of each other's adventures across the land.|
97733|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
97734|#821$#Hmm... There is usually a book in which stories are written.
#822$#Ah... No... I can't show you yet. I'll show you once I've finished.|
97735|#821$#The beauty of the story is that you get to enjoy different experiences.
#823$#I'll weave these stories into my hundred tales... It's almost done.|
97736|What's your favorite food?|
97737|#821$#People's souls come in all sorts of flavors...
#823$#Hey... Are you also curious about what your soul tastes like?|
97738|#821$#The sweetest soul of all is a fearful one.
#823$#A soul like that fascinates me to no end...|
97739|Changing seasons?|
97740|#821$#On a balmy summer's night, with hardly a breeze blowing...
#823$#In such a season, only a horror tale can induce shivers.|
97741|#821$#Hot summer nights are perfect for refreshing stories like these...
#822$#The sweat gracing your skin won't just be from the heat...|
97742|What's your most memorable experience?|
97743|#821$#For as a far back as I can remember, I've never seen a sunrise... I have spent my life wandering the night...
#822$#But after meeting you, I can now move about in the light.
#824$#Although... I still hate the daytime...|
97744|#821$#Once upon a time, I joined a Hundred Tales gathering, and when it was my turn to tell the hundredth story...
#822$#Black tentacles descended from the ceiling, and everyone suddenly disappeared...
#824$#Now, how could that happen...? I was only finishing up my story...|
97745|Songs that I often sing?|
97746|#821$#My favorite song is...an unconscious hum.
#823$#Hm... The lyrics are all my own creation.|
97747|#823$#You... Do you like this song too?
#821$#"Begone! Begone, I say! Leave this world without a trace!"
#822$#"Destroy the Netherworld Lamps and set fire to the thrones of Pandemonium."
#823$#"Go on! Go on! Free yourself from this world forever!"|
97748|Do you prefer day or night?|
97749|#824$#When the dazzling sun emerges...the lantern's light is extinguished.
#821$#Daytime is annoying, don't you think?|
97750|#821$#Only the darkest night can match the lantern's brilliance...
#823$#Is there nothing finer than lighting a candle in a pitch-black room?|
97751|Is there anywhere you'd like to go?|
97752|#821$#... Is there a place where night never ends?
#823$#Ghostweep Cave, perhaps? Excellent... There you can listen to stories forever...|
97753|#821$#I heard that the Tanglevine Cascades are full of beautiful fruits that shine like laterns at night.
#823$#They must be quite beautiful to behold. It's something I would like to see for myself...|
97754|Tell me about Quests.|
97755|#821$#Hm... If you want to help others, why not have a look at the Map in your hand?
#822$#The quest information is recorded there in detail.
#823$#I wonder if...it has anything to do with the Storytelling Quests?|
97756|#821$#I have a quest that I'd like to entrust you with...
#823$#Do you think you could help me gather some people to come to a storytelling?|
97757|Transmitting Information.|
97758|#823$#A long time ago, I wrote a letter from Pandemonium.|
97759|#821$#Letters... I've never really written to anyone...
#823$#Oh...um... Yes... Now I have someone I can write to.|
97760|About the Eternal Codex.|
97761|#821$#...A book? That records memories...? Do you mean like a biography?
#823$#Hm... I too have a book that records all kinds of strange tales.|
97762|#821$#Is it a book from your Eternal Codex?
#823$#I should like to listen to them if they contain strange and scary stories...|
97763|What are the Hundred Tales?|
97764|#821$#The Hundred Tales is a game from long ago, comprised of as many stories.
#823$#I love this kind of game the most... Would you like to play it too?|
97765|#821$#Everyone gathers in the dark of night to light the candles of a hundred lanterns...
#822$#Strange stories are exchanged. With each story told, one candle must be blown out until all one hundred go dark.
#823$#This...is the Hundred Tales.|
97766|Do you like listening to stories?|
97767|#821$#Do you like it too? I haven't heard a story in quite some time...
#823$#But... I hope to hear a scary story.|
97768|#821$#Eerie horror stories are the most interesting...
#823$#Especially on a night with a strong, howling wind and illuminated by a hundred candles...|
97769|You have beautiful eyes.|
97770|#821$#Are they really like purple stained glass? I've been told this before, but I've never really looked at myself.
#823$#Your eyes are beautiful as well, but I'd much rather see something else...|
97771|#821$#The eyes may be the window to the soul, but the heart reveal far, far more.
#823$#... Do you want it? Shall I give it to you?|
97772|The lantern is so special.|
97773|#821$#This Spirit Lamp blooms with Netherworld Flames that lead souls to the end.
#823$#Hm... You seem curious. Are you also interested in seeing the end?|
97774|#821$#Light a hundred candles, blow out all but one, and that will be the Spirit Lamp.
#822$#Are you drawn to it too? Hold on... The story isn't over yet...|
97775|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
97776|#821$#The story of Muramasa and the warrior is as delightful as they come.
#823$#The tales I write also have similar plots.|
97777|#821$#The warm spring flowers and the cold winter snow were never destined to meet...
#822$#Shirayuki, she...should understand.|
97778|Let's play a game.|
97779|#821$#My favorite game...is listening to strange stories.
#823$#The more people who play, the more fun, yes?|
97780|#821$#Hmm... How about a storytelling game, then?
#823$#It's already been agreed... Before one hundred stories are told... No one leaves...|
97781|Where are you from?|
97782|#821$#I'm afraid I don't know the answer to that myself... Where did I come from?
#822$#For as far back as I can remember, I've wandered the earth...|
97783|#821$#At night, when people gather to tell strange stories, I'm there.
#822$#... My hometown...? Hmm... I can't remember anymore.|
97784|Why is everyone afraid of you?|
97785|#821$#It has always perplexed me... What do you think is the reason?
#822$#I just...want to hear everyone's story...|
97786|#824$#Are you afraid of me too...? It's alright... I'm used to it anyhow...|
97787|What are you most eager to do?|
97788|#821$#We need more stories... We'll have ninety-nine soon...
#823$#But please allow me to tell the final tale.|
97789|#821$#... Would you like to spend the evening with me listening to stories?
#823$#Horror stories are perfect for a quiet night...|
97790|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97791|#821$#When every flower and every tree has withered away, and the streams have all dried up, we shall part ways...
#823$#I'll wait for you at the end of the bridge before you drink something to make you forget...|
97792|#821$#We'll share ninety-nine stories with one another and just as the sun rises...
#823$#I will tell you the hundredth story again before we part ways...|
97793|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
97794|#821$#Oh~ I love to study about different ways to take care of hair~
#822$#Do you want me to take care of your hair too?|
97795|#821$#Go look at people's fields, see how they're growing...
#823$#Or find a comfy place to nap~|
97796|What's your favorite food?|
97797|#821$#Golden wheat is beautiful and nutritious~
#823$#Here's some porridge I made~ Do you want to try?|
97798|#821$#The golden wheat looks beautiful. Golden Apples look good too...
#823$#Oh? Is it strange to like food based on its color?|
97799|Changing seasons?|
97800|#821$#Autumn is the time for harvest~
#823$#The wheat is especially golden this time of the year~ So amazing~|
97801|#821$#Oh~ Autumn is the sweetest and warmest season~
#822$#Idun alwayws smells like fruits at these times~|
97802|What's your most memorable experience?|
97803|#821$#It used to be a great time to nap in Idun's Orchard...
#822$#Until a yucky creature appeared...
#824$#Ha, Master, let's stop here.|
97804|#821$#People harvesting, sweat rolling down their faces, feeling rich satisfaction in honest labor.
#823$#I will never forget about that pure and simple joy.|
97805|Farm Folk Song?|
97806|#821$#Oh? Are you talking about the folk song that farmers sing in the field?
#823$#Down-to-earth and fun. I like it too~|
97807|#821$#Do you want me to sing?
#823$#Baby~ Sleep~ Oh? Not this one...?|
97808|You hair bow is the shape of wheat.|
97809|#824$#Oh~ Do you think it is cute?
#821$#I have considered dying it golden too~
#821$#What do you think about it?|
97810|#821$#Someone said my blonde hair shines like the golden wheat...
#823$#What about you? Do you think my blonde hair is beautiful?|

97812|#821$#I heard you can fish a Golden Temptation in Secret Forest Lake...
#823$#They say it's so golden and beautiful! I really want to see it~|
97813|#821$#Oh~ There is a plant called Highland Wheat in Triatio Highlands,
#823$#I can turn it into a tasty porridge~|
97814|Let's talk about other races.|
97815|#821$#Every race has a purpose, a reason to live.
#822$#Demeter said this. And I agree very much...
#824$#But she seemed hurt by humans...|
97816|#821$#Those sensitive Goblins...
#823$#I hear they are incredibly good treasure hunters. They must have a lot of gold~|
97817|Do you know about the Exchange?|
97818|#821$#It's a place you can find what you seek, and also earn a lot of gold~
#823$#Oh~ I'm happy whenever I think about all that beautiful gold~|
97819|#821$#Looks like a good place to go~
#822$# But there are some things you can't buy!

#823$#The light of the chalcedony reminds me of the wheat~|
97823|Is someone pranking you in Idun's Orchard?|
97824|#821$#Pranks?
#824$#You call such boorish affrontery pranks?
#824$#If you ever let me hear this again... I won't warn you anymore, Master!|
97825|#821$#That person... No, that creature,
#822$#He is unforgivable...
#824$#Even if he tries to make up for it, I will not forgive him...|
97826|Are you friends with Idun?|
97827|#821$#When the apples are ripe, I'll secretly help Idun harvest~
#823$#Oh~ You can't tell people about this~|
97828|#821$#Idun's special job...
#823$#Basically~ No one would mess with her~|
97829|May I touch your hair?|
97830|#821$#Huh? What are you saying?
#824$#The wind was too loud just now. I couldn't hear you, Master?|
97831|#821$#If someone else asked me, I wouldn't let them...
#822$#But since it's you~ I will break the rule for once...
#823$#Please be gentle and careful~|
97832|You're very pretty.|
97833|#821$#But... You're nice, but I know what they say, that I'm not the prettiest one...
#822$#It's OK... I don't mind very much...
#823$#As long as you think I'm pretty, that's enough~|
97834|#821$#I do have the most impressive hair, though, right?

#823$#Let me help you comb your hair~|
97841|What are your real passions?|
97842|#821$#My past self would say it's my hair...

97843|#821$#Oh~ many~ fertile land, healthy crops...
#823$#He's always leaving trails of food made of whatever he planned to bring! The most important thing besides my hair is you~|
97844|Gold in the ground?|
97845|#821$#Oh~ That's only the nickname of my hair~
#822$#They said my hair is shining like gold~
#823$#It makes me a bit shy~|
97846|#823$#The compliments make me happy, but shy too~
#821$#Does that mean my hair treatments are perfectly done?|
97847|Did I see you last time...|
97848|#821$#Oh~ Did you see me comb Kitami's hair?
#822$#Well... I don't like tangled hair...
#823$#I only slightly combed it, and the hair became soft and beautiful~|
97849|#821$#Did you see me braid Gretel's hair?
#823$#These siblings are cute~
#822$#What a pity... When I was ready to help Hansel, he'd already run away...|
97850|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97851|#821$#Will we meet again...? Well...
#823$#No problem. I'll keep the porridge ready until you call my name again...|
97852|#821$#So... When you see the golden wheat,
#822$#Will you remember me?|
97853|Favorite music?|
97854|#821$#My favorite sound is the aggressive booming of my battlefield drum!
#823$#It gets my blood pounding!|
97855|#821$#And don't forget the shriek of the battle horn!
#822$#And the howl of charging troops! And the slashing of swords! 
#823$#Ha-ha-ha! Wonderful! Really wonderful!|
97856|What's your favorite food?|
97857|#821$#Meat, of course! Delicious chunks of it on the bone!
#823$#Just thinking about it! The flesh of an animal killed just for me! In fact, that does it! Enough talk! Let's go get food!|

#823$#Ha-ha-ha! Right! Braaaainnsss... Chunks of animal! As rare as possible!|
97859|How do you usually train?|
97860|#821$#Fighting is the best training! Every minute on the battlefield will make you stronger!
#823$#I've spent many years fighting battles, and that's why I have this strong physique!|
97861|#821$#A man should never stop training his body!
#822$#Take a look at my armor and sword together they must weigh at least 5 tons!
#823$#The weight would flatten a splinter like you! Ha-ha-ha!|
97862|Do you have any weaknesses?|
97863|#823$#Ha-ha-ha! My weakness is that I'm too powerful!
#821$#...what, you think I'm kidding? Don't believe me!|
97864|#821$#How could muscles like these ever weaken?
#824$#What? Hot-headed and impetuous? Nonsense!|
97865|Mistakes you've made?|
97866|#821$#All my life I've been magnanimous and I've always stayed true to my convictions.
#822$#What? Where'd you hear those lies?|
97867|#821$#As long as people don't disrespect me, I leave them alone.
#824$#Sigh... the only mistake I've made is staying here and listening to you doubting me!|
97868|What do you know about the God of Battle?|
97869|#823$#Power is everything! No matter who the enemy is, a powerful attack will topple them every time!|
97870|#821$#You're asking the right person, I was born for battle!
#823$#Attack is the best defense, and with absolute power you are invincible!|
97871|Let's talk about other races.|
97872|#821$#Have you heard of the centaurs? I really like those guys! They're courageous and proud!
#823$#I look forward to having a contest with them one day. Ha-ha-ha!|
97873|#821$#I don't trust those sinister-looking Goblins, though they're all up to something!
#824$#Tut! I just can't get along with them.|
97874|What do you know about the Quests?|
97875|#821$#You're making progress! Good! I like it!

97876|#821$#You can find additional quests in the bulletin boards in towns and cities.
#822$#Ha-ha! Don't you know more about these things than I do?|
97877|Do you know what the Holy vs Evil Showdown is?|

#823$#...Strategy? I don't need tricks! Power is everything!|
97879|#821$#It doesn't matter what faction's behind me. Any side I'm on wins!
#823$#With unlimited power and a stature that takes up seven hectares, I sweep the enemy away before me!|
97880|About the Eternal Codex.|
97881|#821$#Huh? What book? I don't look at squinty stuff like that!
#823$#Killing is much more interesting!|
97882|#821$#Is your memory that poor? Can't you think of anything?
#822$#What? Very well, I'll help you find the book.|
97883|Concerning Astraea...|
97884|#821$#I get angry when I hear that woman's name!
#824$#I am the bold and powerful God of War, but that trifling goddess defeats me time and time again...
#822$#...It's not right! I cannot lose! My power cannot be overcome!|
97885|#821$#That woman plotted against me using a giant stone! I fell to the ground, humiliated!
#824$#Arghhh! The more I think of it the angrier I get! I'm going to go have it out with her!|
97886|Know Hermes?|
97887|#821$#Hermes is the only decent one among those hypocrites!
#822$#I don't know why she mixes with them.|
97888|#821$#You are talking about Hermes?
#822$#She was there when I needed her and she's been a good friend ever since.|
97889|Relationship with the gods.|
97890|#824$#I don't have time for them! They are all power-hungry scoundrels!
#824$#If you mention them again... Well, don't say I didn't warn you!|
97891|#824$#I have nothing good to say about them!
#824$#They'll use any excuse to try and keep me down!|
97892|You have a resonant voice.|
97893|#821$#I can give a blood-curdling roar that sounds like the battle cry of a hundred-thousand soldiers!
#823$#It's an ear-splitting sound, a bellow of might and majesty that overwhelms the enemy!|
97894|#821$#A real man has a loud voice!
#823$#Ha-ha-ha! People form an impression of you as soon as you open your mouth.|
97895|Tell me some interesting gossip about Eidolons.|
97896|#821$#I'm assuming you've heard about the thing with Tanith, Venus, and Astraea?
#822$#What? No? Everyone was talking about it.
#824$#Sigh... you can't get on the wrong side of a woman!|
97897|#821$#Hermes always says that her older sister's singing voice is elegant and moving.
#824$#...Mine's not bad either! Grand and domineering, wouldn't you say?|
97898|Strong physique.|
97899|#822$#Sigh... Looking at your skinny build... How about I help you train?
#823$#As I always say: The only thing you can truly rely on is your own strength.|
97900|#821$#Every day I train myself by lifting 10,000-pound weights, and eating 100 pounds of meat
#822$#Not to mention my practice with my sword - which weighs 1 ton!
#823$#If you want to be like me, you'll need a strong and powerful physique like mine!|
97901|Battlefield exploits.|
97902|#823$#Ha-ha-ha! Want to hear about my brilliant achievements?
#822$#That would take more nights than there are!
#821$#Wait! Hey! Where are you going? Come back with what I asked for!|
97903|#823$#Ha-ha-ha-ha! I do love to brag!
#822$#But since you want to know. I'll tell you!
#823$#When it comes to my bravest exploit, nothing can surpass my three days and nights fighting alone against a million troops!|
97904|Introduce your weapon.|
97905|#823$#Ha-ha-ha! So you noticed my bold and powerful sword!
#821$#It is my partner as I rush headlong into battle! No enemy can survive my sword!|
97906|#821$#It's called "Frenzy", and it's as fierce as its name!
#823$#Holding it gently in my hands, I can easily cleave a mountain in two!
#824$#What's that look for? Don't believe me? Let me show you on that nearby mountain!|
97907|Bad temperament?|
97908|#821$#How is my temperament?
#822$#What's the scowl for? I'm loud but not overbearing!|
97909|#821$#This is the way I normally speak. Do you think I'm angry?
#822$#Well? Want to see what I'm like when I'm really angry?!|
97910|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97911|#821$#I'm no good at those nauseating goodbyes.
#823$#When we part, we should just turn and then go our separate ways, none of this blubbering.|
97912|#821$#If you've seen one tearful parting you've seen them all!
#822$#I don't need to be attached to someone else!|
97913|Do you like summer?|
97914|#821$#The sun has little effect on me, my dragon scales protect me from the scorching heat!
#822$#I can adapt to any environment.|
97915|#821$#Still, even if the sun is useless against me, I don't quite like it.
#823$#Swimming is quite relaxing for me.|
97916|Don't you hate wearing a swimsuit?|
97917|#821$#In my opinion, it's neither fun or boring. It's just a matter of apparel.
#823$#But the invention of the human world was very convenient.|
97918|#822$#I like both the human kind and the human inventions.|
97919|Can you help me to catch the fish king?|
97920|#821$#Fishing for me is tricky, but I want to give it a try.|
97921|#821$#You need to be determined to fight the Fish King!|
97922|I want to be as powerful as you are!|
97923|#821$#You are a wise person, follow your heart.
#822$#All you need is persistence and hard work.|
97924|#821$#Hold your horses! Be patient, things come at the right time.
#822$#Time will make you better.|
97925|What is your impression of me?|
97926|#821$#You're young and full of potential. I look forward to guide you though the path.
#823$#It's not easy to admit the defeat after failing. This is one of your strengths.|
97927|#821$#Can I ask you something? Do you lack confidence?
#822$#For me, your will is strong.|
97928|I want to know how has life treated you.|
97929|#822$#I've come a long way till here, things come and go too fast.
#821$#I don't care about things like I used to do.|
97930|#821$#The past is just water under the bridge now; I don't remember much.
#822$#I realized life is just a bundle of moments that serve as a memorial.|
97931|Is heaven actually better than hell?|
97932|#822$#In my experience, heaven is a charming place where good peeps are having a nice moment.
#821$#Hell is not as dangerous as most people picture it, but there are a bunch evil people.|
97933|#822$#These two worlds are not so different to me.
#821$#No matter where you go, I will be there for you.|
97934|What do you think about the human world created by the Cube of Gaia?|
97935|#821$#The human world is very fragile as well as its creatures.
#823$#Nevertheless, the human world is a ever-changing one.|
97936|#821$#The human world is nothing like the heaven or hell.
#822$#But I think this is the ideal world for human beings.
#823$#A world brimming with creation and imagination.|
97937|How can I become rich?|
97938|#822$#I wouldn't take advantage of it, even with my strength and power.
#821$#You can sell unnecessary bags in exchange for money.|
97939|#821$#I've heard of a popular and valuable item named Obobo dictionary among merchants.
#822$#You may be able to find this.|
97940|How can I get stronger quickly?|
97941|#823$#Your diet can help you to enhance your abilities, try it!|
97942|#822$#I heard that Maya and some scholars from the magic alchemy are doing some refining.
#821$#I can go to the Navea to learn from her.|
97943|Have you ever eaten watermelon?|
97944|#822$#That thing with a green skin and the red juicy part.
#821$#It tastes very good, it's sweet and refreshing.|
97945|#822$#You should give it a try!
#821$#We can taste it as human beings.|
97946|Do you like to watch fireworks?|
97947|#822$#You look so happy right now!
#821$#Oh, but I don't think there is anything wrong with this thing?|
97948|#822$#Take a look at it anyways. See? You look so happy! I have to take a deeper look at this thing.|
97949|Are you good at swimming?|
97950|#822$#I've got it in my blood. Everyone in my family is an amazing swimmer.
#821$#Soaring through the clouds is so similar to swimming.|
97951|#822$#I'm only familiar with it, it's just that practice makes perfect.
#821$#After all, I am way far more experienced.|
97952|Does your hometown have a sea?|
97953|#821$#There's a beautiful seafront in my hometown.
#822$#There's an endless abyss under the sea, a bit like the hell of this world.|
97954|#822$#Water is super important for all those creatures!
#821$#I don't think my hometown is so important.|
97955|Tell me some interesting gossip about Eidolons.|
97956|#822$#Nidhogg and Young Fang have a similar strength,
#821$#but being shortsighted is such a cont.
#821$#A few days I will meet someone who will outsmart him.|
97957|#821$#Ares clearly has the power to pass it on his bloodline.
#822$#But intelligence is the realm of power.
#821$#Do not neglect your learning, you can play to the extreme.|
97958|Doomsday first? Are you still first?|
97959|#822$#You're thinking about my existence?
#821$#My existence is not to bring the end, I can solve the end.|
97960|#822$#It is truly a honor for me to meet you.
#821$#When the world ends, it is time for me to appear.|
97961|Looking for someone to go with you to the Summer Festival?|
97962|#821$#The man was within a stone's throw, and I had no trouble finding him.|
97963|#822$#Thou shalt not mock me, for I have found this man.
#821$#Are you confused? You are the one I seek.|
97964|Where did you put your clothes?|
97965|#822$#I can cut through the space, my body can be anywhere I want.|
97966|#821$#My clothing is actually a dragon family treasure, it can be arbitrarily changed.
#822$#I do not need to worry about clothing.|
97967|You know how much!|
97968|#821$#In fact, the results of the accumulation of time coincides with your confusion.
#822$#I am happy to help you understand, so that you can understand the world even more.|
97969|#821$#I've seen a lot and have a lot of experience.
#822$#But the knowledge accumulated by the Three Realms is more than the one I have.
#823$#With you, I also saw a lot of fun.|
97970|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
97971|#824$#Unless your existence is completely destroyed, you will come through time and space.
#821$#If you can't do it, no one can do it. There is no need to worry.|
97972|#822$#If you want to part ways, then I will become a ghost.
#823$#If you want my existence, I will exist.|
97973|Have you ever felt fear?|
97974|#821$#Fear? I feed on my enemy's despair!
#822$#Yummy, dread and panic for dessert! It's delicious!|
97975|#821$#Strong people are fearless.
#822$You're the Envoy of Gaia! Do you understand? |
97976|Have you seen the fireworks?|
97977|#821$#Hmm, do you mean that vanishing beauty on the sky?
#823$#It's so fragile and fleeting, just like the life of the weaklings! Hahaha!|
97978|#822$#I'll blow my enemies just like those sparklers... BOOM!|
97979|Do you know how to swim?|
97980|#821$#Hey! Are you kidding me? I am like a fish in water!
#822$#Excuse me? Do you want me to swim laps? This kind of items can totally tick me off!|
97981|#824$#Bah, don't worry about this kind of little things!|
97982|Have you tried a watermelon before?|
97983|#821$#Hey, do you want some of my watermelon?
#824$#Come on, take some! You know you want it!
|
97984|#821$#Well, it's not as tasty as the roots from the World Tree,
#822$#but it's not that bad; specially for a human snack.|
97985|Do you like building sand castles?|
97986|#821$#What a weird question.
#823$#I could build a whole palace right here and right now if I wanted to!|
97987|#821$#Oh, so you mean the ones kids build at the beach?
#822$#Ok, let's get started! I'm ready to build a skyscraper!|
97988|Why do you want to destroy the world?|
97989|#822$#Natural selection! One the fittest can survive!|
97990|#824$#The despicable weaklings will only drag down the strong ones. Annihilation is the only solution.|
97991|Have you heard of the Monster Research Institute?|
97992|#821$#Hmm, is that the place where humans keep monster captive?
#823$#I'll build a human research institute if I get the chance.|
97993|#821$#Would humans want to investigate magic in those conditions as well?
#824$#They'll get a taste of their own medicine, one day.|
97994|Have you heard about Frigga Peak?|
97995|#821$#Is that the big snowy mountain?
#822$#It's a nice location filled with gruesome creatures.|
97996|#821$#It's indeed nicer than its inhabitants. 
#822$#I enjoy seeing people freezing and shivering in there! Hahahaha!|
97997|Do you know how to cook?|
97998|#821$#Cooking? I really don't understand why you have to play with food.
#822$#Isn't food good enough by itself?|
97999|#821$#What kind of food? Do people still name their food?
#822$#Weak creatures actually amuse me.|
98000|Do you like cottages?|
98001|#821$That bunch of timber, nails, and stone?
#822$I'm doing my best no to laugh about the human concept of aesthetics.|
98002|#821$#That awful little hovel? It barely covers the sun.|
98003|What is your impression of summer?|
98004|#824$#Tsk! Aelius' ignorance about sunshine will only nourish the weak.|
98005|#821$#Isn't this the season when the weaklings rest and go on vacations?
#822$One day I'll have summer under the snow.|
98006|Have you heard of Alucard?|
98007|#821$#Isn't him the Dragon Tyrant?
#822$#Do you dare mentioning his name in front of me? I'll prove I'm the best one!|
98008|#821$#The pretentious guy who talks and talks and talks?
#822$#One day I'll make him bite the dust.|
98009|What do you think of Eidolons?|
98010|#821$#Are you kidding me? I'm playing in another league.
#822$#Well, you have a little bit more of potential.|
98011|#824$#Hey, with my help you'll get stronger than them!
#822$#The world needs you at full potential to stop its destruction!|
98012|Wear this so you don't catch a cold!|
98013|#821$#Hey! Do you think I am weak?
#824$#I'm not afraid of snowstorms, not even when Eirene brings her dreadful Blizzards!|
98014|#823$#Only the weaklings should worry about the cold.|
98015|Tell me some interesting gossip about Eidolons.|
98016|#821$#I heard that the Dragon Tyrant bought a new swimsuit.
#822$#Tsk! Weaklings always copy the trendsetters.|
98017|#821$#Apparently Zashi is in charge of setting up the mood.
#824$#Easy, don't worry. That bubble of happiness will burst without my help.|
98018|Let's have a picnic together!|
98019|#821$#Why? Well, I might only if there is world-class food.
#822$#Just don't pick a dumpster with dirty squirrels or eagles.|
98020|#821$#Well, it's fine, just because you ask for it.
#822$#Don't forget to prepare soul ice, bloody watermelon juice, and charcoal roasted roots.
#821$#What makes you think I'm kidding?|
98021|Looking for another camping site.|
98022|#821$#You're talking about camping with other inferior creatures?
#822$#Well, it's fine. At least Uriel can light a campfire.
#823$#And Alice is not a bad cook herself!
#822$#What do you mean by my responsibilities? Well, of course you're in charge of commanding and eating.|
98023|#821$#Do I really need to do this?
#822$#Well, you can find a responsible Eidolon to do it.
#823$Gigas' brute force is useful to set up a tent, chop wood, and other stuff.|
98024|Let's go to the beach and look at the stars.|
98025|#821$#Hahaha, this is so boring!
#822$Just sitting there looking at twinkling things in the sky is such a weak thing to do!
#821$#Oh, I would rather take the time to eat more.|
98026|#821$#I don't even look at Serena's eyes, what makes you think I'd enjoy seeing dead little stones?|
98027|Let's go to the Summer Festival!|
98028|#821$#Are you going to huddle with those vulgar creatures?
#822$#Tell the vendors to pile some food to honor me.|
98029|#821$#The residents of the area can organize a food festival.
#823$#It's not a joke! Eating bad food is such a nightmare!|
98030|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98031|#821$#Part ways? Being with me is such a honor, you should feel dignified!
#823$#I'm sure you'll enjoy having first row tickets for the Apocalypse! Hahahaha!|
98032|#821$#You're the last thing I want to look at.
#822$I will give you the opportunity to see the sun tomorrow before I destroy you! Hahaha!|
98033|What's your favorite food?|
98034|#821$#Hands down, Korean cabbage is the most delicious thing in the whole world.
#823$#I like to savor each tend leaf slowly.|
98035|#823$#Nothing beats fresh, sweet green vegetables.
#821$#I can eat a dozen Korean dishes in one meal, no problem!|
98036|Ugh. Disgusting food.|
98037|#824$#Rice is just... Huh? I said, RICE! No need to shout.
#824$#Why, you ask? No real reason, I just don't like it...|
98038|#821$#Want to hear a secret? More than anything, I hate eating fish the most.
#822$#Now that you know, you better not try sneaking fish into my dinner!
#824$#If you do, I'll... I'll never speak to you again!|
98039|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
98040|#822$#When I perform a sword dance, there's no room left for anything but concentraing on the graceful steps.
#821$#Um... If you're ever worried about something, I'll teach you a simple dance.|
98041|#821$#Idle moments are great too, perfect for gazing at the moon.
#823$#Worrying about everything all the time is pretty pointless, don't you think?|
98042|Do you prefer day or night?|
98043|#822$#What a question! I'm actually a little disappointed...
#821$#I thought...you were a fellow lover of moonlight.|
98044|#821$#Shouldn't you already know my answer?
#823$#You're standing before the moon's emissary, after all.|
98045|I hear you're sort of a clean freak?|
98046|#821$#Well, you heard wrong.
#824$#... Why? Hey, watch it with those dirty hands! Stay away from me!|
98047|#821$#I'm just tidier than most! That's right! That's it!
#824$#Anyway... You're not a bad person, are you?|
98048|Do you like to fight?|
98049|#821$#F-fight...? I have no interest in stuff like that.
#824$#Er, but make no mistake! If someone offends me, I won't let them off easy!|
98050|#821$#I'm of the mind that if you don't mess with me, I won't mess with you.
#824$#But if the other side insists on a fight, I won't back down!|
98051|Let's talk about other races.|
98052|#821$#...... Makar, Avian, Goblin... Each one has its own customs.
#823$#Shouldn't you know more about where you live than I do?|
98053|#823$#Oh, but I did come across some rabbits earlier! They were so chubby and cute!
#821$#Hmm? Me...? What are you talking about? I'm not a rabbit.|
98054|Is there anywhere you'd like to go?|
98055|#821$#Um... Are you familiar with Emerald Marsh?
#823$#I heard something about a monster that appears at night among the wisteria trees.
#821$#I'm dying to see the beauty of it with my own eyes. You'll take me there, won't you?|
98056|#821$#...... I especially want to go to a place called Oblitus Wood.
#823$#It's said that when night falls, the moon resembles a sparkling diamond.
#821$#I wonder how such beauty compares to our country.|
98057|Transmitting Information.|
98058|#821$#I haven't written a letter in ages. To think that Amaterasu and I often exchanged journals in the beginning...
#824$#What? I-I didn't say anything! I can't stand that arrogant brat!|
98059|#821$#You'll need a quill and ink to write letters, right? Let me grind the ink for you.
#823$#I'm sort of curious what you'd write about. Oh, this letter is for me?
#821$#Geez. Y-you've got to warn me before you do stuff like that...|
98060|About the Eternal Codex.|
98061|#821$#Oops. I guess that's bound to happen to your brain as you get older, huh...
#823$#No problem. I'll help you find the book that records your memories.
#821$#...... I heard it can be found in a hidden house somewhere in Navea.|
98062|#821$#Um... I've read literally thousands of books but not the Eternal Codex.
#823$#If that book is important to you, I'll help you find it.|
98063|You're very beautiful.|
98064|#823$#Huh? Oh, uh, m-me...? Thank you, thank you.
#821$#You did just call me beautiful, right? Should I be this happy?|
98065|#821$#Hmm. You know, now that I look more closely... You're really quite beautiful as well.
#823$#...... My cheeks feel hot. Let's talk about something else...|
98066|Your weapon is really special.|
98067|#822$#Ah, my short sword? It was a gift from a very special someone...
#821$#Eh? What's that? Who? Tell me who! Um... Agree to perform a sword dance with me, and I'll consider it.|
98068|#822$#In addition to this, I also have a spiritual sword.
#821$#But I draw it only during duels. If you wish to see it... You'll have to challenge me to duel, I guess.|
98069|I've heard that you're a vegetarian? But meat is so delicious!|
98070|#824$#Nah ah ah! Don't even think of eating meat in front of me.
#824$#How indecent... What a dirty past I've lived...|
98071|#821$#... Meat is downright filthy. Can you really avoid it?
#824$#Uh... If you insist on putting meat in your mouth, please be at least ten meters away from me first, all right?|
98072|What is the Land of Midnight Snacks?|
98073|#823$#It's a wonderful place cloaked in eternal night.
#821$#Um... I'm curious... How did you hear of it?|
98074|#821$#I govern that beautiful country. Being able to admire the stars whenever I please, I couldn't ask for more.
#823$#Oh! I really want you to see it for yourself someday. You'll never miss daylight again, I promise.|
98075|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98076|#821$#... I wasn't expecting you to be such a busybody.
#822$#Now that you mention it, I heard that Serena and Aelius aren't exactly on speaking terms.
#823$#Naturally, I'm on her side. Bet you can guess why.|
98077|#821$#Did you know that Amaterasu has an addiction? She's had it since birth.
#823$#Haha! It's funny to watch her try to hide it.|
98078|Do you have a sister?|
98079|#822$#Huh? Oh, you mean that high and mighty Amaterasu?
#821$#Yeah, well... She's more like a stain on my life than a sister.|
98080|#822$#Just be glad you don't have to deal with her.
#821$#Hey... Unless you like arrogant, annoying people. In which case, I advise you to seek help first.|
98081|Getting along with Amaterasu lately?|
98082|#824$#Hey! I can't even be in the same room as her, let alone get along.|
98083|#822$#After our big fight, we vowed not to meet anymore.
#821$#Hey... I could laugh all day long about the size of her ego.|
98084|Amaterasu called you violent and unreasonable. She's really awful!|
98085|#824$#"What was that? I could've sworn you said something nasty just now... I'll pretend like I didn't hear anything, but just this once.
#823$#If you want to keep talking, you should watch what you say.|
98086|#824$#Okay? I'm the only one who's allowed to criticize her.
#821$#Ouch! Easy, easy! I admit I went too far.|
98087|I heard you call Amaterasu 'sister'...?|
98088|#821$#Huh? Me? Wh-why are you asking this all of a sudden?|
98089|#824$#Eh? What's that? Are you saying you want to be my sister?
#823$#Ouch. It'd be impossible anyway. I'll make you regret ever entertaining such a silly thought.|
98090|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98091|#821$#I haven't thought about that for some time.
#824$#Um... Yeah, not thinking about it was definitely the right decision.|
98092|#821$#What? Do you not like the moonlight?
#824$#Oops. Unfortunately, you won't ever find anything quite as beautiful, I assure you.|
98093|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
98094|#821$#Hunting in the snow has long been my favorite thing to do in Ydalir.
#823$#... Have you ever been hunting? With me as your instructor, you'll come to love it just as much as I do.|
98095|#821$#I have many a fond memory of shaping yew branches into arrows by hand.
#823$#You may have seen me wield only a sword, but I assure you I'm a fine archer.|
98096|Changing seasons?|
98097|#821$#Nothing is more beautiful than land blanketed in freshly fallen snow.
#822$#Just as you see around me now.|
98098|#821$#I'm only truly comfortable in the cold.
#822$#It makes it easier to appreciate a human's temperature, no?|
98099|What type of communication objects do you have?|
98100|#821$#Every object is beautiful in its own right.
#822$#What matters most is making sure your sincerity reaches the right person.
#823$#As a knight, I refuse to let any woman come to harm.|
98101|#821$#I wonder what type you are. Can you guess which type is my favorite...?|
98102|What's your definition of a friend?|
98103|#821$#A friend is someone willing to open their heart to you.
#822$#They in turn are sensitive to your own heart, especially when it's feeling lonely.
#823$#I sensed these very feelings myself.|
98104|#823$#From a friend, you ask? Yes, though you and I are more than simply friends.|
98105|Do you like me?|
98106|#823$#Haha! Of course! Is there anyone lovelier in the world than you?|
98107|#823$#If you don't understand my words, allow me to show you with actions.|
98108|Do you like to fight?|
98109|#821$#Knights fight not for fun but for a purpose.
#823$#As such a purpose, you should already understand.|
98110|#821$#Fighting out of fear and ego is slaughter. Fighting for faith is true battle.
#822$#My faith is you, as you stand before me now.|
98111|Is there anywhere you'd like to go?|
98112|#821$#I'm told that it snows all year round on Frigga Peak.
#822$#The icicles and snow crystals are legendary. Shall we go see it together someday?
#823$#Are you worried about feeling cold? You needn't. After all, I'll be there with you.|
98113|#821$#Despite the name, the Glacial Ice Cavern has sweeping palace steps.
#822$#It's not all that different from Ydalir Palace, which I'd be honored to show you sometime.|
98114|Tell me about Quests.|
98115|#821$#When others need help, you can read related message on the map.
#822$#Some of the commissions are actually quite dangerous.|
98116|#821$#But worry not. I vowed to protect you, remember?
#822$#Just as it's your mission to help people solve problems, it's mine to protect you.|
98117|Do you know about the trading point?|
98118|#821$#It's a place where people from all over can trade.
#823$#Is there something you want? I'll do my best to offer it to you.|
98119|#821$#As for thigs you don't want, you can always sell them at the trading point for money.
#822$#But who you are is worth infinitely more to me than that.|
98120|About the Eidolons' Oath.|
98121|#821$#I'm told it's a solemn vow between two close friends...
#823$#Haha! Did that make you feel shy? Then I'll patiently wait for the day you're ready.|
98122|#821$#I firmly believe in the words spoken in promise.
#2$#'Will you make this sacred oath with me?'|
98123|Are you the god of winter and snow?|
98124|#821$#When winter comes, the world becomes my domain.
#823$#I swear that no harm will come to you under my protection.|
98125|#821$#When the world comes to winter, I bring snow and cold to the earth.
#822$#But as much as I love caring for all things related to winter, what I most want to do...is care for you.|
98126|It's so cold next to you...|
98127|#821$#Is it? From the looks of your clothing, it's no wonder.
#822$#Come, wrap my cloak around you, and allow me the honor of keeping you warm.|
98128|#821$#Um... As lord of all of winter, a chill will naturally follow me wherever I go.
#822$#Even so, I don't think I could bear staying away from you.
#823$#Still not feeling warm yet? Shall I wrap my arms around you instead? They're warmer than any cloak.|
98129|Those ice crystals on your shoulder look sharp...|
98130|#821$#More than that, their power causes frostbite when touched.
#822$#But... No need to worry. I won't hurt you.|
98131|#821$#Um... Still, I'd rather not take any risks...
#823$#Since the crystals are on the left and my blade is on the right, all the better that you stand in front of me so I can admire you more easily.|
98132|What is Ydalir?|
98133|#821$#It's the land where I've lived for many years. It's known far and wide for its yew woodlands.
#822$#And for its cold temperatures. If you want to go there, you'll need to take care to stay warm.
#823$#Although, even if you go alone, I won't let you freeze.|
98134|#821$#There are beautiful ice lakes and endless groves of yew trees marking solemn places all year round.
#822$#I built a palace there and made it my home.
#823$#... I hope someday that palace will have your trace.|
98135|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98136|#821$#Gossip, you say? Well, Hel's relationship with Bealdor remains strained... Ah, never mind. Please forget I said anything.
#822$#I only hope that my brother...can stop grieving.|
98137|#821$#Haha! Bealdor and I? We're close friends.
#823$#He may come across as a mother's boy, but he's also very reliable at critical moments.|
98138|Are you a good friend of Bealdor's?|
98139|#821$#He and I are two sides of the same coin, the divine light shining on the horizon and the northern aurora streaming at night.
#823$#He and I have spoken together about everything and nothing.|
98140|#821$#Our bond is like that of brothers. To call Bealdor a mere friend would not do him justice.
#823$#Um... What is this look you're giving me? Our relationship also exceeds friendship.|
98141|I hear you have a lot of female fans?|
98142|#821$#I'm afraid I can't speak to that. All women are lovely in their own special way.
#822$#It's an honor and a pleasure to receive their love.|
98143|#823$#... Could it be that you're jealous? I hope you'll forgive me for feeling happy about that.
#824$#Whatever you've heard, know this: your knight will never betray you.|
98144|What about your bow and arrows?|
98145|#821$#I often hunted with a bow carved from purple wood in Ydalir.
#823$#But to protect those important to me, I gladly took up a sword instead.
#822$#When faced with danger, I'll always be there to stand before you.|
98146|#821$#It seems you've done your research. The yew bow is my weapon of choice when hunting in the valley.
#823$#But in order to protect those important to me, I did my knight's duty and took up the sword. I can't say I regret the decision one bit.|
98147|Your weapon is awesome!|
98148|#821$#And you have excellent taste. This blade is the Millennium Ice Sword.
#822$#It turns all it touches to ice.
#823$#It's a fine weapon worthy of protecting someone as important as you.|
98149|#823$#Long ago, Bealdor and I made up our minds to take up swords to protect those we cherish.
#822$#This blade may be extremely cold, but the heart that wishes to protect you is warm.|
98150|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98151|#821$#If separation is your decision, I will respect it.
#822$#Just know that someone in the distance will always be thinking of you.|
98152|#821$#Haha. What a sad question you've asked me... What can I do for your departure?
#822$#It is only in a winter sky that you're left with such a beautiful view of the aurora. Let's gaze upon in together.|
98153|Do you like Halloween?|
98154|#823$#If you like it, you can have fun with others.
#822$#People feel less inhibited when they're wearing costumes, right?|
98155|#822$#Halloween is a one big fun, tasty party!
#821$#Haha! But all that fun makes me tired... I could really go for a nap...zzzz...|
98156|What will happen on Halloween?|
98157|#822$#I heard that a bunch of monsters come out on Halloween night, like ghosts, witches, skeletons...
#823$#Shh! This is a secret! You'll keep it right, Master?|
98158|#822$#There will be many Jack O'Lanterns on Halloween.
#823$#The light of the Jack O'Lanterns will shine on things that you can't usually see.|
98159|Is nighttime busier than the daytime?|
98160|#822$#On Halloween night, everyone will dress up.
#823$#Let's light the Jack O'Lantern and play around. Let's go and check it out.|
98161|#821$#Haha! Halloween night is very noisy... I... I could still fall asleep, though...
#821$#Hey... As long as there is a warm and comfortable big quilt, I will be ok.|
98162|In which season does Halloween fall?|
98163|#822$#That's an easy one! Everyone knows it happens in autumn.
#821$#Haha! A cooler temperature is best for sleeping...|
98164|#823$#Um? What season? Just like bears, people sleep best in the wintertime.
#821$#Haha! Why are you asking this?|
98165|What's your favorite food?|
98166|#823$#Endora was just telling me about delicious toffee apples for Halloween.
#825$#A whole apple is dunked in warm, melty toffee. Sounds like a bad idea. People will just end up getting toffee all over their faces!|
98167|#822$#Hey, speaking of Halloween, it's the festival of pumpkins!
#821$#Do you know if there are huge pumpkins, so that people can eat them and sleep in them?|
98168|Where do you want to spend Halloween?|
98169|#822$#I heard that there are tree demons with faces like Jack O'Lanterns in Chronology Forest.
#825$#Aw, but that's pretty far away, isn't it? Um... All the better for Master to go!
#821$#Haha! I'll stay here and, uh, watch over the bed.|
98170|#822$#Haha! There's no place like home, as they say!
#823$#We will clean the house and give it a Halloween atmosphere.
#821$#When you get tired of playing, you can immediately fall back to your bed and sleep.|
98171|Let's go to Navea and take a look!|
98172|#821$#Haha! Is Master strong enough to carry another person?
#821$#Yawn... Home... So...sleepy... Zzzzz...|
98173|#822$#Haha! Navea must be buzzing with fun stuff this time of year.
#823$#Master should hold my hand to avoid getting lost, okay?|
98174|Transmitting Information.|
98175|#823$#I want to write Halloween party invitations and send them out to everyone.
#825$#Eh, but... Master... How do you spell 'Halloween'?|
98176|#822$#Who will you write to, Master? I'll deliver the letters for you, no problem.
#823$#Magic Broom and I are your personal courier service!|
98177|Do you know about the trading point?|
98178|#822$#Oh, I know! It's a place where anyone and everyone can sell things!
#824$#Master, just what do you plan to do with that candy? Hey! Bad Master, bad! These candies were from other people!|
98179|#822$#If you want something, candy or otherwise, you can find it at the Exchange.
#823$#Maybe you could buy me a warm, cozy quilt?|
98180|Tell me about magical magic.|
98181|#822$#Magical magic can do anything!
#823$#I want to conjure a big, fluffy quilt!
#821$#Haha! Why else? To roll up in and go to sleep!|
98182|#823$#As a Young Hex, I can perform magical magic!
#822$#Anything Master wants, I can make.
#824$#Huh? A pile of money? Uh, well... Um... Let's come up with something else.|
98183|Trick or Treat!|
98184|#824$#Hey... That's supposed to be my line!
#824$#Which reminds me, we're plumb out of candy... Oh no! Does that mean you'll trick me by stealing my quilt?|
98185|#822$#Trick or treat without sugar?!
#823$#The Master has to give people a lot of candy, or else people might do horrible things to Master!|
98186|Let's make Jack O'Lanterns together.|
98187|#822$#Speaking of that, Orbie has been dressed up as a Jack O'Lantern.
#823$#Master, we should carve the biggest Jack O'Lantern there ever was!|
98188|#822$#I've got a nice, big pumpkin right here. Whatever Master carves on it will look loveliest.
#825$#¡K¡K¡K
#821$#Haha! The Jack O'Lantern is almost finished... So sleepy...|
98189|Were you going to prank me just now?|
98190|#822$#Haha! It looks very interesting! Master is coming back to tell us how interesting it is.
#821$#Haha! That's what they say... I'll just nest in my quilt until then... How do you feel about quilt pranks?|
98191|#825$#A Halloween trick is supposed to be a prank to get a little rise out of someone...
#824$#Um... But if someone were to steal my quilt while I'm asleep... I'd be furious!|
98192|Are you afraid of ghosts?|
98193|#821$#Zzzz... Snort! Someone say something?
#825$#Oh, it's just you, Master. I thought it was the child on your shoulder.|
98194|#825$#Ghost to ghost? What is a ghost?
#822$#Um? Are you a floating being? So how to say it? There seem to be a few floating behind Master.|
98195|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98196|#821$#Haha! Halloween is when Endora really shines!
#825$#She has this one trick where she puts out a bunch of pumpkins on the road...
#821$#As for me... I just want to sleep. Guess that's not really gossipworthy, though.|
98197|#825$#On Halloween Night you might catch Aoandon floating around somewhere.
#825$#Um... It also sounds like everyone's got a ghost story or two to tell at the party.
#821$#Hm... We might need to blow out a few Jack O'Lanterns though... Too much light isn't good for sleeping...|
98198|What does Halloween mean to you?|
98199|#823$#Haha! It's an excuse to eat lots and lots of delicious candy!
#821$#Haha! Practically everyone loves candy. I like it too... I also like to sleep...|
98200|#823$#I love the idea of people dressing up in costumes to get candy!
#822$#Is that something you do, Master? I hear that only children do it.
#823$#It doesn't matter. I'll share whatever candy I have with you, costume or no.|
98201|You look lovely.|
98202|#822$#Haha! Well, I'm the Young Hex of Halloween after all!
#823$#I'm going to cast some special magic so that you and I will stay together always!|
98203|#825$#Endora was trying to teach it to me before I dozed off...
#821$#Haha! Say... Say... I think everyone should dress up on Halloween, not just children.|
98204|See? Orbie's now a pumpkin!|
98205|#822$#I think it's a good look on you, Orbie. Very cute!
#825$#Hey... But I guess this means that you shouldn't drink any pumpkin juice at the party.|
98206|#822$#Why? It'd be too sad for Orbie!
#823$#Master, let's go and play with Orbie a bit, hmm?|
98207|A lamp floating next to it?|
98208|#823$#Haha! This lamp is Endora's creation.
#822$#Master, do you think it looks good to wear other people's clothes?|
98209|#825$#Endora said that the light at night will create a Halloween atmosphere.
#821$#Ha ha... But I don't like having lights on while I am sleeping...|
98210|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98211|#821$#Hey, what kind of question is this? Does Master have to go home?
#824$#Is it because... I'm always dozing off...?
#824$#Hey... The last time was ages ago!|
98212|#824$#No matter what... I will not be separated from Master!|
98213|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
98214|#821$#Teehee... Floret's favorite activity is viewing flowers...
#823$#Viewing the flowers from a high branch is the best thing in the world...|
98215|#821$#Do you want to view the flowers with Floret? This is Floret's favorite activity...
#823$#Floret can make beautiful flowers bloom all around...|
98216|Changing seasons?|
98217|#823$#Hee... Floret loves spring... The weather is wonderful and there are many beautiful flowers...
#821$#Why can't it be spring all year round...?|
98218|#821$#Every winter, Floret just wants to stay at home...
#824$#The cold just makes the flowers disappear... Floret doesn't like it!|
98219|What's your type?|
98220|#824$#Floret doesn't like people who judge others by appearances! People like that are no good!|
98221|#821$#Hmm... Sister will get angry if Floret is with others!
#823$#But you are special... You are not the same...|
98222|What's your dream?|
98223|#821$#Teehee... Floret's dream is... to fill the whole world with beautiful flowers...
#823$#Isn't this a great dream?! Surrounded by flowers everywhere...|
98224|#821$#Hmm... Floret has lots and lots of dreams...
#823$#And one of them is to stay with you forever and ever...!|
98225|What's your favorite food?|
98226|#823$#Sweet, sweet nectar! Fresh nectar is always the best...
#821$#Huh? You have never tasted fresh nectar before?
#823$#Let's find a large flowerbed... Floret will teach you how to eat the sweet nectar...|
98227|#823$#Teehee... Are you asking Floret... because you want to give Floret some food...?
#821$#Nnn... no? Hmm... nothing... Floret is not disappointed at all...|
98228|Is there anywhere you'd like to go?|
98229|#821$#Floret wants to visit the Bloom Altar! It's said to be famous for its flowers...
#823$#When can we go... Now?!|
98230|#821$#Hmm... As long as it is not as cold as winter, Floret wants to go for a visit...
#824$#Floret heard that people will become ice sculptures once they enter Frigga Peak... So Floret will absolutely not go there!|
98231|Tell me about the Guitar.|
98232|#821$#I heard that instruments can be a weapon...
#821$#Hmm... It looks like Brother Uriel's instrument...
#823$#If Floret has an instrument, Floret can join their band too, right?|
98233|#823$#Floret saw someone holding that weapon, and they had their own recital...
#821$#It looks really fun... Floret wants to try it too...|
98234|Do you know anything about the Sky Tower?|
98235|#821$#Hmm... Sky Tower... What kind of place is that?
#823$#If it's a beautiful place full of flowers... then Floret wants to go!|
98236|#821$#Hmm... Is it a special building? Is the Sky Tower very tall?
#823$#Teehee... Floret is not afraid of heights... Where Floret comes from there's a much taller building than that!|
98237|Do you know anything about Sanctuary Farm?|
98238|#823$#Teehee... Floret sneaked into it before...
#821$#There's many, many huge trees there... and even a large pool of water...
#823$#Floret wants to let the trees be filled with cherry blossoms... Is that ok?|
98239|#821$#There is a huge flowerbed next to Sanctuary Farm...
#823$#Teehee... Floret can stay there all day long...|
98240|You look really cute.|
98241|#821$#Hee... Thank you... Many people have said that Floret is cute...
#823$#But somehow it means more coming from you...|
98242|#823$#Floret is so happy... People often say that Floret is as lovely as flowers...
#821$#Hmm... But how come there are no petals on Floret's face?|
98243|Your weapon looks really special.|
98244|#821$#Hmm? Are you talking about Sakura? Sakura is a beautiful weapon made from cherry blossoms...
#821$#Sister gave it a name... Hmm... it's called "Sakura Bud"!
#823$#Hee... But Floret still likes to call it Sakura...|
98245|#823$#Sakura you're the best! Swish, swish... and it can produce a large and beautiful cherry blossom...
#821$#Teehee... Because Sakura is the spirit of the cherry blossom...|
98246|What are Flower Tales?|
98247|#821$#Floret knows! Floret knows!
#823$#Flower Tales have a symbolic meaning...
#821$#Like Floret's favorite cherry blossom, there are different meanings depending on the species!|
98248|#823$#Flower Tales are a symbolic thing given to flowers...
#821$#"Life" is cherry blossoms' Flower Tales, and it's also Floret's favorite flower...
#823$#Hee... If there's anything you don't know, Floret can tell you more about it!|
98249|I heard that you're a flower goddess?|
98250|#821$#Flower goddess? Hmm... Floret seems to have heard this word before...
#823$#Hee... But Floret has forgotten... Are flower goddesses powerful?|
98251|#821$#What is a flower goddess? If it's not fun... then Floret doesn't want it...
#823$#... Can it play with the flowers? Wow... Then Floret wants to be a flower goddess...!|
98252|Floret is such a lovely name.|
98253|#823$#Teehee... Sister often calls Floret this...
#821$#You can also call Floret like that... We'll be closer...|
98254|#823$#Do you want Floret to call you something special too? Spit it out!
#821$#Master... Dear... Little Bo... Hmm... Floret feels uncomfortable...
#823$#Floret has decided! Let's just continue with the current names!|
98255|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98256|#821$#Floret loves to nestle up to Sister Sif while looking at the flowers...
#823$#Sister Sif has a very nice paddy rice fragrance...
#821$#But... If anyone accidentally touches Sister Sif's hair, Sister Sif will become really scary...|
98257|#823$#Floret loves to plant flowers while talking with Sister Demeter...
#824$#Sister Demeter is just like Floret. We hate winter the most!
#821$#Hmm... But winter seems to mean something different to Sister Demeter.|
98258|I heard you have a sister?|
98259|#821$#Floret has a sister! But Sister is very shy, and she hardly ever comes out...
#824$#No one has seen Sister, yet they say Sister is ugly... Hmmph... Sister is not ugly!|
98260|#823$#Hee... Floret like Sister the most... Floret often drinks tea and views flowers together with Sister!
#821$#Hmm... Floret suddenly misses Sister...|
98261|Do you like flowers?|
98262|#823$#Yes! Floret likes flowers the most......
#821$#Teehee... No matter what the flower is called, Floret knows them all!|
98263|#821$#In this world, Floret loves Sister and flowers the most!
#823$#Huh... Are these flowers for Floret? Wow... Floret likes you the most too...!|
98264|Do you know Grandpa Bloom?|
98265|#823$#Floret used to like playing with Grandpa...
#821$#As long as Floret makes the trees full of beautiful cherry blossoms, everyone will laugh and be happy...|
98266|#821$#Floret knows! Grandpa and Grandma live in a remote village...
#822$#When everyone dances together, under the tree covered in cherry blossoms, it all feels perfect...
#821$#Hmm... But Floret hasn't seen Grandpa since... Where did he go?|
98267|Your dress is really beautiful.|
98268|#823$#Teehee... This is Floret's favorite dress...
#821$#Huh? Like a fairy? Hmm... What is a fairy?
#823$#If there's lots of flowers... Floret wants to become a fairy too...|
98269|#823$#Sister said if Floret puts on this dress, Floret will become a flower too!
#821$#Hmm... But Floret is still Floret... Why didn't Floret become a flower...
#821$#Huh? You mean I won't actually become a flower? I see... So Floret can't become a flower...|
98270|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98271|#821$#Huh...? You don't like Floret anymore...
#824$#Then, then Floret will stop liking you too! Hmm... Floret is serious!|
98272|#824$#If you say that again... Floret won't be your friend anymore!
#824$#Hmmph... Hate, hate, hate!|
98273|Do you believe in Santa Claus?|
98274|#821$#Of course I do!
#821$#I've seen Santa Claus in plenty of books!|
98275|#821$#Santa Claus is a chubby old man in red clothes!
#822$#Hmm? I haven't seen him in person, but he looks like that in the books!
#824$#Are you saying you don't believe in him?|
98276|Do you like Christmas?|
98277|#821$#I love how crowded the streets get during Christmas!
#822$#Beautiful shimmering lights everywhere,
#821$#I'd like to spend Christmas with my prince charming, dancing through the decorations.|
98278|#821$#Christmas is a time for everyone to get together and celebrate!
#822$#Being with my master makes me happy!|
98279|Christmas feast?|
98280|#821$#Leave the Christmas feast to me!
#822$#I used to help the dwarves prepare dinner.
#821$#They did always seem a bit green after eating though...|
98281|#821$#Master, I found a great Christmas cake recipe!
#822$#I'll try it out and include it in the feast if it's good!
#821$#Trial number 24, this one is sure to be it!|
98282|Do you want to send Christmas cards?|
98283|#821$#I don't like to write, can I just draw with crayons?
#823$#I need a big white piece of paper that I can draw Christmas decorations on!
#821$#It's not going to fit in the mailbox, is it? Looks like we need a bigger mailbox!|
98284|#821$#I have to send these cards to the dwarves, little lambs, little wolves, and of course...
#822$#My beloved master!|
98285|Let's sing "Silent Night" together.|
98286|#821$#I used to sing in the forest...
#822$#Animals would come from all around to hear it!
#821$#I wonder what friends I'll make this time.|
98287|#822$#I love singing more than anything!
#821$#I haven't heard this song before, can you teach it to me?|
98288|How to decorate the Christmas Tree?|
98289|#821$#I want to sprinkle snow on the tree, white trees are the prettiest!
#823$#Then I'll hang apples all over it.
#824$#What? You can't do that? Who says you can't put apples on a Christmas Tree?|
98290|#822$#Leave the Christmas Tree decorations to me!
#821$#I've seen plenty of them in the picture books.
#823$#Our Christmas Tree will look splendid!|
98291|Impressions of Christmas?|
98292|#821$#Hmm, impressions? Let me see...
#824$#I can't really remember...|
98293|#822$#I remember Christmas being a time for presents.
#821$#I've prepared a gift for you.
#823$#All this candy is for you, master!|
98294|Let's enjoy Christmas in the city!|
98295|#821$#Are you taking me out to play?
#822$#I want to spend every holiday with you!|
98296|#821$#It's been a long time since I've been in the city.
#823$#I heard it's shiny and beautiful everywhere during Christmas, I really want to have a look.|
98297|Transmitting Information.|
98298|#821$#Letters? Can I send one to Santa Claus?
#823$#I have tons of things to tell him!
#822$#Of course I'll include my Christmas wish list!|
98299|#822$#I love writing letters, my favorite part is drawing cute pictures on the paper with crayons!
#821$#I'm done! Here's a letter for Santa Claus, and one for you, master.|
98300|Do you want Christmas presents?|
98301|#821$#I heard only good kids get Christmas presents,
#822$#that means I should get a ton of them!
#823$#Aren't I such a good kid?|
98302|#822$#I want lots of presents!
#821$#Story books, apple desserts and a prince charming would be a good start!
#824$#Huh? Prince charming isn't a present? Hmm, why not?|
98303|What a cute look.|
98304|#821$#Do you like it? I spent a long time choosing this outfit!
#822$#A white dress is perfect for Christmas, it looks just like winter snow!|
98305|#822$#I want to look my best when we celebrate Christmas together.
#821$#I borrowed these bells from a Christmas Tree... Hmm? I shouldn't take them?|
98306|Had any Christmas experiences before?|
98307|#824$#I can't really remember...
#821$#Any time I try to recall, my head starts to hurt.
#824$#I'm not forgetful!|
98308|#821$#I remember there's a huge tree...
#823$#There are lots of shimmering, glittering objects on the tree...
#822$#And there's a huge table covered with delicious food!
#821$#That's Christmas, right?|
98309|Christmas Sleigh?|
98310|#822$#I got it! You can go so fast on the snow with a sleigh!
#821$#Adorable Reindeer pull it so fast!|
98311|#821$#Santa Claus flies his sleigh through the sky delivering presents at top speed!
#822$#I'm so smart! It's all in the picture books.|
98312|Let's build a snowman!|
98313|#822$#I love building snowmen!
#821$#We need two big snowballs to get the snowman started!|
98314|#822$#I'm so good at this! Do you want to race?
#821$#Wow, you're much faster that I thought...
#823$#No way! Snowball attack! Hehe, was that cold?|
98315|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98316|#821$#Do you know who else dressed up for Christmas?
#822$#It's little Ayako and Tyr! They're spend so much time together!
#823$#I dressed in this special outfit to celebrate Christmas with everyone!|
98317|#822$#Did you know that Eirene was born during a great winter snowstorm?
#821$#Just like me! I was born on a snowy winter day too!|
98318|Celebrate Christmas with a family?|
98319|#824$#I used to love celebrating with my family, but that's not possible now...
#821$#I'm fine... I have Master with me now, I'm not lonely anymore.|
98320|#824$#Sometimes I still miss my parents...
#824$#If only the stars could grant me my wish...|
98321|Do you like snow?|
98322|#821$#I love snowy winter days the most!
#822$#The cold snowflakes feel so nice on your skin.|
98323|#821$#Did you know that I was born on a snowy winter day?
#822$#That's probably why I love the feeling of snow so much.|
98324|Let's host a Christmas party!|
98325|#823$#I love parties!
#821$#That sounds like so much fun!|
98326|#821$#Are Christmas parties the same as other parties?
#822$#I used to attend royal gatherings.
#824$#I never really liked those parties though, everyone seemed to be pretending to be nice...|
98327|Let's confirm the invitation list for the Christmas party.|
98328|#823$#I want to invite all my friends!
#821$#The little forest animals, the dwarves, and...|
98329|#822$#Can I be in charge of the guest list?
#821$#I want to invite little lamb, little wolf, and...
#823$#We need to make enough scrumptious apple pie for everyone!|
98330|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98331|#824$#Are you trying to get rid of me during Christmas?
#824$#Boooooo... Boooooo...|
98332|#824$#No, I haven't thought about it!
#824$#You shouldn't be thinking about it either!|
98333|Do you believe in Santa Claus?|
98334|#821$#Of course!
#823$#I want Santa Claus to bring me lots of presents!
#822$#Haha! Don't forget about me!|
98335|#821$#Of course I believe in Santa Claus!
#823$#You are my Santa Claus, master!|
98336|Do you like Christmas?|
98337|#821$#I'll get so many presents for Christmas!
#821$#I can eat all sorts of delicious food with Ches!
#823$#Christmas is my favorite!|
98338|#821$#As long as I get to spend it with Master and Ches,
#823$#however we celebrate is fine by me!|
98339|Christmas feast?|
98340|#821$#First I'll have some fresh salad, then some roasted chicken,
#823$#then as many delicious desserts as I can grab, followed by some nice hot tea...
#822$#Do you think that will be enough?|
98341|#823$#I love desserts the most!
#821$#There's nothing better than dessert and a nice pot of tea.
#822$#This Christmas feast will be perfect with you and Ches!|
98342|Do you want to send Christmas cards?|
98343|#821$#Christmas cards? I've never written one before...
#822$#Oh, that's how humans send Christmas greetings!
#823$#Let's write some together, Ches!|
98344|#821$#We can write them for Hansel, Master, and...
#822$#Haha! Do you really love this little wolf?
#824$#No way! Don't spout nonsense, Ches!|
98345|Let's sing "Silent Night" together.|
98346|#821$#Hmm, I've never heard this song before.
#823$#Why don't you sing it for us?|
98347|#821$#We have to sing during the Christmas tea party?
#823$#Sounds like a great idea!
#821$#Ches, let's see what little creatures we can find to practice with!|
98348|How to decorate the Christmas Tree?|
98349|#821$#Alice loves fanciful decorations!
#823$#We have to fill the tree with the shiniest decorations.
#823$#The bottom of the tree should be completely covered by presents for me!|
98350|#821$#What type of decorations do you like on your Christmas Tree?
#823$#As long as I get to decorate a Christmas Tree with you,
#823$#I'm fine with any type!|
98351|Impressions of Christmas?|
98352|#823$#The feasting is my favorite!
#822$#Haha! Alice has quite an appetite!
#821$#Don't spout nonsense, Ches! Don't listen to Ches!|
98353|#821$#Hmm, I'd like to be with my favorite person during winter...
#823$#cuddled up by a fire sharing a Christmas feast!
#823$#We can pass the time as we wait for Santa Claus to bring us presents!|
98354|Let's enjoy Christmas in the city!|
98355|#821$#Did you know that during Christmas in Port Skandia
#823$#they set up a huge Christmas Tree? We should go check it out!|
98356|#821$#Have you considered...
#821$#Inviting other friends to celebrate Christmas with us?
#823$#I meant Hansel and Gretel!|
98357|Transmitting Information.|
98358|#822$#Instead of writing letters, I prefer face to face interactions!
#823$#It's better if I can hear your voice in person.
#821$#I don't know what to say... I'll tell you when I know!|
98359|#823$#Who is Master going to write to? I want letters from Master too!
#821$#Hmm, I don't understand what's written on this...
#825$#Maybe you should spend your energy on something else, haha!|
98360|What do you want for Christmas?|
98361|#821$#Hmm, what do I want?
#825$#I want master's Gaia... Haha!
#822$#The perfect present would be staying with you forever...|
98362|#821$#Christmas presents... Let me think...
#825$#Will you give it to me? Your Gaia!
#822$#I'm just kidding while I think of presents...|
98363|What a cute look.|
98364|#821$#Do you like my new outfit?
#823$#Perfect, then I'll keep it!|
98365|#823$#Really, you like this too?
#821$#It's such a great design for Christmas.
#823$#Ches helped out a lot!|
98366|Is Christmas celebrated in Wonderland?|
98367|#821$#There's winter in Wonderland...
#821$#But we never celebrated Christmas there...
#823$#Christmas in Wonderland sounds like a great idea!|
98368|#821$#No one would know what it meant...
#821$#But I'm happy just being with my favorite person for Christmas...
#823$#Maybe every day is Christmas for me!|
98369|Christmas Sleigh?|
98370|#821$#I'd love to ride on a sleigh like Santa Claus!
#824$#Hmm, we can't use a sleigh without Reindeer?
#823$#We have rabbits, cats, mice, and Ches though!|
98371|#822$#There's nothing quite like this in Wonderland...
#821$#Ches, do you want to ride in a sleigh too?
#823$#Let's borrow a sleigh from Santa Claus!|
98372|Let's build a snowman!|
98373|#823$#Let's have a snowman building competition!
#821$#We can see who can build the biggest, prettiest snowman!
#822$#I'll be the judge!|
98374|#821$#Hebe is really good at building snowmen!
#823$#Let's go look for Hebe!
#821$#Maybe she can teach us her special techniques!|
98375|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98376|#821$#There seems to be a little pal with Muramasa now...
#823$#Ches, we should go meet her new friend sometime soon!
#822$#I heared Muramasa's partner is pretty strong.|
98377|#821$#Seems like Lumikki has changed into a Christmas outfit.
#821$#Does that mean Hansel will wear something cool too?
#823$#I can't wait to celebrate Christmas with Hansel!|
98378|Celebrate Christmas with a family?|
98379|#821$#My family is Master, Ches, rabbits, cats, and mice!
#823$#It's the best feeling when everyone is together.|
98380|#821$#I celebrated Christmas with Ches in Terra before.
#822$#We nearly destroyed a castle after drinking some bubbly drinks.
#821$#Hmm, really? I can't remember.|
98381|Do you like snow?|
98382|#821$#Well, it's cold and pretty at the same time.
#821$#I don't know if I like it or not.|
98383|#821$#I do know that some wicked people, like the Queen of Hearts, live in snowy places!
#821$#You have to be really careful!
#822$#But someone strong like you shouldn't worry.|
98384|Let's host a Christmas party!|
98385|#823$#I love tea parties! We can devour desserts together!
#821$#We should prepare some Christmas themed food. And we can decorate the table too.
#822$#Wow, we have a lot to do.|
98386|#823$#This will be the first Christmas party we host together!
#823$#I'll get to work making sweets and roasted chicken.
#821$#Speaking of sweets... Maybe I should ask Gretel for help.|
98387|Please have a look at the guest list.|
98388|#821$#I want to invite rabbits, cats and mice!
#823$#They're always great tea party guests.
#821$#Christmas tea parties should be even more lavish than normal ones!|
98389|#821$#Hansel, Gretel and Lumikki should definitely be on the list.
#822$#The first person that comes to your mind is that little wolf?
#821$#That's not true, don't say that Ches!|
98390|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98391|#821$#Hmm, if you're going to leave...
#825$#I want master's Gaia... Haha!
#822$#Heehee... I can't bear to part with you.|
98392|#823$#I heard that there's lots of magic energy to gather during Christmas.
#821$#Does that mean you'll be even more powerful? If that's the case, I'll never leave you!
#822$#I'll get stronger right along side you, Master!|
98393|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
98394|#821$#Did you know that children love candy?
#823$#I've been doing lots of research on how to make it.
#821$#I haven't figured out the perfect recipe yet... Why should I tell a peasant like you?|
98395|#821$#I like making ice sculptures during my spare time, my palace is filled with them.
#823$#You think the ice sculptures look like lost villagers? You must be mistaken.|
98396|Changing seasons?|
98397|#824$#I detest summer, even the word itself annoys me.|
98398|#821$#There aren't four seasons from where I come from, it's just one eternal winter.|
98399|What's your type?|
98400|#821$#Someone not like you.
#823$#Did I hurt your feelings?|
98401|#821$#I have yet to meet someone capable of stealing my heart.
#823$#You? You're definitely special, but not my type at all.|
98402|What's your favorite food?|
98403|#821$#I tried something called shaved ice once.
#823$#It's little slivers of ice drenched with syrup and covered in fruit.
#821$#I could barely believe something so delicious could exist in the human world.|
98404|#821$#There's nothing more delicious than frozen treats.
#823$#Not even the youngest pure soul...|
98405|Have you ever felt lonely?|
98406|#824$#How dare you ask me that!|
98407|#824$#Keep your nose where it belongs, peasant...|
98408|Is there anywhere you'd like to go?|
98409|#821$#I only like cold places, especially those too cold for most people to survive.
#823$#Frigga Peak? Sounds like a nice place, take me there some time.|
98410|#821$#I heard that the Glacial Ice Cavern is so cold even Demons won't approach it.
#823$#It would be fun to bring humans there.|
98411|Tell me about the Guitar.|
98412|#821$#Do you want to learn an instrument?
#823$#I like the idea of you learning a new way to entertain me.|
98413|#821$#I heard that instrument harbors immense magical powers.
#821$#I wonder if my snowman band is stronger?|
98414|Auction?|
98415|#821$#I heard that's where peasants do their trading.
#821$#Nothing I would be interested in anyway...|
98416|#823$#You want to buy me something?
#821$#Haha, you can't afford what I desire.|
98417|Related to fishing|
98418|#821$#Everywhere I go freezes solid, that's why I've never been fishing.
#822$#You're asking the wrong person about that.|
98419|#821$#Do you want to go fishing with me in the Glacial Ice Cavern?
#822$#I'm afraid you're asking the wrong person.|
98420|Do you know about the magic mirror?|
98421|#821$#Ah, the mirror that shows the darkness in whatever is in front of it.
#822$#I wonder what it will show when it's placed in front of you.|
98422|#821$#You mean that terrible mirror?
#823$#Everything turns ugly in its reflection. Do you want to try it out?
#821$#Pity, I broke it a long time ago.|
98423|Have you smashed a magical mirror before?|
98424|#821$#So what if I have?
#824$#Do I have to report my every move?|
98425|#821$#It showed the depths of my heart,
#824$#no one is allowed to see that.
#821$#So I smashed it to bits.|
98426|I heard you once kidnapped a boy.|
98427|#824$#Kidnap? What an ugly word.
#821$#Every child comes to me willingly.
#824$#That look on your face is annoying me.|
98428|#821$#Peasants like you are so bothersome.
#823$#I've never forced a child to follow, they always choose it themselves.
#821$#Temptation? You mean like sweet candy and treats?|
98429|Where did you live before now?|
98430|#821$#At the edge of the Silent Ice Field, in a palace made of ice crystals.
#824$#Someone like you has no right to step foot near my palace.|
98431|#821$#I used my incredible power to make the perfect palace in the Silent Ice Field.
#823$#I made the most magnificent flight of crystal stairs to connect the two halves of it.
#822$#Where is the palace? Why do you want to know? Let's see how you do today.|
98432|Do you remember dealing with a pair of best friends?|
98433|#824$#Of course, they wanted to melt me in an oven.
#821$#Those insolent children deserved their punishment.
#823$#Keeping them apart was the cruelest punishment I could think of.|
98434|#821$#They paid a grave price for their little stunt.
#823$#It delighted me to my core to see how they suffered when they were separated.|
98435|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98436|#821$#I have been close friends with Elizabeth for many years.
#823$#We have similar interests... What interests?
#821$#Only another royal would understand.|
98437|#823$#Hansel from the Gruesome Twosome is really cute...
#824$#What are you looking at... Elizabeth was never this rude when we talked about it.
#821$#I should stop talking to people that don't share the same interests.|
98438|Do you like watching others suffer?|
98439|#823$#Do you know how exciting it is?
#821$#The fear that creeps across their face when they're completely helpless...|
98440|#821$#Both Elizabeth and I love it, I guess it's a royalty thing.
#823$#I'd like to see you suffer too.|
98441|Do you have friends?|
98442|#824$#Leave me be.|
98443|#821$#My friendships are of no concern to you.|
98444|Can you control snow and ice?|
98445|#821$#I have always had this ability.
#823$#I can freeze anything, including human hearts.|
98446|#821$#I can summon a blizzard so large it would freeze everything on earth.
#823$#There are a lot of beautiful ice sculptures in the palace, what's inside them? Heh... What do you think?|
98447|Do you like me?|
98448|#1$#¡K¡K
#821$#How awful...|
98449|#824$#Keep your nose where it belongs, peasant...
#821$#Stop talking right now if you want to stay at your current temperature.|
98450|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98451|#821$#Are you are planning on leaving me?|
98452|#824$#Part ways? You have no right to suggest that.
#821$#I will decide when we part ways.|
98453|What do you usually do?|
98454|#821$#Hmm... Are you talking to me?
#822$#I... I... *sniff*... I don't know what to say...|
98455|#821$#Usually, with my Little Flower...
#822$#I... I... *sniff*... We cook together, I watch Little Flower dance beautifully...
#821$#Don't look at me like that.|
98456|What does happiness mean?|
98457|#822$#Happiness...?
#821$#With my Little Flower... I'm happy doing anything.|
98458|#822$#But making new friends would be so good...
#821$#Hmm? Master, will you accompany me?
#823$#This... It's happiness...|
98459|You seem like you panic easily.|
98460|#822$#Panic?
#822$#No... I... I'm just a little nervous about people...
#822$#Is that bad? No, no... It's fine.|
98461|#822$#I... I... *sniff*... I just don't know what to do...
#822$#I won't be nervous...
#824$#Ah! I didn't mean to spill the tea...|
98462|What's your favorite season?|
98463|#821$#Mmm... Spring!
#823$#I'm so happy!|
98464|#821$#What do you like?
#822$#...Why? I would like to do something nice for you, Master.
#821$#Hmm? I... It comes from the bottom of my heart!|
98465|Recent goals.|
98466|#822$#I want to make new friends!
#821$#Huh? Huh? Of course it's important for me and you!|
98467|#821$#Little Flower, I have seen really beautiful flowers!
#823$#I want to embroider the flower... and give it to her.|
98468|Why are you standing so close?|
98469|#821$#Huh? Yes?
#822$#Ah! I'm sorry...
#822$#Is this too close? I...|
98470|#822$#I am not used to interact with other people.
#823$#I only feel safe with Little Flower.
#821$#Little Flower makes me feel so calm...
#823$#She's such a sweet child!|
98471|What do you think of public events?|
98472|#821$#Public events?
#822$#I've heard that there are a lot of people... I don't think I would like that...
#821$#But I could give it a try. Many people together...|
98473|#821$#A lot of people... In a public event...
#822$#I could make new friends...|
98474|Do you want to go anywhere?|
98475|#822$#I... I... *sniff*... I don't really like going out...
#822$#I don't like strangers...
#822$#Will this be a problem, master?|
98476|#821$#But Master is not a stranger.
#822$#I won't be scared, Master. I promise.|
98477|Do you know anything about forging and refining?|
98478|#821$#Refining? Are you... making equipments?
#822$#I... I... *sniff*... I am very good at embroiderying flowers and preparing tea...|
98479|#821$#I heard that the crafted equipment cannot be given to others...
#822$#So... I can't make it for Little Flower?|
98480|Housing?|
98481|#821$#It's your warm home.
#822$#If you're sick, hurt or feel like dreaming...
#823$#Back at home... I feel safe...|
98482|#821$#Does Master want to invite friends to our house?
#822$#I will hide then...
#822$#I don't get along with strangers...|
98483|You look really cute.|
98484|#823$#Really? Thank you!
#822$#Master, you're the second one to praise me like that.
#821$#Hmm? The first one? Little Flower, of course!|
98485|#824$#A lot of people say I'm ugly...
#822$#But I'm always home...No one has ever seen me...|
98486|Have you ever been in love?|
98487|#822$#No, no...They all said I was ugly...
#824$#But... Master and Little Flower would never let me down.|
98488|#822$#Being rejected must be hard.
#824$#I've never even seen my own face before...
#821$#Hmm? It's fine, I have you and Little Flower!|
98489|My sister.|
98490|#821$#Hmm? Are you talking about Little Flower?
#823$#I'm so glad she's my sister!|
98491|#821$#I don't look like Little Flower, but I've never felt sad about that.
#823$#Because she's my dear sister.|
98492|Any pet peeves?|
98493|#822$#No, I just don't like being alone with strangers...
#822$#Master, can you stay with me?|
98494|#821$#Little Flower is so cute...There are always lots of people around her...
#822$#When she is with me... I don't feel lonely.
#822$#Being alone is just a little...|
98495|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98496|#821$#Hansel and Gretel have never been apart...
#822$#Really? That's so good! I don't want to be apart from Little Flower!|
98497|#821$#Yukime is friendly but always sad...
#824$#Did anything happen?|
98498|Are you called the Goddess of Eternity?|
98499|#821$#I... I... *sniff*... I was named Iwanage-hime...
#822$#Because I can make life, life as resistent as a rock...
#821$#So! I will always protect you, Master!|
98500|#821$#There's also the notion of eternal life...
#822$#Do you want eternal life?|
98501|Do you like the same person as your sister?|
98502|#821$#Huh? Huh?
#822$#You?|
98503|#821$#My favorite people in the world are you, Master, and Little Flower...
#822$#... Does Little Flower like you too?|
98504|Are you a good fighter?|
98505|#822$#Well...
#822$#I fight better when I am accompanied...|
98506|#821$#Last time, a big wolf came over...
#822$#I was so scared that I closed my eyes but I swung my Umbrella Sakura with determination...
#822$#And the wolf ran away. Does it make me a good fighter?|
98507|Your umbrella?|
98508|#821$#Sakura?
#822$#Holding my Umbrella Sakura makes me feel so peaceful...
#822$#And if someone fights by my side, I feel stronger.|
98509|#821$#This umbrella is called Sakura.
#823$#It looks like Little Flower's weapon "Sakura Bud".
#822$#I named both weapons!
#823$#This way I feel closer to Little Flower.|
98510|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98511|#824$#Why are you leaving, Master?
#822$#Did I say something wrong?|
98512|#824$#Then... I will lock myself again.
#824$#And I will never go out...|
98513|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
98514|#822$#Hmm... Let's take a look at the past.
#821$#Much can be learned by looking at the past.|
98515|#822$#Whenever I look back, I feel so relaxed...
#823$#As time accumulates, new meanings begin to take shape.|
98516|Do you like books?|
98517|#823$#Of course! I'm especially fond of history books.
#822$#The past should be carefully recorded so that future generations will not forget it.|
98518|#821$#I once read under a tree for three days and two nights.
#823$#But books that tell any kinds of stories are always fascinating.|
98519|What's your type?|
98520|#822$#Hmm... Maybe someone who's gentle and thoughtful, and a bit nostalgic?
#823$#I hope it's someone who likes the past like me.|
98521|#822$#I like the way things get noticeably older over time.
#823$#I hope I can find someone who likes that too.|
98522|Are you a good fighter?|
98523|#822$#Huh? Are you underestimating me?
#823$#The power to control time should not be underestimated!|
98524|#821$#Most historical records are of mundane things like harvests and seasons...
#823$#But I'm pretty confident in battle.
#822$#After all, I've already seen the prophecy of the dawn. Hold on to your skirts and socks!|
98525|Do you feel lonely sometimes?|
98526|#822$#Looking back at history feels a bit lonely...
#822$#Will history be forgotten as time passes?|
98527|#822$#You know what? Compared with the present and the future... The past is the easiest to ignore.
#822$#Whenever I think of the past, as time goes by... I feel a bit sad.|
98528|Do you know White Spirit Hill?|
98529|#822$#Hmm... I've heard it's one of the Sprite homelands.
#823$#My own hometown has many Sprites, as well as other races.|
98530|#822$#I've heard that there are snow-like trees growing all over the place. It sounds beautiful.
#823$#Why don't we go take a look together?|
98531|Go check out Emerald Spring Peaks!|
98532|#822$#I'm looking forward to it. I wonder what kind of place it is...
#823$#The name makes me think of... a vivid green forest and crystal-clear spring water.|
98533|#822$#Let's go now!
#823$#I've heard Centaurs live there. I'm interested in their history.|
98534|Do you know the Eidolon Den?|
98535|#822$#You can put all your friends in one place.
#823$#It's like a happy big family in there.
#822$#Hmm... but what would happen if enemies lived together?|
98536|#822$#Your house is a great place for friends to rest.
#823$#If I had a bed, I'd lie down and rest.|
98537|What sort of things can you do at the Sanctuary?|
98538|#822$#You can fish and grow crops whenever you want.
#821$#I'll always have beautiful memories of my leisure activities!|
98539|#822$#If life gets too busy, why not head to the Sanctuary?
#823$#Let's relax and plant crops in the fields, dig in the mines, catch fish...|
98540|What is the Spring of Urd?|
98541|#823$#It's where my sister and I live, under the main root of the World Tree.
#822$#It's also where the gods gather to discuss things. I hear all sorts of important things here.|
98542|#821$#It's an essential water source for the World Tree.
#822$#Huh? Why's it named after me? Hmm... I'm not exactly sure.|
98543|What is the World Tree?|
98544|#822$#It's an absolutely enormous tree. Its branches span out endlessly and form the entire world!
#821$#Ha! My hometown is there too. Want to go check it out?|
98545|#821$#The World Tree supports our world, and has created nine other kingdoms too.
#822$#Hmm... but there's always a problem with the third root...|
98546|I heard you have two sisters.|
98547|#821$#Yes, I have two cute little sisters.
#823$#The one named Verdandi is in charge of the present time.
#822$#I'm still a master puppeteer, and a proud sister...|
98548|#821$#My two cute little sisters are always fighting.
#823$#The youngest is named Skuld, and is responsible for overseeing the future.
#822$#Hmm... but she's always so obsessed with future technology... It worries me a bit.|
98549|How do all you sisters get along?|
98550|#821$#We can be a pretty rowdy bunch, but we get along well.
#823$#I like my lovely sisters very much.|
98551|#822$#I don't know why Vera seems hostile to me.
#821$#I guess that's what you call adolescence, right? I understand!|
98552|I've never seen a weapon like that before.|
98553|#821$#Well... you noticed my beautiful staff?
#822$#My Temporal Staff can guide the flow of time. It's a very powerful weapon.|
98554|#821$#Time and space, guided by the Chamber of Time, are my precious weapons.
#822$#The Temporal Wand can also direct the flow of time. And the Chamber of Time can be turned back to the past.|
98555|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98556|#822$#Vicki has always loved playing pranks on others.
#821$#She may seem malicious, but I find her lovely.
#823$#Who's Vera? That's my sister Verdandi...|
98557|#822$#The Golden Apple that everyone covets is under the control of Idun.
#821$#This is the only thing that is not subject to time.|
98558|Is it called the Goddess of Death?|
98559|#821$#The past represents the passage of time. It's really the death of time, isn't it?
#822$#The world works only when death and birth repeat.|
98560|#822$#What's past is past... and the past is like a tomb where time goes to die.
#821$#Ha! That's why I'm the Goddess of Death, after all.|
98561|How do you feel about time?|
98562|#822$#The past, the present, and the future are the threads that create life.
#823$#Each aspect of time is important in its own way.|
98563|#822$#The accumulation of time has created the past... and history.
#823$#The past is like a shield, supporting the growth of the world and future life.|
98564|If only we could turn back time...|
98565|#822$#I can take you back to where you want to go.
#823$#Tell me, what point would you most like to go back to?
#821$#When you were little? Hm... That seems to be the hope of many people.|
98566|#822$#But going back to the past doesn't change anything.
#823$#So the most important thing is to not regret the past, right?|
98567|Make your memories beautiful.|
98568|#823$#And the most beautiful memory... is meeting you in this world.|
98569|#822$#What about you? Do you have any beautiful memories?
#823$#... Can't think of any now? No worries. Let me take a look at your past.
#821$#Well... You seem a bit nervous. Will I find something embarrassing in your past?|
98570|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98571|#822$#Split? Everything between us will be in the past...
#821$#I hope we can become beautiful memories of each other.|
98572|#822$#Sigh... how sad...
#823$#But I believe that our separation now prepares us for our reunion later.|
98573|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
98574|#821$#Superalloy... Electromagnetic UI... Ball of energy...
#822$#Hmm? Was I mumbling again? I'll have to pick up more equipment later.
#823$#Every day I assemble and develop new tech. It's my favorite activity!|
98575|#821$#Hmm... This circuit doesn't seem to match the power source...
#824$#Ahh... another failure! I'll have to find more suitable materials!
#822$#Let's go! Time to grab some new equipment! It's my favorite part of the day!|
98576|What do you know about the God of Battle?|

#823$#Hmm? Lacking confidence? Don't worry! Just leave it to me!|
98578|#821$#When fighting enemies, winning is of course the most important thing!
#823$#As long as you have my ultimate electrical weapon, you'll win for sure!|
98579|What do you think about power?|
98580|#821$#Technology is power!
#823$#My tech weapons are unbeatable!|
98581|#821$#Really, though, personal strength is the key to power. But everyone's different.
#822$#Some people are born with power, some are born with speed and agility...
#823$#To compensate for your own shortcomings, you can rely on the power of technology.|
98582|What does family mean to you?|
98583|#821$#Huh...? No! Don't ask me that!
#822$#I... I suddenly feel shy!|
98584|#821$#My sisters are my family! You, and you, too!
#822$#...can we perhaps skip this topic? I feel so shy...|
98585|What's the secret to lying?|
98586|#821$#You... Why would you ask me such a question? I don't lie!
#822$#What, you don't believe me? I've only snuck out a few times!
#821$#Ah... I said it......|
98587|#821$#You... why? Did you hear something from my big sister?!
#822$#I lied about watering the World Tree, and snuck out to buy mechanical parts...|
98588|What do you know about other lifeforms?|

#822$#The trees on the hills are as white as snow. They look beautiful!|
98590|#821$#I heard that very few outsiders can enter the Centaur homeland in Emerald Spring Peaks.

98591|About Quests.|
98592|#821$#Look! The exclamation marks on the map indicate that someone is signaling!
#822$#Just follow the signal and you'll find someone in need.
#823$#The more people we help, the more people?we'll meet in the future!|
98593|#821$#You must have a lot of responsibilities already, right?
#822$#A person who can take on so many is someone with true skills!
#823$#I'll help you deal with this. Keep it up!|
98594|Do you know anything about the Sanctuary?|
98595|#821$#Of course I do! There's a big plot of farmland inside!
#822$#It takes a long time to grow something with just manpower.
#823$#Leave it to me! I'll help you develop a handy farming machine.|
98596|#821$#I've heard there's lots of minerals in there, right?

#8232#Do you want to try my latest delivery device?
#823$#It's not just messages. You can even receive an item the second after you send it!|
98600|What is the World Tree?|
98601|#821$#It's a big tree in my hometown!
#822$#My sisters and I are always watering and guarding it.
#821$#But it's boring to stay there every day... so I snuck out!|
98602|#821$#It's a huge, important tree that supports the whole world!
#822$#It's very tiring to take care of it... that's why I like to invent new gadgets and tools.|
98603|I heard you have two older sisters.|
98604|#821$#Huh? Do you know my sisters?
#822$#Usually my oldest sister bugs me... every day, she says I'm obsessed with technology and invention!
#824$#Please don't tell her you saw me! She'll just bug me again!|
98605|#821$#Right! I have two older sisters! Big sister Urd, second sister Verdandi...
#822$#I'm not sure about Vera... Her malicious smile is creepy!|
98606|I've never seen a weapon like that before.|
98607|#821$#Oh, you noticed?
#822$#This is my favorite weapon! It took me a lot of time and effort to make it!
#823$#It's super destructive! Let me fire it up!|
98608|#823$#Yeah. Pretty, isn't it?
#821$#The Energy Ball at the center can store unlimited energy from the Alternate Dimension!
#822$#It took me a lot of effort to find the right materials to create it!|
98609|Your outfit is pretty.|
98610|#821$#Hmph! You have good taste!
#822$#This outfit is one of my creations!
#823$#These clothes are coated with special paint. They can withstand both high and low temperatures. Isn't that great?|
98611|#821$#This outfit is both beautiful and functional.
#822$#These shoes are equipped with high-speed devices that can teleport you.
#823$#Who invented such great equipment? Me, of course!|
98612|How do you feel about time?|
98613|#821$#Hmm... time... the future is of course the most important time of all!
#822$#Isn't everything you do now in preparation for the future?|
98614|#821$#The future is fascinating. It's filled with uncertainties. Just like the best adventures!
#822$#The fun is that every decision you make now will affect the future.|
98615|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98616|#821$#I can tell you a little secret about my sister!
#822$#She is actually a bit sentimental. She cries at even the most minor things.
#821$#We all call her the "Spring of Urd" because of her tears.|
98617|#821$#Have you met my second sister? Hmm? Verdandi
#822$#I advise you to stay away when you meet her because she likes playing pranks!
#821$#Hmph! I'm afraid she'll scare the daylights out of you!|
98618|Let's work together to create the future!|
98619|#821$#You mean to accomplish a great cause?
#823$#You have my full support! We make great partners!|
98620|#821$#I didn't expect you to be so ambitious about the future...
#822$#I was right about you! I've developed some amazing technology with your power!
#823$#Our future must be shining brightly!|
98621|Every day seems busy.|
98622|#821$#Busy? Hmm... am I busy?
#822$#Buying materials, drawing blueprints, running experiments, testing energy sources...
#821$#Haha! I'm really busy!|
98623|#821$#Hmph! Are you lonely because I'm not here for you?
#823$#Alright, alright! Let's go once this Mecha Equipment is ready!
#822$#Hmm... four or five hours should do it!|
98624|You run the future?|
98625|#821$#My sisters and I are in charge of the world's time. I'm responsible for the future.
#822$#The future is the most interesting phase of time and space. Everything is so up-to-date!|

#822$#You seem nervous. What, not ready to see your future?
#823$#Hmph! No worries! I'll stay with you!|
98630|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98631|#821$#You... you want to leave me?!
#824$#I didn't expect you to say such things... I thought we were fine...|
98632|#821$#Hmm? Are you going somewhere far away?
#822$#It's alright. Go! I'll find you anyway.
#823$#Because I've put a hidden tracking device on you!|
98633|What's your favorite leisure activity?|
98634|#821$#Sit on Ruby's body and follow the water to roam about!
#823$#It's always exciting to stream down from a high place!
#824$#What? Ruby can't carry you!|
98635|#821$#Umm... Go to a creek and find some little shrimp for a snack!
#824$#Gasp! How rude! I am also seafood?!
#824$#I... I... *sniff*... I and little shrimp are not the same species!|
98636|Are you a good fighter?|
98637|#822$#Umm... Are you underestimating me?
#823$#My precious bloodline endows me with great resistance!|
98638|#821$#Even if I can't win..., I can surely protect you from harm!
#822$#Just hide behind me at ease!|
98639|Changing seasons?|
98640|#821$#Umm... It's a little hot in summer...
#823$#However, my scales will glisten entrancingly in the sunlight!
#823$#Ruby likes it too, right?|
98641|#821$#In spring when ice and snow just melt into the river...
#821$#That's the best time for swimming!
#822$#Umm! Why don't you give it a try next time?
#823$#I'll watch out for you! I won't ever let you choke on water!|
98642|You look really cute.|
98643|#821$#That's what many fish say.
#822$#Umm... I am happy!
#822$#You have good taste like they do!|
98644|#821$#Thank you for your compliment.
#822$#I think you're cute, too!|
98645|What do you like to eat?|
98646|#821$#I love little shrimps that live in streams!
#821$#Cool and salty!
#822$#I'll save some for you next time!|
98647|#822$#The last time I went to visit Iwanaga-hime,
#821$#she made a cup of kelp tea for me...
#821$#That was delicious, too!|
98648|Do you know anything about the Sky Tower?|
98649|#821$#Umm... I've heard about it by the river!
#821$#It's said to contain the most precious and dreamy items!
#822$#Umm? I don't need any!
#823$I have Grandpa Big Fish and Brother Frog... and you!|
98650|#821$#Umm... Do you want to go there?
#822$#Don't worry! I'll be with you wherever you go!|
98651|Do you want to go somewhere?|
98652|#821$#I heard that there is a large lake to the east of the Viridian Steppe.
#823$#When the sunlight shines on the water, some beautiful scenery will appear.
#822$#Do you want to take me there?|
98653|#821$#Umm, have you been to the Frigga Peak?
#823$#It sounds like a perfect place for swimming!
#821$#Too cold? I'll lend you Ruby for hugging... That way, you won't feel cold!|
98654|About Enchantment.|
98655|#821$#Grandpa Big Fish mentioned it before.
#823$#Once an item is enchanted, its abilities will increase.
#822$#Umm... I wonder if I can enchant Ruby as well...|
98656|#823$#I know! It's a magical item that bestows glory upon its owner.
#821$#However, instead of believing in such illusory things, it's better to believe in me!
#822$#Here you go! Don't you want to look like a Goddess on her wedding day? My scale will bring you good luck!|
98657|Do you have a Guardian Knight?|
98658|#821$#One can have more than one Guardian Knight!
#821$#Umm... This way, you and Ruby won't fight.
#823$#You are both my Guardian Knights -- my most important loved ones!|
98659|#821$#Umm... Once the bond between two has reached a certain level, they can become the Guardian Knight for each other.
#823$#Looks like we already are each other's Guardian Knights!|
98660|Are you riding a goldfish?|
98661|#821$#Umm? Ruby?
#821$#I've known Ruby for as long as I can remember.
#822$#There's a solid bond between us...
#821$#Ah! I can tell you no more!|
98662|#821$#Ruby's real name is Rubina.
#823$#But don't you think Ruby sounds cuter?|
98663|Do you have a short memory?|
98664|#824$#Umm! Are you making fun of me?
#822$#Even Ruby's memory can last longer than seven seconds!|
98665|#821$#I remember everything that has happened after meeting Ruby!
#824$#How about before you met Ruby? Umm... I don't want to talk about that...|
98666|What do you think of fish tanks?|
98667|#822$#Umm...
#821$#One can be so happy living in the sea and by the stream!
#824$#Why live in such a small place?|
98668|#822$#You... think it's just a living place for fish?
#824$#No, no... It's also a terrible weapon...|
98669|Have you ever come down to walk by yourself?|
98670|#821$#Umm... Why?
#822$#Does Ruby dislike me because of my weight?
#824$#Boohoo... Please like me, Ruby!|
98671|#821$#Umm! I am a fish!
#822$#It's like you humans can't fly to the sky!
#823$#What? Glide?
#821$#You Envoys of Gaia are truly amazing!|
98672|Your outfit is so beautiful!|
98673|#821$#Right? This outfit is made of my scales!
#823$#If you see it inside the water, it will emit some beautiful light!|
98674|#821$#Umm, this is one solid proof of my precious bloodline.|
98675|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98676|#821$#Alice is a considerate sister...
#824$#But the cat in her arms often looks at Ruby with a mischievous expression...|
98677|#823$#Sister Undine is so beautiful!
#821$#She also smells of the sea!
#822$#But I often don't understand what she's saying...|
98678|Do you open your eyes when you sleep?|
98679|#822$#Sleeping...? Umm, isn't that Zafu's favorite leisure activity?
#823$#I still like swimming a bit more.|
98680|#821$#Only goldfish can do such a thing - sleeping with eyes open!
#824$#I... I... *sniff*... I'm no ordinary goldfish!|
98681|You have strong resistance?|
98682|#821$#Umm...
#822$#After all, I am from an important bloodline.
#821$#It can be traced back to a mysterious eastern country...|
98683|#821$#Look at this beautiful outfit made of scales!
#821$#It's not just beautiful!
#823$#It also offers strong immunity and defense!|
98684|There was once a woman who drowned...|
98685|#822$#Umm... I don't know what you're talking about...
#822$#If... if you want to tell a story, you should go to Aoandon!|
98686|#822$#...Boohoo!
#824$#Drop this subject now! Otherwise, I won't talk to you anymore!|
98687|Is there anything you don't like?|
98688|#821$#Gossip, you say? You must abide by what I'm going to tell you!
#822$#I don't like people calling me short. I don't like it at all!
#821$#Umm? Petite and short are two different things!|
98689|#821$#Some people who come to play by the river...
#821$#They would throw leftover bread and cups with a little drink into the river...
#824$#These things smell so strange... Umm... Why throw them in at all?|
98690|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98691|#822$#I will go back to the river...
#824$#That way... No one will find me cry...|
98692|#821$#Umm? But why are we parting ways?
#821$#Having Ruby with me..., I'll keep your company even if you head to the desert!
#823$#Ruby is the best!!|
98693|Your favorite leisure activity?|
98694|#821$#I used to go for walks with my mother in the flower field
#821$#to enjoy the vitality of the nature's fragrance.
#821$#Now? Now he'll just throw flowers right in front of me...
#822$#Hmm? Who? I didn't say who! You heard wrong!|
98695|#823$#Why don't you go to the Chamber of Commerce and hide your paperwork?
#822$#Angry? How dare he?|
98696|The strategy when facing a powerful enemy.|
98697|#821$#Someone's gonna be... even stronger?
#822$#Hmm? No... I didn't mention anyone...|
98698|#821$#No... Recruit him?
#822$#The Pandemonium Guard is incredibly short-handed...|
98699|What's your type?|
98700|#821$#Huh? I'm married!|
98701|#821$#You're not...
#821$#Let me remind you first.
#823$#We were not possible before!|
98702|Most unforgettable experience?|
98703|#821$#When I was a naive young lady,
#821$#a rash appeared.
#824$#Then they took me away like a bandit...
#822$#Hmph! I don't want to mention his name!|
98704|#821$#You know what?
#821$#It used to be only spring!
#821$#When I first saw winter...
#824$#You don't understand what kind of impact it has on me...|
98705|What do you like?|
98706|#821$#Sun, flowers, fruit...
#824$#What a beautiful smell!
#821$#But now... No way...|
98707|#821$#Red, Pomegranates...
#822$#Who? Who's blushing?!
#824$#I said it wasn't me! You rude human!|
98708|Where do you especially want to go?|
98709|#821$#The Crescent Hill Flower Field,
#823$#Mother often goes there too!|
98710|#821$#The Shattered Netherworld... It's a lot like where I live now...
#824$#Who wants to go there?! I didn't say I was going! I hate it!|
98711|Tell me about the harp.|
98712|#823$#No... there was once a harp master who pursued me!
#821$#But then he took the cloak and stopped showing himself...
#821$#I wonder what happened to him and his sister...|
98713|#821$#It can release an enchanting melody that can heal people's minds...
#821$#Huh? You say that it can even heal wounds?|
98714|Auction Site?|
98715|#822$#He told me where humans buy and sell things,
#821$#but I've always been curious.. Does nothing that's put there break?|
98716|#823$#I haven't seen it yet!
#821$#Let's go! Go show me what it can do!
#821$#Just... Buy red, Pomegranates! Hurry up!|
98717|Housing?|
98718|#821$#Your house must be taken care of!
#821$#Just like when I moved in... I see it dark.
#821$#No wonder that guy looked so icy...
#821$#Who? Who? Hmph! I didn't say anything!|
98719|#821$#Do you need me to help you with your courtyard?
#822$#I used to help my mother tidy up her garden.|
98720|Lady of Pandemonium?|
98721|#824$#I hate it! Don't call me that!
#824$#I'm old!|
98722|#824$#Don't remind me that I'm married!|
98723|Pomegranates.|
98724|#821$#Right! That used to be my favorite food!
#824$#Hmph! What's that look? Talk to me straight, human!|
98725|#821$#Apple is usually said to be the forbidden fruit in Eden,
#824$#but for me, the Pomegranate is my forbidden fruit.|
98726|Miss your mother?|
98727|#824$#Of course! Don't you miss it too?
#821$#No matter if it's getting married or adventuring..
#821$#They are all places that I'm familiar with...|
98728|#821$#Think...
#823$#It's all that big idiot's fault! That fool!|
98729|Where did you live?|
98730|#821$#Desolate Pandemonium... Where the dead souls go...
#824$#Aah! I miss life on the ground!|
98731|#821$#I used to live in a place filled with sweet nectar.
#821$#It was warm and fragrant...It was like heaven to me...|
98732|family.|
98733|#824$#I was raised here by my mother.
#821$#She taught me how to sing, and how to recognize plants...
#823$#Are you jealous?|
98734|#823$#Is that the big idiot?
#821$#Well, apart from him, there's also my quick little sister.
#821$#She's also got three brothers who are especially fond of walking...
#821$#They're all my family!|
98735|Tell me some interesting gossip about Eidolons.|
98736|#823$#I've heard that Ice fool has a lot of admirers,
#822$#but none of them are a match for me! Nothing to fear!
#824$#The only thing that needs to be on guard is... Cerberus!
#821$#His eyes are burning hot looking at that idiot!|
98737|#823$#Last time I saw Ares, I was so scared!
#822$#How come he's becoming so slovenly...?
#824$#Is he still thinking about my rejection?
#821$#Hmm? What's that look? Disrespectful human!|
98738|A lot of people are after you?|
98739|#821$#Hmm? Are there a lot?
#823$#You don't have anyone chasing you?|
98740|#823$#Hush! Keep it a secret!|
98741|Are there flowers in Pandemonium?|
98742|#821$#Of course not.
#821$#There's only Noda Castle that way,
#821$#and countless spirits...|
98743|#821$#You've seen the petals that dance around me, haven't you?
#821$#Once, I complained to that fool that Pandemonium had no flowers,
#821$#he then used his magic to make them for me...
#821$#he even made it into a very special pink..Hmph! Who knows what he's up to!|
98744|Your seat is a match with Hades'.|
98745|#821$#Of course, we are the Lord and Lady of Pandemonium.|
98746|#824$#I said no!
#821$#That idiot still insists on sitting on a great throne!|
98747|Mint¡K|
98748|#821$#...
#821$#It was just a little prank...
#824$#After I've recovered my senses, I'll help her recover her original appearance.|
98749|#821$#Is it hard to ask for fidelity?
#821$#He exiled me to Pandemonium!
#824$#That idiot! Didn't spare a thought for me!|
98750|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98751|#821$#Split up? Why?
#824$#It's rare to be able to get rid of that idiot!
#$822$$#I'm not leaving you to go back to Pandemonium!|
98752|#821$#This is the legendary...
#821$#You don't want it anymore?
#82$#You're a fool too! You fool!|
98753|Please introduce yourself.|
98754|#821$#I'm the great Kitsune Alina in charge of crops!
#822$#Respect the great family!
#824$#Yes...It's true! I'm not lying!|
98755|#821$#You want to know more about me?
#822$#But...I can't just tell you,
#822$#If you want to know more about me, come play with me!|
98756|What do you usually do?|
98757|#822$#Great gods are hardworking,
#821$#Ordinary people wouldn't understand!|
98758|#821$#Catching frogs! And looking for strange stones...
#824$#I'm not lazy! These are the important jobs of Gods!|
98759|What do you like?|
98760|#821$#I love things that I've never seen before.
#822$#What's that with you? Let me see!|
98761|#822$#The golden rice waves during the harvest season are the best!
#821$#Everyone is busy with the crops, so I can secretly play pranks.|
98762|I heard that foxes like to lie to people.|
98763|#824$# I'm not lying!
#824$#I am not a fox of pranks!
#824$#I am a Great God!|
98764|#821$#What are you talking about? I don't know anything!|
98765|What is the item in your hand?|
98766|#821$#This is Master Inari ...I...No, this is my beloved artifact!|
98767|#822$#This is a very powerful artifact from the shrine!
#821$#As long as I have this, I won't be afraid of any pranks!|
98768|Is there anywhere you want to go?|
98769|#823$#There are a lot of fun places I want to go!
#821$#I'll let you take me there!|
98770|#823$#If only everyone could live in a rich village...
#823$#That'd be great~
#821$#And if I am not going to get scolded for playing pranks,
#821$#And if I would be even rewarded with snacks, that's even better!|
98771|What days do you like?|
98772|#821$#Sunny days for pranks!
#823$#You can catch frogs on rainy days.
#821$#But the best day is to lie in the flower field of Crescent Hill in a warm morning.|
98773|#823$#I love festivals!
#821$#There are many offerings, and many people will come to play together.
#822$#It seems that Navea also held a grand celebration?
#821$#Take me there next time!|
98774|About the Sanctuary.|
98775|#821$#You're right to leave the crops to us!
#823$#Freshly harvested crops are the best for cooking!|
98776|#822$#Can you fish in the Sanctuary too? Sounds like fun!
#821$#It'd be even better if I could have some!|
98777|Let's talk about the Envoy's Path.|
98778|#822$#Are you going on an adventure? Sounds fun! Take me with you!|
98779|#823$#Everyone has different choices.
#821$#It's also fun thinking about how you want to grow up.|
98780|Who is the Fox?|
98781|#822$#Little Jade is my best friend. We're here to help God...
#821$#No, it's to help me, the greatest assistant of God.
#824$#Not someone who helps to clean up the mess!
#824$#And not a nanny!|
98782|#821$#Are you jealous? I'm the only one who can ride Little Jade!
#823$#It's so fluffy and fluffy, but I won't lend it to you.
#822$#Do you really want to ride? Aish, I guess you can ride it for a little while!|
98783|What is the job of being a God?|
98784|#821$#I have to protect the crops! It's hard!|
98785|#823$#It's hard finding time to prank during such busy work!
#822$#You should respect me more!|
98786|About the shrine.|
98787|#821$#The shrine is the home of God.
#822$#It's made of fragrant eucalyptus timbers and painted red. Very gorgeous!|
98788|#822$#All you need to do is to offer sincere prayers to the great God who lives in the shrine.
#821$#Gods give blessings to hardworking people!|
98789|Do you know Amaterasu?|
98790|#823$#Amaterasu is like the Boss of the Gods!
#821$#I don't know how to handle her...|
98791|#821$#Even though Amaterasu usually looks very reliable,
#821$#But sometimes they seems a bit childish.
#824$#Hmph! Who did you say is childish?|
98792|Why do they look like foxes?|
98793|#822$#Since ancient times, foxes have always served as Inari Amaterasu.
#821$#I... I am not just a little messenger!
#824$#I am a Great God! I'm not lying!|
98794|#822$#Huh? Are you jealous?
#822$#Look at this fluffy tail! And beautiful hair!
#821$#Only foxes have these!|
98795|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98796|#822$#I'll tell you a secret. But you can't tell anyone...
#821$#Actually, let's secretly exchange one of Idun's Golden Apple for a pear.|
98797|#823$#I've heard that Kotonoha is actually a beautiful fox!
#822$#A real fox is actually hiding,
#821$#Next time, I'll play a little prank so she can show her cute tail!|
98798|Other Gods.|
98799|#823$#There are eight million Gods on this prosperous land.
#822$#All living things contain their souls.
#822$#So take good care of the nature and its objects!
#821$#You have to respect my great family!|
98800|#822$#Unlike adults who are just pointing their way to the sky,
#821$#Our family is the great God who protect people at the forefront.
#823$#If you don't play with us, you'll be condemned!|
98801|Fried tofu!|
98802|#822$#Where is the fried tofu? Give it to me. I love fried tofu.|
98803|#821$#Hmph! You want to bribe me with just some fried tofu?
#822$#I am a great messenger. No... Great God!
#821$#But if you worship sincerely, I will eat a little bit!|
98804|The bird nest in the shrine.|
98805|#823$#Bird nests symbolize the division between the realms of Gods and humans.
#822$#Before entering the Azuria, you should greet with a respectful heart.|
98806|#823$#There are so many bird nests in the Inari Shrine.
#821$#People will give bird nests to the shrine as an offering for realizing their wishes.
#823$#That is to say, the more bird nests, the more people who have realized their wishes.
#822$#So you have to respect our great family.|
98807|Can I touch your tail?|
98808|#824$#Impudent fool! What...You want to touch my great holy fluffy tail?
#821$#But...If you could touch my head, I wouldn't let you touch it...
#822$#But you can only touch it for a moment, okay? You can only touch it for a moment!|
98809|#822$#Boohoo...Do you really want to touch it?
#822$#You can only touch it for a moment!
#822$#Don't touch strange places!
#822$#And be gentle!|
98810|Have you thought about your life after parting ways?|
98811|#822$#Yeah? Are you not playing with us anymore?
#824$#How dare you treat such powerful god with cruelty? I can't forgive this!
#821$#You'll have to be punished! I hope you're ready for new pranks!|
98812|#823$#Anything tangible will leave one day...
#821$#So let's have fun until that day comes!|
98813|Summer leisure activities?|
98814|#821$#Leisure activities...can be categorized by seasons...?
#822$#I only remember that missions should be completed no matter when...|
98815|#821$#What are proper summer leisure activities?
#821$#Can you...give me an example? I want to know more...|
98816|You look a lot livelier.|
98817|#821$#... Why would you think so? Did I look menacing??|
98818|#821$#If I look livelier..., will I make a lot of friends?|
98819|Can you swim?|
98820|#824$#I've been trained in all sorts of ways to achieve my mission.
#824$#Fighting in the water is one of them...
#824$#Hmm? Not combat?|
98821|#822$#If you're afraid of water,
#821$#I can carry you along by holding your waist.
#821$#Does that make you feel safer?|
98822|Will you go to the beach with someone you care about?|
98823|#821$#Why go to the beach? Does it mean something special?
#822$#Create shared memories... I don't really understand..., but it seems nice...
#822$#So will you go with me to the beach?|
98824|#821$#That guy... Will he go to the beach, too?
#822$#In order to keep him from messing around on the pristine beach...
#822$#Hmm? That's not what you mean by "care about"?|
98825|You're getting more emotional.|
98826|#822$#Am I? I don't feel that way myself...
#821$#Maybe because summer is coming? Does this have anything to do with summer?|
98827|#821$#In private...I used to practice smiling in front of a mirror...
#822$#Do I look strange?|
98828|Do you know about the Helonia Coast?|
98829|#821$#The Helonia Coast is now filled with people.
#821$#Everyone's face is beaming with happiness... Is this a trick of summer?|
98830|#821$#I've heard people talking about it on the road lately.
#822$#They say there's a beautiful beach perfect for volleyball over there.|
98831|Demon sightings have increased recently.|
98832|#821$#Demons' greed will never stop.
#821$#I will never forget my mission even in this bustling summer.
#824$#I'll kill them all with the Guardian.|
98833|#821$#Don't be afraid.
#824$#Let's fight together to protect the happiness of Terra!
#824$#And then we'll enjoy another summer together.|
98834|About Rockstar.|
98835|#822$#Guitar...?
#821$#No... I have no idea. Maybe you should ask Uriel...|
98836|#821$#When the Summer Music Festival on the Helonia Coast takes place,
#822$#you can see quite some people attending it with Guitars.|
98837|About Quests.|
98838|#822$#Quests...are missions?
#821$#Then my quest is to protect you.|
98839|#822$#For the sake of everyone's happiness...,
#821$#you have taken a lot of quests, right?
#823$#I'll always be with you.|
98840|Auction House.|
98841|#822$#Is there anything I'd like to purchase?
#821$#Swimsuit? For me? No... I'm fine with this one on me.|
98842|#822$#Tickets for the dolphin show?
#821$#No, I haven't seen one...because I've been fighting for my mission...|
98843|What do you think about war?|
98844|#821$#They say beach volleyball is also a kind of battle.
#824$#But it's one of the most enjoyable battles I've ever fought.|
98845|#824$#Summer...should be full of pleasant days...
#821$#This is such a heavy topic to talk about...|
98846|Can you fight in a swimsuit?|
98847|#824$#As long as I hold the Guardian in my hand..., I can continue fighting.|
98848|#822$#If it's to protect something important...,
#821$#I will be able to fight no matter what I wear.|
98849|Beautiful Wings|
98850|#821$#Thank you for your compliment, but the feathers always become heavy when I enter the water.|
98851|#822$#Don't worry...
#821$#If you're playing beach volleyball,
#822$#I'll put them all away.|
98852|Your weapon?|
98853|#821$#Do you mean the Guardian?
#824$#Its brilliant light can always lead me on the right path...
#824$#No, it's not for sunbathing...|
98854|#824$#It's called the Guardian, my favorite great sword,
#821$#and a partner that I never go without...
#821$#Surfing? Don't worry. It won't rust.|
98855|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98856|#821$#I heard that Nidhogg also changed into a swimsuit...
#822$#I hope she's just enjoying the atmosphere in Terra...
#821$#If she does anything dangerous..., I will protect Terra!|
98857|#822$#It seems the Moonshadow Band is going to hold an event next to the beach.
#821$#I see Uriel's been excited for days.
#821$#I hope he can restrain himself this time..., and start no fire...|
98858|Purple swimsuit.|
98859|#821$#Although I like pure white...
#824$#I am also happy with this swimsuit.|
98860|#821$#Do you think it looks good on me?
#822$#This is strongly recommended by Gabriel,
#822$#and I always appreciate her taste.|
98861|The halo on my head?|
98862|#822$#In order to match the overall feel of the swimsuit,
#821$#Uzuriel slightly adjusted the angle for me...
#821$#What do you think about it?|
98863|#821$#The summer sun seems to make it even brighter...|
98864|Sleepless Angel?|
98865|#821$#No one can stay awake all the time...
#821$#It's just that... I'm not used to letting others see my sleeping face...
#822$#Last time I went sunbathing, I tried my best to keep myself awake...|
98866|#821$#This title comes from some battle I fought...
#821$#My mission is to protect insistently,
#821$#but it doesn't keep me awake all night.|
98867|So, about companions...|
98868|#821$#We've surfed and drunk sorbets together...
#821$#Have we become closer friends?|
98869|#821$#Once...I had a partner I could support and trust,
#824$#and now...I have you by my side.|
98870|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
98871|#821$#Say goodbye? I just learned to enjoy the life in Terra...
#821$#Are we going to be apart so soon?|
98872|#821$#Is it because I threw that beach volleyball at your face a moment ago?
#821$#I'm sorry. I'm not going to do that next time.|
98873|What's your favorite food?|
98874|#821$#Mmm... I'm not picky.
#822$#Waterweed Appetizers, Starfish Risotto..I love eating everything!
#822$#Huh? No?|
98875|#821$#Why don't you tell me what you like first?
#821$#The food on land is something I've never seen before... It looks so interesting!|
98876|Do you like animals?|
98877|#821$#This chubby little sparrow will never stop chirping! So cute!
#821$#We don't have any sparrows in the sea...
#821$#Why...?|
98878|#821$#Last time I saw a little shaggy little thing with long ears on the way,
#821$#it looked so cute. Do you know what that is?|
98879|Can you swim?|
98880|#824$#Swimming? What is swimming?
#824$#Moving in the water?
#824$#Hmm? Isn't that easy?|
98881|#822$#If you don't know how to swim,
#821$#I can ask Grandpa Turtle to carry you around!|
98882|Can you ask about your weight?|
98883|#821$#What? I refuse to answer this question!|
98884|#821$#It's a secret!|
98885|You look great.|
98886|#822$#Huh? Yeah... That's a compliment, right?|
98887|#821$#Stop... stop looking at me...
#822$#I am very shy...|
98888|Is there anywhere you want to go?|
98889|#821$#I'm not familiar with Terra.
#821$#After all... I've only set foot on land recently...|
98890|#821$#Yes! There seems to be a place called Silent Ice Field.
#821$#Isn't that a place full of creatures from the sea?
#821$#Huh? The Ice formed an ice-shaped land on the ground...?
#821$#That sounds so complicated...|
98891|Have you heard of the Magic Division?|
98892|#821$#Huh? Humans can also use magic! What a surprise!
#821$#Will you? It's like guessing the pattern of a playing card...
#824$#Hmm? Magic is different from magic tricks?|
98893|#821$#Magic Division... Sounds like our Deep Sea Council...
#824$#Are there many serious Grandpas with white beards inside...?|
98894|What do you know about other lifeforms?|
98895|#822$#Hmm... The Sarpa seem to live among the sea...
#821$#But I've never seen them in the deep sea...
#821$#Are they only living on the beach?|
98896|#821$#That tribe we last passed by...
#822$#Hmm... It's called... Big Cat?
#822$#They're so welcoming! Just like our Ocean Palace!|
98897|What's your house like?|
98898|#822$#House... Where I live?
#821$#It's the Ocean Palace! Big! Beautiful!
#821$#The more important thing is that you can relax!|
98899|#822$#Invite people to my house
#821$#and then prepare gifts for them when they leave.
#823$#Isn't that a happy thing?|
98900|Auction House.|
98901|#822$#That's where you can get everything you want!
#821$#Need to have enough money? Hmm... I brought a lot of shells from the Ocean Palace.
#821$#Huh? No seashells? What about a pearl?|
98902|#822$#I... I also want to buy something!
#821$#Like... a Rainbow that will not disappear, a pencil that can write automatically...
#822$#Huh? They don't exist?|
98903|Urashima Taro|
98904|#821$#Hmm? He was the one who visited the Ocean Palace?
#824$#There are hundreds of banquets taking place daily in the Ocean Palace.
#824$#I can't remember every guest...|
98905|#821$#So he was a guy who helped turtles?
#824$#Because he saved Master Turtle's grandson he was invited to...
#824$#Hmm? Opening my Jade Box and get old? How can this be?|
98906|Jade Box|
98907|#824$#I'm here to prepare gifts for the Guests.
#824$#For you too, yes!
#824$#Come here. Huh? Master, why are you backing away?|
98908|#822$#There's been a strange rumor...
#821$#Saying that opening my box will make time fly.
#821$#There must be a mistake!|
98909|Are you a good fighter?|
98910|#821$#The Jellyfish, the Waterweed and the Coral Girl will all help me,
#821$#besides my fan!
#821$#I'm strong as a companion! So you can hide behind me!|
98911|#822$#Of course!
#821$#Ah... Don't tell my father about this...
#822$#It's said that his birthday wish this year is for me to become a lady...|
98912|Your weapon?|
98913|#821$#Hmm? That's my fan.
#824$#That's hard to tell, right?
#824$#My father told me girls can't fight...|
98914|#824$#Don't underestimate my fan.
#821$#It will get bigger when facing enemies!|
98915|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98916|#821$#Undine seems to be a princess...
#822$#I just don't understand...
#821$#What does slim mean?|
98917|#822$#Kingyo-hime is such a lovely child...
#821$#Too lively? How can this be?
#821$#People who like fish cannot be bad!|
98918|What's your favorite thing?|
98919|#821$#My nagging father, a gentle Jellyfish...
#821$#And the cute clown fish... And Master Turtle of Wisdom...
#824$#Everyone in the Ocean Palace are my favourite!|
98920|#821$#Hmm...This is the Jade Box that I cherish.
#822$#I like it, and I like you, too.
#822$#I'll give it to you, Master... Eh! Why does Master retreat every time?|
98921|Your outfit is astonishing!|
98922|#822$#Really?
#821$#I am not used to it...
#821$#It's hard to play with a big, fluffy dress...
#821$#But my father... Sigh... Let's not talk about this...|
98923|#821$#It's said that this outfit is a symbol of the princess's temperament and elegance.
#821$#Hmm...The good thing about a fluffy outfit is that it can be filled with hidden cupcakes and shell cakes...|
98924|Ocean Palace|
98925|#821$#My house is big...
#821$#Every time I want to get to the dining I can't help running...
#822$#And then my father scolds me...|
98926|#821$#My house holds several banquets every day!
#821$#It's full of drinks, cold cuts and cake.
#821$#But if I eat too much, my father will stare at me...|
98927|How did you come to Terra?|
98928|#821$#Through the water...Then I step on land...
#821$#And I met you!|
98929|#821$#This... I'm not sure...
#824$#But I must have come here to meet you!|
98930|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
98931|#821$#Never thought about it!
#821$#Because we're not going to be apart, right?|
98932|#821$#Urgh... No! No!
#821$#Don't leave me! I'll get lost in Terra!|
98933|What do you do to kill time?|
98934|#821$#Yeah? Are you asking because you feel lonely?
#823$#Do you want me to have some fun with the kitten?
#821$#Meow meow meow! I don't know how to refuse!|
98935|#821$#In order to bring joy to the dance at every ceremony,
#821$#You need to keep practicing and dancing. How can you think of free time?|
98936|What are your thoughts on art?|
98937|#821$#The small waist is swinging with the music.
#821$#Every time I step on the rhythm
#822$#Don't you think this is beautiful art?
#823$#Hmm... Speaking of which, my body is getting hot!|
98938|#822$#Come on, kitty! Listen up!
#821$#Music with a fast rhythm and high frequency,
#821$#and a moving body without control...
#823$#This is a kind of art|
98939|Your favorite animal?|
98940|#822$#Mmm... Guess what...|
98941|#822$#What a question!
#824$#Are you trying to provoke me?
#821$#What a naughty kitty!|
98942|How to deal with a powerful enemy.|
98943|#821$#Don't be afraid... Anyone who dares to scratch my kitten...
#821$#I will punish them without mercy...|
98944|#823$#Is the kitten trembling? It's so cute!
#821$#Then let me give you the guardian kiss of Goddess of War...
#823$#Don't step back, don't refuse me... This is the protection from Goddess! Meow|
98945|What is your impression of me?|
98946|#821$#Kitty is the cutest kitten I've ever seen!|
98947|#821$#Come here!
#822$#Come a little closer and I'll satisfy the kitten's curiosity!|

98949|#821$#Hmm... Battlefield...
#821$#It's a familiar smell of blood.
#822$#Bathing in blood and sword, it will also be a beautiful dance.|
98950|#821$#Hmm? Interested in war?
#821$#What a brave little kitten!
#822$#Come, accept the guardian kiss from Goddess!
#823$#Aiyo... The kitten's heartbeat is getting louder!|
98951|About the Cube of Gaia.|
98952|#822$#Speaking of which, I have to thank that cube...
#821$#Without it, I would never have met such a cute kitten!|
98953|#821$#The Cube of Gaia exudes a kind of enchanting magic.
#821$#Like...Hmm...A beautiful dance!|
98954|About Terra.|
98955|#822$#Humans of Terra
#822$#They emit a special and warm light.
#821$#Bright and dazzling... You can't take your eyes off of them...|
98956|#821$#The people here... are like you,
#822$#The same warmth, the same cuteness, the same happiness..
#822$#I can't help but to protect this happiness by all means...|
98957|About the harp.|
98958|#821$#Does the kitty want to learn to play the harp?
#823$#Then we can perform together.|
98959|#822$#Do you want to learn musical instruments?
#821$#Do you want me to teach the kitten to use a tuning fork?
#823$#Am I too close? Meow meow meow... I don't understand a no...|
98960|Do you have a Guardian Knight?|
98961|#822$#Protection...?
#823$#Hmm? Do you want to be my Guardian Knight?
#823$#Just say it! Do you want or not!|
98962|#822$#Hmm? Is this a proposal from Terra?
#821$#Do you want to kiss?
#823$#Aww, just kidding, you are blushing!|
98963|Tuning fork|
98964|#821$#Hmm? My tuning fork is no ordinary fork.
#821$#Not only can it make a loud voice, it also makes people dance
#821$#Do you want to try, little kitten?|
98965|#821$#Kitten is interested in my tuning fork.
#822$#This isn't a musical instrument. It's used for tuning.
#821$#Come on, let me teach you how to use it.|
98966|Goddess of War?|
98967|#824$#It's been a long time since I first earned that nickname.
#824$#For me now, playing with kittens is more important.|
98968|#822$#Hmm...
#821$#The kitten is interested in me!
#821$#I'm so happy!|
98969|Do you like sweet drinks?|
98970|#821$#Not as much as dancing.
#821$#But having some drinks is a must-have program at the festival.
#821$#That's why I've learned how to dance and drink at the same time.|
98971|#822$#But still...
#821$#I prefer kittens. Meow meow...|
98972|You smell that?|
98973|#821$#Smells good?
#824$#Would you like to go closer and smell it?
#824$#Ah! The little cat ran away!|
98974|#824$#I have lots of different fragrances here.
#821$#It's completely different from the cheap perfumes on the market.
#821$#Come closer! Let me help you.|
98975|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
98976|#821$#Bel-Chandra's Dance of Tandava is really beautiful...
#821$#One spin can change the world...
#823$#I'll invite her to the next ceremony!|
98977|#822$#Kitami is a cute little cat!
#821$#What? Is she a tiger or a cat?
#821$#Meow meow!|
98978|Tail.|
98979|#821$#Hmm...
#821$#My tail is private. What a naughty kitten.|
98980|#822$#Want to touch it?
#821$#Come closer if you want.
#823$#You can't touch it with such a distance.|
98981|Your outfit is astonishing!|
98982|#823$#This long yarn is particularly suitable for dancing.|
98983|#821$#Beautiful?
#821$#Are you fascinated by me?
#821$#Then come closer to me|
98984|You seem to be holding a Black Kitty all the time?|
98985|#821$#It's Gigi!
#824$#She has a name!
#821$#Kitty, remember it!|
98986|#821$#Gigi is my sister!
#821$#We can't leave each other.|
98987|Why do you call Maja the Mother Goddess?|
98988|#821$#Calling the Mother God's name!
#822$#The kitty is so naughty... You must be punished!|
98989|#821$#Meow meow!|
98990|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
98991|#822$#Come here, let me love you!
#821$#That way the cute little kitten won't be overthinking.|
98992|#821$#I'll keep dancing... I am starting to miss kittens...
#824$#We are not even apart yet... And I've started to miss the kittens. What should I do?|
98993|Do you know what Halloween is?|
98994|#821$#Are you kidding me?
#823$#It's... A festival where you can eat a lot of candy!|
98995|#823$#Halloween... You're talking about candies, right? A lot of candies!
#823$#It's a Sweet Tooth Festival!|
98996|There are ghosts on the road.|
98997|#821$#What? How come I didn't accept the judgment of Lord Osiris!
#821$#No...? Not that kind of ghost? What's that?
#822$#...... Hmm! Nakama is looking at me with his silly eyes!|
98998|#822$#No? Are you scared?
#821$#Hmm...The book says, "If you're afraid, wear a mask!"
#821$#Because masks can scare away the evil spirits|
98999|Do you like Pumpkins?|
99000|#821$#Hmm...The Pumpkin Bats are cute!
#821$#Lord Osiris has given me lots and lots of Pumpkin Bats|
99001|#822$#Pumpkin...? That should be what Endora likes!
#821$#As for Zephyrine... Hmm... I will like Pumpkin candies!|
99002|Do you like Halloween?|
99003|#821$#Yes!! I can meet lots of friends that I don't normally see.
#823$#It's like I'm back in Hades' Temple!|
99004|#823$#I like to play with everyone on the street!
#821$#But... It would be great if Lord Osiris could leave Hades Temple and come together!|
99005|How do I look?|
99006|#821$#Master... Are you going to join the parade?
#821$#Then take this basket! Bring back a lot of candy for Zephyrine!|
99007|#821$#The book says if you dress like a ghost! Then you don't have to worry about being taken away!|
99008|Jack O'Lantern|
99009|#821$#Does Master want to see the Jack O'Lantern?
#823$#There are lots of them near Lunarin in Crescent Hill!|
99010|#821$#Hehe Do you know?
#823$#Carving Pumpkins was originally intended to celebrate the harvest! Interesting, right?|
99011|Let's go to the city!|
99012|#821$#There's gonna be a lot of people on the street...
#823$#Nakama! Carry Zephyrine...And master!|
99013|#821$#The Apple bobbing game on the street evolved from a celebration in honor of Pomona.
#823$#Heehee! Do you think I know a lot?|
99014|Where would you like to go for Halloween?|
99015|#821$#If you want to experience Halloween,
#823$#Just go to the Oblitus Wood! Over there...
#821$#Huh? Master, why are you covering your ears?|
99016|#821$#Halloween in Terra is not real enough!
#821$#If you want to feel it...Return to the Hades Temple with me!|
99017|What's your house like?|
99018|#821$#Master, you want to change the decorations for the house?
#821$#You can give it to me! Zephyrine has read many books about architecture!
#821$#Like... Introduction to Space, Retro Architectural Trends...
#822$#......No! Nakama, what are you looking at?|
99019|#821$#Place the carved Pumpkin in front of the stairs,
#821$#You can scare away the evil spirits effectively.
#821$#Then you won't hear any strange sound at night!|
99020|Culinary Club|
99021|#821$#If you complete the Culinary Club's request,
#821$#You'll have a chance to get a big pumpkin that can drive away demons!
#822$#Let's get the Pumpkin on the stairs!|
99022|#821$#The Culinary Club has been selling toffee..
#821$#Don't you also want to eat the limited toffee apples!
#822$#...No, Nakama, don't pretend! Nakama wants to eat too, right?|
99023|Trading point|
99024|#821$#That's where you can buy shiny things! Right?|
99025|#823$#No? Master, it's too late to buy Halloween candy!|
99026|Nakama's Costume...|
99027|#821$#To protect Nakama from being captured by ghosts,
#821$#I helped Nakama dress up as a skeleton!
#823$#Am I nice?|
99028|#822$#Hmm...
#821$#Actually, it's not much different from how you looked before, right?
#821$#Do you want to dress up as a bat next time?
#821$#No...Damn! Nakama looks at me like this again... I am going to pinch your face!|
99029|Trick or Treat!|
99030|#821$##No...?
#821$#But you're already getting past the age for candies?
#821$#Don't be sad! I will share my candies with you!|
99031|#821$#Go trick! Go trick!
#823$#Nakama, come carry Zephyrine! Let's make trouble together!|
99032|Pranks?|
99033|#821$#No...Hmm...
#821$#In the book...It's not written...
#823$#Ask Nakama! Nakama knows!|
99034|#821$#Zephyrine knows!
#823$#Endora is the best to asking such questions!
#823$#How's that? Isn't Zephyrine intelligent?|
99035|Tell me something interesting about the other Eidolons.|
99036|#821$#I was supposed to march with Muramasa...
#821$#But he was more interested in ordering drinks...|
99037|#821$#I saw Hel at the parade!
#821$#But she seemed to be lost again...|
99038|Toffee apple!|
99039|#821$#Teehee! Watch out when you eat apples!
#823$#In the past, people put pins and blades in apples!
#823$#Isn't it terrible? But the book says so...|
99040|#821$#Master, do you want to compete biting apples?
#821$#Zephyrine is not going to lose. Because Nakama will help!
#824$#This...This is not cheating! Zephyrine and the Nakama are together!|
99041|Have you seen Zashi's Halloween costume?|
99042|#821$#He, he... she always said that it was secretly exchanged by Endora for her,
#823$#But she's actually very happy! You smile when you're sleeping!|
99043|#821$#Ever since I changed a new outfit, Zashi has always said that they are a Frog Hex.
#823$#Regardless of what I wear, I will always be Lord Orisis' guardian!|
99044|Wow, you're dressed for Halloween!|
99045|#821$#These decorations were given to Zephyrine by Lord Osiris!
#821$#Heehee! Are you envious of me too, Master?
#821$#...Nakama, if you keep looking at me like this...I'm gonna pinch your face!|
99046|#821$#Black and Orange are the Halloween colors.|
99047|Hades Temple|
99048|#821$#It's the home of Zephyrine, Nakama and Lord Osiris!
#821$#Ba, Bastet? She doesn't live there!|
99049|#821$#It's Lord Osiris' place of judgment!
#821$#No...Do you want to bring all the ghosts we've seen to Hades Temple?|
99050|Have you ever thought about what you'd do if we had to part ways?|
99051|#824$#I don't know!
#824$#I don't know about that!|
99052|#821$#Let's put Master in the Nakama!
#821$#We won't be apart!|

110009|A-are you tickling me...? Why don't I feel it?|
110010|What? Master's armor is very strong indeed!|
110011|Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing?|
110012|I'm not some pet animal for you to play with!|
110013|Lifting a rock chain is not enough. Let's take a look at this house next time!|
110014|The last time I practiced punching a hole in the house, it won't be found.|
110015|My creative inspiration escapes me...|
110016|What a reassuring touch.|
110017|Is this the latest social trend?|
110018|Uhh! That tickles!|
110019|Sister, please forgive me...|
110020|Why does Muse always stare at me? Did I do something wrong...?|
110021|Are you also charmed by my charisma?|
110022|Please enjoy the honor of being able to touch this handsome young master.|
110023|You! Did you wash your hands?|
110024|... What did you think I was?|
110025|I'm a truly charming and handsome gentleman.|
110026|The most intelligent and unique specimen in the world, that's me.|
110027|Do you also like my physique?|
110028|Do I smell sweet?|
110029|That sort of tickles.|
110030|How may I help?|
110031|I'm willing to put in extra effort for people I trust.|
110032|There's still a long way left to go to develop new sweets.|
110033|Can I touch Master as well?|
110034|So close... I'm deeply honored.|
110035|Touching is the closest distance between two people.|
110036|It's the most directly language of humans.|
110037|I have to record everything I've experienced in this place so I won't forget.|
110038|I still need to pursue higher knowledge to help me build an ideal country.|
110039|Would you like to give me a massage?|
110040|You must really want to get your boss' attention, hmm?|
110041|Take your filthy mits off me.|
110042|How dare you touch me without permission?|
110043|My good friend...|
110044|Is there anyone in the world who is as strong as I am?|
110045|You dare to provoke the mighty Sigrun?|
110046|I refuse to be defeated with tickles!|
110047|You! What are you doing?|
110048|What? Do you wish to duel?|
110049|Is cooking well...the skill of a good lady?!|
110050|I'm the goddess of war, Sigrun! Excellent! Said loud and clear just as one should!|
110051|Your gentle act reminds me of Chiyoda.|
110052|Why? I don't really know...|
110053|So much about you remains a mystery to me.|
110054|What do you want to do?|
110055|My best friend, Chiyome, is happy to see you!|
110056|Why do people kneel when they see me approach?|
110057|Oh, do I really smell like lilies?|
110058|Are you flattering me, by chance?|
110059|Tee-hee! I told you, that tickles!|
110060|All right. That's enough poking, okay?|
110061|Who am I to trust...?|
110062|Um... Is there any whitening product that actually works?|
110063|Are you in love with the future? This move must be intimate.|
110064|Your touch reminds me a bit of that man...|
110065|What? What do you need from me?|
110066|I can't stand such frivolous behavior.|
110067|I hate when people are unfaithful to their feelings.|
110068|That person... Where did he go?|
110069|Oh, only you would be so bold to touch me there.|
110070|Let me touch you too, then, and get a head start making mummies.|
110071|Do you want to be a mummy too?|
110072|Go away!|
110073|Let's test out this new curse that I created with Tanith.|
110074|Where should the newly-sewn mummies be placed?|
110075|Oh, what a lovely hand you have. Perfect for dancing...|
110076|Ha! Your hand is really restless, isn't it?|
110077|Do you want to touch this book instead, even though you risk being poisoned?|
110078|Do you envy my elegant physique?|
110079|One, two, two, three. Very good! You danced those steps perfectly!|
110080|Well, it's about time to start brewing new poisonous concoctions.|
110081|It's been so long since I last felt the warmth of a human...|
110082|This sort of touch makes the old man quite uncomfortable.|
110083|My dragon scales are lustrous and heathy, aren't they?|
110084|Are you interested in the old man?|
110085|I... What was I trying to do just now?|
110086|Time passes so quickly, I often forget what I've just done.|
110087|Does Master have a place to stay?|
110088|Can... Can I touch Master like this too?|
110089|It'll take some time to finish this.|
110090|Even if you keep tickling me, I refuse to lower myself by laughing.|
110091|I miss the ocean so much. Let's build a large swimming pool here!|
110092|It's my job to help Master organize the house, right?|
110093|Haha! I can catch up with my speed!|
110094|What? Want to go for a ride? You have to keep up with me!|
110095|Don't touch! I'm rather sensitive about my golden wings, you know?|
110096|Haha! Is touching each other like this popular thing to do these days?|
110097|The house is not well-designed. It's time to make a big hole and see the sky better.|
110098|Hey! Speed is power!|
110099|Want some money? Take it! I have more!|
110100|What? Do you want to buy something?|
110101|... Have you been short of money recently?|
110102|Easy now, I'm almost cleaned out.|
110103|The jewel pits are just looking for a place to be spent.|
110104|Problems that can be solved with money aren't real problems!|
110105|Psst... A little bit to the left... A little higher...|
110106|Psst psst...|
110107|Psst... Are you not afraid of being poisoned?|
110108|Hey, are your hands okay?|
110109|Psst psst... High temperatue toxins seem to have a curative effect on the virus.|
110110|Hey, this house really feels like home.|
110111|What's wrong with you?|
110112|Hahaha! Do you want to see the volcano with Laozi?|
110113|Is there something on me?|
110114|Go away!|
110115|Is this house sturdy? I could easily set fire to this whole place.|
110116|I still prefer lava than here.|
110117|A knight will not be shaken even if tickled.|
110118|It seems to be a bit like this between the knights.|
110119|What? Do you want to learn about the knight's spirit?|
110120|I'll tell you all that I know.|
110121|Lumikki always hides behind me. Does she mistake me for Prince Charming?|
110122|I always feel like someone wants to see me sitting.|
110123|It seems that Master also like me very much.|
110124|Master is touching me again. I'm really starting to feel shy.|
110125|Hm... No, really. I'm ticklish...|
110126|Especially on my tails! Pffft! No! I'm not laughing!|
110127|Um... Where did they hide the inari sushi and fried tofu?|
110128|The heart of the shoes... You want to make them even higher?|
110129|I'm not a kitten! I just don't like my stomach being touched, that's all!|
110130|Ohoho! You thought you could just touch me and walk away?|
110131|I'm just too perfect to resist, I understand.|
110132|Sigh... My handsome charisma is sinful!|
110133|I'm unmatched when it comes to the game of love, but why are things different when it comes to her?|
110134|Flowers, delicacies, fancy accessories... What else would capture her heart?|
110135|My well-trained physique isn't like yours!|
110136|Want to learn martial arts with me?|
110137|No matter how hard to you try, I won't succumb to your tickles.|
110138|Enough is enough. Quit touching me so much!|
110139|I wonder if my army could move into this house.|
110140|This house is way too boring! Look at how I'm transforming it into a big maze! An improvement, right?|
110141|Puff! How can you assault Chiyoda the ninja?!|
110142|Hm... Chiyoda must fight back!|
110143|...Puff! I'll laugh if you continue to touch me!|
110144|Hey! Chiyoda is very ticklish!|
110145|I'll visit Nalani in the evening to see the cute expression he wears when he's surprised!|
110146|The new ninjitsu moves are really complex... Hmmm! Fingers are tied!|
110147|Have you become one of my obsessive fans?|
110148|... Do you think I'm some sort of pet?|
110149|Your actions have offended me!|
110150|If you want to keep your hands, stop it this instance!|
110151|The rainy season is more irritating.|
110152|Oh, Tigerius Caesar doesn't give up. It's really interesting.|
110153|Serena loves this touch...|
110154|Hey now, stop ticking!|
110155|How about giving me some carrots instead?|
110156|Yeah, well... I'm actually super ticklish...|
110157|I have a lot of rabbits to take care of.|
110158|They're like little springs when they bounce! Boing boing! The little ones are the cutest.|
110159|H-hey! That's not a tickle!|
110160|Now I'm all itchy! If Serif sees, he'll get the wrong idea!|
110161|Hmmm! Your hands! Stay away from me!|
110162|Are you also one of my little fans?|
110163|Where is cute little Allen?|
110164|He, he... I thought of a good idea to prank that pink double ponytail...|
110165|Master of Southern Star once said... Only important people can do this...|
110166|This...is also part of spriritual practice...|
110167|...What?! Master...|
110168|You... Why are you touching me?|
110169|Master... Where are you bringing me to practice today?|
110170|Kid! When practicing, one should focus their mind on the task at hand. Don't go with strangers!|
110171|Does my pale skin intrigue you?|
110172|Your body temperature feels nice...|
110173|Haven't you any manners?|
110174|If you do, then please remove your hand at once.|
110175|I... When can I see him again...?|
110176|Cold, cold snow... Can I only feel this alone...?|
110177|I am Bravo! This handsome armor!|
110178|You think this machine is pretty awesome too, right?|
110179|Beep--! Initiating system unit cleaning.|
110180|Beep--! Human contact detected.|
110181|Beep--! Initiating standard maintenance program.|
110182|Beep--! Initiating standard backup memory setting.|
110183|Um... I don't hate this kind of contract.|
110184|This feeling of peace of mind, I've felt it before.|
110185|Huh? Are you blushing...?|
110186|Does touching me make you that happy?|
110187|Gram... I missed you so much...|
110188|Where is it? Where else is there something shiny?|
110189|Is this your way of expressing love? Then, I'll try it too.|
110190|I've received your feelings... You should receive mine too.|
110191|Do you prefer to express your feelings through actions?|
110192|Well, do what you want.|
110193|Today's sky is my favorite.|
110194|Meeting my destined person... It is my greatest joy.|
110195|Your desire to touch me... I understand now.|
110196|If I didn't trust you wholeheartedly... I wouldn't have let you.|
110197|You... Speak up! Stay where you are!|
110198|Stop what you're doing right now!|
110199|Hel...when can I meet her again...?|
110200|Alucard... Why do women scream when they see you?|
110201|Hahaha! There's something good about the feel of steel on skin.|
110202|Stop touching please! Are you looking for me?|
110203|Hahaha! Be careful with me!|
110204|Hmph! You could only feel the touch of cold steel, couldn't you?|
110205|Amaterasu always wants to be with me... I feel like I'm being watched!|
110206|Although I shake off Amaterasu and wander alone, my current strenght won't allow me to...|
110207|My brother Hansel often touches my head.|
110208|Did Master know that I also like to touch his head?|
110209|He saus that no one else should touch it, though...|
110210|Go ahead and touch me if you want! Don't touch Gretel!|
110211|Brother, do you like apple pie or cake better?|
110212|Gretel, I promise I'll always be there to protect you!|
110213|Well, if it's you... I think I can accept such behavior.|
110214|Tee-hee! But I was healed instead!|
110215|Tsk. Such behavior... It just doesn't seem appropriate.|
110216|... Are you curious what my hair feels like?|
110217|The golden apple from back then... Someone's making a mockery of us...|
110218|What can we do to help them reconcile?|
110219|Master... D-don't touch it...|
110220|Just let Master touch his hand... Can you capture Master's heart?|
110221|D-don't touch it...|
110222|If you touch it again... I'll scream!|
110223|We're still missing a lot of members of the orchestra. Who else is suitable?|
110224|Where are you going to play with Serena tomorrow? No... I don't like her!|
110225|I won't reject Master!|
110226|I only allow people I like to touch me. Do you understand now, Master?|
110227|Oh! You can't simply touch as you wish!|
110228|Hm... Where do you want to go?|
110229|I dressed up extra nice today. Does it please you, Master?|
110230|Um, why were you late coming back? I can help Master warm up the bed for better sleep.|
110231|Wow! How strange you are! Is it lack of exercise?|
110232|Speaking of physical touch... Isn't just that street fighting?|
110233|Wow! I'm scared!|
110234|Hahaha! Don't just envy my pecs, let's exercise together!|
110235|Haha! I just thought of a way to take Bealdor down a peg or two!|
110236|Who will follow me into bloody battle?|
110237|Did you just pat my head...? Don't go treating me like a kid!|
110238|I'll let you hold my hand just this once.|
110239|Oh, you really are bold...|
110240|Aren't you afraid of getting burned?|
110241|Ah, Kusanagi is being naughty again...|
110242|Will it be sunny tomorrow? Kusanagi and I agreed to go out for a walk!|
110243|I really envy Master's power... Oh! I didn't say anything!|
110244|If Master pats me like this, will I grow stronger?|
110245|What's that? Did I make a mess of myself?|
110246|Ha! Watch out for my skirt.|
110247|Hansel and Gretel have been invited to afternoon tea tomorrow.|
110248|When will we be able to take the Power of Gaia as our own?|
110249|I also want to touch Master's head.|
110250|¡@Master touched it... Finnel was hungry...|
110251|Hey? No treats, no touching!|
110252|The tail is off limits.|
110253|So hungry! Where's all the meat around here? Braaaainnsss...|
110254|Hey... I don't eat nearly enough meat these days...|
110255|Time...brings us closer.|
110256|I wish I could freeze this moment in time.|
110257|Your fingers are bit cold... Are you sick?|
110258|Everything you do will be recorded.|
110259|Library datebase... It's time to tidy that up...|
110260|Um... Recently, my vision has gotten worse...|
110261|Master... This... That doesn't seem very polite.|
110262|Hmm... I'm...flattered.|
110263|Is this in a friendly way...?|
110264|... You'd better touch Ruffles.|
110265|In order to be able to conquer the world with Master, I must work harder!|
110266|Diao Chan has been introducing me to a lot of people lately... But how can I say no?|
110267|Um... It's only Master... I thought it was Nakama...|
110268|You can touch only the head... Don't move your hands.|
110269|Ah, I really thought it was Nakama...|
110270|Enough! Don't mess up!|
110271|Nakama is pretending to be Zephyrine today.|
110272|Alright! For tonight's dinner I've decided to have sashimi, fresh internal organs...and the Master!|
110273|Humans... You taste better than I thought.|
110274|Humans... So boring!|
110275|Aren't you tired of living, humans?|
110276|Get lost!|
110277|How tedious to live such a comfortable and carefree life.|
110278|Humans are such a weak race. Just look at their flimsy houses.|
110279|You can touch only my hand...|
110280|We...have a pretty close relationship, right?|
110281|Physical touch is something only people close to one another can share.|
110282|Hey... You've messed up my hair!|
110283|I have a new song and want to play it for those important to me.|
110284|I haven't dance in a long time... I don't even know if I'm any good at it anymore...|
110285|I can bring Master good luck, so go ahead and touch me more, okay?|
110286|Hm... So sleepy... Master is next to...zzzz... Snort!|
110287|Huh? Me? I wasn't sleeping!|
110288|Haha! They woke up.|
110289|Hm... Today is also a good nap day...|
110290|I don't know if Master will buy the delicious crackers again...|
110291|Ah, Master, you're a bad fan!|
110292|Master sure is a sneaky one! The idol hasn't arrived yet.|
110293|To contact the idol, please contact their agent first.|
110294|The idol's head can't be touched.|
110295|When is the next tour date?|
110296|Did Yates come up with a new song? Going to prepare for the next album!|
110297|Snowie likes the Master's warm hand.|
110298|Master... Are we trying to date?|
110299|Only Prince Charming can touch me.|
110300|I'm not a kid... Stop tickling me!|
110301|I just adore soft, fuzzy little animals.|
110302|My Prince Charming will appear today.|
110303|Are you healing the wound on my hand?|
110304|Hey, watch what you're doing with those fingers!|
110305|You, don't touch my hand.|
110306|You're getting ahead of yourself!|
110307|The God of War is valued for strength not height!|
110308|Where did Ayako go?|
110309|Go get 'em, Lassie! Bite 'em hard!|
110310|Ugh! Don't touch me! Have you forgotten your duty as a servant?|
110311|Rude! Only Dante is worthy of that honor.|
110312|Hands off! Don't think you can approach me so easily.|
110313|Ah, as for Dante...|
110314|If I'm quick about it, I might be able to steal a piece of his clothing...|
110315|Hey... You, um, didn't hear that just now. All right, Master?|
110316|I do like you most, after all... Pet me... Quickly, please pet me!|
110317|Meow! Meow! Who are you?|
110318|Hey, you! You snuck up and scared poor Kitami!|
110319|I think I'll take my nap in a tree today.|
110320|Hey... Master will come back soon to accompany Kitami...|
110321|Master, do you want to become a Slime like me?|
110322|He, he... But I'm smooth as silk! Isn't it nice?|
110323|Only Master can pat other people's heads...|
110324|Your fingers are hot...|
110325|When will Master play with me again?|
110326|Has Master figured out that I'm actually a Slime?|
110327|Tee-hee! Aren't you going to let me pat your head too?|
110328|Um... What are you blushing for?|
110329|Oh! Is there something you want?|
110330|Hm... Honestly, your hand is really restless.|
110331|The beauty of destiny is something I won't ever get bored of watching.|
110332|What's most important is to have fun in the now. Right, Tungsten?|
110333|I only agreed that you're strong not that you could touch me!|
110334|Is this really the way to connect feelings?|
110335|Speak up! What do you have to do it?|
110336|So... Are you having trouble developing weapons?|
110337|A machine gun that can shoot enemy bombs, that's certainly worth researching!|
110338|Jackson, Jack, Charlie, Chuck... Very good! Very good condition!|
110339|It's a strange feeling.|
110340|Do friends often touch...?|
110341|Is this a way of expressing your emotions?|
110342|D-don't touch my wings!|
110343|This world... It's not just black and white...|
110344|Is it possible to make friends with only a smile? Yes... This?|
110345|There you go laughing again... Master...|
110346|If you betray me... I'll kick you in the face!|
110347|I'm a samurai and samurai don't feel t-ticklish...|
110348|Honestly, what do you get out of patting my head? Pervert!|
110349|... Where does Master hide the wine?|
110350|It sure is easy living with Master...|
110351|Hehehe! You went and prepared afternoon tea for me?|
110352|I suppose I'll allow to touch...one more time.|
110353|You! How dare you touch a lady's hand!|
110354|What! Are you allowed to be this close to me?|
110355|This is the ultra-exclusive perfume that I made... Who should I test it out on?|
110356|I wonder what Sabas has prepared for afternoon tea today?|
110357|I won't reject such a touch.|
110358|You're the first person who has ever dared to get this close to me.|
110359|Um... You dare to touch me without permission! I assume you're ready to pay the price!|
110360|You're too close! Watch out for the dead spirit!|
110361|I recently dreamed of that person...|
110362|If you were to die, you'd be able to stay with me forever.|
110363|... Your hand is still so warm.|
110364|... The next time a ghost story comes out of your mouth... I'm going to ignore you.|
110365|Do you know what a satyr is? Shouldn't you?|
110366|Ah, that tickles! Stop tickling me!|
110367|This must be what it feels like to be spoiled. Meow!|
110368|Today's goal is to clean the second floor.|
110369|Hey... Is this Master's hand I feel...?|
110370|When Master pats my head, I can feel Master's warmth.|
110371|Hey, this touch... Whose hand is it?|
110372|Just the simple act of patting someone's head sets them at ease.|
110373|The weather is perfect today. A beautiful sky awaits us!|
110374|I must admit, I missed Master's voice a little.|
110375|Tee-hee! Ha, counterattack! Now I've touched your head too, Master!|
110376|Oh, Master's hand is so warm.|
110377|Okay? Would you like me to pat your head too?|
110378|Petra... Please behave and try to get alone with everyone.|
110379|Hoohoo! Where does Petra want to go exploring today?|
110380|Flower need tender loving care to grow up beautifully.|
110381|Who gave you permission to touch me?|
110382|... You interrupted the king's thoughts.|
110383|I was contemplating something serious.|
110384|I will not entertain rudeness.|
110385|The strong are fearless, and the king is not afraid.|
110386|You think me too strict?|
110387|No more touching Hermes!|
110388|Yeah, too muh power!|
110389|Hey! Don't touch! Now I feel itchy.|
110390|Are you finished? Ugh. I feel like I need to sneeze.|
110391|Um... Will you meet with me later today?|
110392|The boss left with the dog again, but I wanted to go too...|
110393|Um... Annoying... Where are you touching?|
110394|We're also shy...|
110395|Eh? Who is it...?|
110396|Don't disturb my sleep.|
110397|I like to watch interesting dreams.|
110398|Hm... We like to turn off the lights when we go to sleep at night.|
110399|My little brothers also want Master to pet them.|
110400|Does Master want to go for a walk with me?|
110401|Yay! The object you like can touch me!|
110402|Go and pet my lovely brothers too.|
110403|Green Flame and Purple Flame are cute as always today!|
110404|Master is taking me out today! So excited!|
110405|My hair is very fluffy and lovely to touch.|
110406|Master also wants a Golden Apple?|
110407|Aw, I'm scared!|
110408|No, no! I've got the Golden Apple right here in my hand.|
110409|One sheep, two sheep, three... Oh! Be careful around Cerberus and his brothers!|
110410|Little lamb, are you on your way home?|
110411|Instead of hanging around here, you should be training to become stronger.|
110412|What? Want to fight me?|
110413|... Want to feel my knife buried in your chest?|
110414|... The strong aren't used to such contact.|
110415|Let's dine on a tasty soul for dinner tonight, hmm?|
110416|If I transform back into a dragon, won't this house be destroyed?|
110417|Wh-what happened? You're so close all of sudden!|
110418|... Your eyes look strange...|
110419|Even if it's Christmas, my Heroic Glory isn't something you can touch freely!|
110420|Hands off now... What? The Heroic Glory won't succumb to tickles!|
110421|Are you going to bake gingerbread? Forget it... I prefer barbecue.|
110422|Is it a good idea to wish upon a star atop the Christmas tree? That height...|
110423|Master smells good. Tee-hee!|
110424|My face feels hot all of a sudden.|
110425|Hey, do you want some of my meat?|
110426|If you pat me, you can have some.|
110427|I can't wait to show off my new clothes to everyone.|
110428|Christmas meat, Christmas meat! Tee-hee!|
110429|Only you can heal the injury on my back.|
110430|Oh... Your hand, it's...warm.|
110431|Please don't come any closer. I still can't endure human temperature...|
110432|Let's just keep a little distance between us, okay?|
110433|This home here is much more comfortable than a cage.|
110434|Um... Where should I hide happiness?|
110435|Pervert! Pervert! You worse than a disgusting leech!|
110436|Master... If you keep laughing like that... I'll tell Kabuto.|
110437|Which do you prefer, being trampled or cut in half?|
110438|... I feel so different, so happy!|
110439|Huh? What about my wine? Kabuto! Did you steal it?|
110440|As expected, a fine wine to celebrate the new year.|
110441|You're quite lovely, little sister.|
110442|Oh, well, it takes a lot of work to maintain skin this flawless.|
110443|Hm... What makes ordinary people think they can touch me?|
110444|What an audacious commoner!|
110445|Oh! What a beautiful girl she is...|
110446|A brilliant crimson, perfectly suited to the nobility.|
110447|I said I'd give you my back, but that didn't mean you could go and touch it.|
110448|If you're in trouble, I'll be right there to help you!|
110449|You! You scared me! What happened? Have you met with difficulties?|
110450|If you come any closer, then I'll... Oh no, that tickles!|
110451|Um... Where else are there people who need help?|
110452|I want to be stronger! Only then can we face all challenges, big and small, together!|
110453|I'll allow you to touch my sleeve before the fire burns out.|
110454|My body is rather cold...|
110455|If you want to touch me, you'll have to tell me a story...|
110456|Ready to tell each other stories...?|
110457|Tonight. Yes, tonight is a perfect one for lanterns.|
110458|Oh... The story isn't over yet, so don't leave me.|
110459|I like the feel of your touch.|
110460|Haha! You must really like me a lot, huh?|
110461|Hey! Don't touch my hair.|
110462|Is it really okay to touch it like this?|
110463|Um... I want to use gold foil essential oil to protect my hair this time.|
110464|I can't let the other discover my secret...|
110465|Hahaha! I see you're fascinated by my muscles!|
110466|But I can't share this body with you.|
110467|Hey! Is there something you want?|
110468|Go! Go! Go! Don't bother me!|
110469|I have never suffered defeat on the battlefield! The other side pulls dirty tricks is all!|
110470|Hey, I didn't do anything! Why am I to blame?|
110471|Your touch feels warmer than the sun.|
110472|No need to worry, I won't catch a cold.|
110473|Your touch is too passionate for me.|
110474|The way you're looking at me feels a bit dangerous.|
110475|Even if I'm dressed in fancy clothes, I'm still me.|
110476|A sunny day like this reminds me of when we first met.|
110477|If we destroy the world, it wouldn't be so hot.|
110478|Ah, yes, it's much too hot. We shouldn't get too close.|
110479|... It's too hot. Don't come near me!|
110480|Or do you want to struck down?|
110481|The heat of the sun is as irritating as the weak!|
110482|Get rid of the weak, and everything will become cooler.|
110483|Y-you... If you get this close to me, I'll feel shy...|
110484|Let's admire the moonlight together, shall we?|
110485|... Do I know you?|
110486|Are your hands clean?|
110487|Um... Why isn't it nighttime yet?|
110488|Ah, this house appears to have stood abandoned for quite some time.|
110489|Your face, I could gaze upon it for eternity.|
110490|I'm freezing. Come into my arms and let me warm you up.|
110491|What's the matter? Touching so casually like this... It might lead to misunderstandings.|
110492|Is there anything I can help with?|
110493|If a heavy snow falls here, we can hold a snowball fight with him.|
110494|This is a good angle. Admiring the aurora is sort of romantic, don't you think?|
110495|Hmm? Is Master uncomfortable? People like it very much... Zzzz...|
110496|I've been good lately, Master, so please pat me more.|
110497|Okay? Can you see me too?|
110498|Hey now... Master said not to play with strangers...|
110499|Hm... I'll lay out my quilt and sleep well very, I think!|
110500|Um... Now, where is the best place to roll out my quilt?|
110501|Hee... Floret likes to be touched on the head like this...|
110502|This touch is so warm, like Floret is surrounded by petals...|
110503|Teehee... Do you like flowers too?|
110504|Hmm... Floret is busy now!|
110505|Hee... Floret wants to fill this place with cherry blossoms...|
110506|There are too few flowers here... This is not good!|
110507|You are my prince charming!|
110508|I like master the most.|
110509|My mama told me not to talk to strangers...|
110510|Are you Master's friend?|
110511|Will Master like my new outfit?|
110512|If it snows everywhere, Master and I can have a snowball fight!|
110513|Your power flows through your hands into me. Hmm? No?|
110514|Your hands are so warm, what magic is this?|
110515|Is Christmas celebrated in Wonderland?|
110516|Are you an Envoy of Gaia? Then your powers must be...|
110517|I heard your powers will strengthen during Christmas. Why don't we...|
110518|This seems like a good place for a tea party.|
110519|You dare touch me?|
110520|Prepare to be punished for disturbing me.|
110521|Do you want to keep your hands?|
110522|Get out of my sight.|
110523|You want me to live in this shabby hole?|
110524|I'll turn this place into a palace of ice.|
110525|Master, would you like to make tea with me today?|
110526|Your house is beautiful.|
110527|Huh? Huh? Yes, a stranger...|
110528|Stop following me!|
110529|I think I miss Little Flower...|
110530|Wait... Stay here... Two aren't too many, right?|
110531|Do you want to go back to the past?|
110532|Your past is quite exciting.|
110533|Hmm... I'm thinking about something.|
110534|What's up? Is something wrong?|
110535|It's so beautiful. I'm sure there were a lot of memories here.|
110536|Hmm... I'd like to summon a portal to the past here.|
110537|I don't have enough tools. Can you get me some more?|
110538|Want to play with me? I'll finish this!|
110539|What's wrong? Have we met before?|
110540|Come back later, I'm busy!|
110541|Where can I build a lab?|
110542|There's energy at work here!|
110543|Stroke Ruby too when you stroke me!|
110544|Are you going to take me out with you? Ruby will be happy, too!|
110545|Umm!|
110546|You...stroked me!|
110547|Ruby, do you want to go surfing?|
110548|Umm... I want very much to go out and play with water!|
110549|Ah! Scared me! Why did you do the same thing as that idiot?|
110550|You've eaten all the Pomegranates! Help me get some more quickly!|
110551|Ahhh, here have some Pomegranate! You'll have to stay here and keep me company then!|
110552|Be careful! Butterfly wings are very fragile!|
110553|I'll hit the field...|
110554|Is it my destiny to be locked in a place? I'm gonna sneak out of town!|
110555|Ah! I'm...practicing smiling.|
110556|I want to protect you by your side.|
110557|Should I...stroke you, too?|
110558|Wet? That's because I was feeding dolphins...|
110559|I'm not used to taking off my armor...|
110560|You can see white clouds from this angle.|
110561|I am soft?|
110562|Don't say I'm fat!|
110563|Ah, I got the clothes!|
110564|Would you like me to prepare a Jade Box for you?|
110565|Temperament... You can't just run around...|
110566|I want to lie on a big shell bed and roll.|
110567|Hm? Where are you going to find this?|
110568|Come closer, come closer...|
110569|Meow meow!|
110570|It's a cute little cat!|
110571|I feel like I can practice another melody today.|
110572|Gigi! You ate too many fish today!|
110573|Master, let's pinch Nakama's face together!|
110574|Would you like to come with me and Nakama for candy?|
110575|Don't move! Hand over all the candy!|
110576|Candy... I still want to trick or treat!|
110577|The streets are bustling with activity. There are so many souls awaiting judgment...|
110578|Nakama...You should be able to get a lot of candy!|
